10201398,"Quaternary changes in topoisomerase II may direct orthogonal movement of two DNA strands. Type II DNA topoisomerases mediate the passage of one DNA duplex through a transient break in another, an event essential for chromosome segregation and cell viability. The active sites of the type II topoisomerase dimer associate covalently with the DNA break-points and must separate by at least the width of the second DNA duplex to accommodate transport. A new structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae topoisomerase II DNA-binding and cleavage core suggests that in addition to conformational changes in the DNA-opening platform, a dramatic reorganization of accessory domains may occur during catalysis. These conformational differences have implications for both the DNA-breaking and duplex-transport events in the topo II reaction mechanism, suggest a mechanism by which two distinct drug-resistance loci interact, and illustrate the scope of structural changes in the cycling of molecular machines.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,19,pos_MEDLINE,0.996108,1
10208428,"Comparison of the effectiveness of adenovirus vectors expressing cyclin kinase inhibitors p16INK4A, p18INK4C, p19INK4D, p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27KIP1 in inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and inhibition of tumorigenicity. Cell cycle regulatory proteins are important candidates for therapeutic tumour suppressors. Adenovirus vectors were constructed to overexpress cyclin kinase inhibitors p16INK4A, p18INK4C, p19INK4D, p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27KIP1 under the control of the murine cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter. These vectors directed the efficient expression of each of the cyclin kinase inhibitors and induced growth arrest, inhibited DNA synthesis, and prevented phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) in cell lines expressing functional pRb. In pRb-deficient cells, expression of the cyclin kinase inhibitors was not effective in inhibiting DNA replication or growth arrest. Interestingly, three of the cyclin kinase inhibitors, p16, p18 and p27 were found to induce apoptotic death in transduced HeLa and A549 cells. When the vectors were tested for their ability to inhibit tumorigenicity in a polyomavirus middle T antigen model of murine breast carcinoma, expression of the cyclin kinase inhibitors resulted in a delay in tumour formation that varied from several weeks for the p19 expressing vector to greater than 25 weeks for the p27 expressing vector. When tumours were injected directly with the adenovirus vectors expressing the cyclin kinase inhibitors, only treatment with the vector expressing p16 resulted in a delay in tumour growth.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,23,pos_MEDLINE,0.13701202,0

An ATP-binding domain of human Hsp70 protein has been crystallized in two major morphological forms at pH 7.0 in the presence of PEG 8000 and CaCl2. Both crystal forms belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, but show no resemblance in unit-cell parameters. Analysis of the crystal structures for both forms shows a 1-2 A shift of one of the subdomains of the protein.

10231520,"Solution structure of the chicken cysteine-rich protein, CRP1, a double-LIM protein implicated in muscle differentiation. The mechanism by which the contractile machinery of muscle is assembled and maintained is not well-understood. Members of the cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family have been implicated in these processes. Three vertebrate CRPs (CRP1-3) that exhibit developmentally regulated muscle-specific expression have been identified. All three proteins are associated with the actin cytoskeleton, and one has been shown to be required for striated muscle structure and function. The vertebrate CRPs identified to date display a similar molecular architecture; each protein is comprised of two tandemly arrayed LIM domains, protein-binding motifs found in a number of proteins with roles in cell differentiation. Each LIM domain coordinates two Zn(II) ions that are bound independently in CCHC (C=Cys, H=His) and CCCC modules. Here we describe the solution structure of chicken CRP1 determined by homonuclear and 1H-15N heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Comparison of the structures of the two LIM domains of CRP1 reveals a high degree of similarity in their tertiary folds. In addition, the two component LIM domains represent two completely independent folding units and exhibit no apparent interactions with each other. The structural independence and spatial separation of the two LIM domains of CRP1 are compatible with an adapter or linker role for the protein.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,31,pos_MEDLINE,0.99812883,1

This study is an investigation of the effectiveness of an individually administered mood induction procedure compared with an equivalent procedure administered to a group. Seventy-nine nondepressed individuals (25 men, 54 women) were randomly assigned to either a depressive or a neutral mood induction in an individual or a group setting. In each procedure, the mood induction involved the Velten self-statement procedure (E. Velten, 1968) enhanced by related mood music. Overall, both the individual and group induction procedures were effective in producing a depressed mood state, and their effectiveness was unrelated to social desirability or the sex of the participant. However, the group procedure was more vulnerable to individual differences in response, and its use in research on depression requires stringent criteria for mood change.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,33,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0024201944,0
10329190,"Oct-1 POU and octamer DNA co-operate to recognise the Bob-1 transcription co-activator via induced folding. The expression of immunoglobulin genes is controlled in part by the DNA-binding protein Oct-1 and the B cell-specific transcription co-activator, Bob1 (also known as OCA-B or OBF-1) that together form a complex on the Igkappa promoter. We have characterised the assembly of the ternary complex using biophysical methods. Bob1 binds specifically as a monomer to the complex of the Oct-1 DNA-binding domain (Oct-1 POU) and the Igkappa promoter, but binds weakly to either Oct-1 POU or the Igkappa promoter alone, indicating that both are required to make an avid complex. Ternary complex formation requires a defined DNA sequence, as the stability of the complex can be strongly affected by a single base-pair change or by removing 5-methyl groups from selected thymine bases.In isolation, Bob1 appears to have little secondary structure, but may become partially structured upon recruitment into the ternary complex as demonstrated by circular dichroism spectra and calorimetry. These and other findings suggest that ternary complex formation requires a defined geometry of the POU/DNA complex, and that the co-activator makes stereo-specific contacts to both the POU protein and the major groove of the DNA that induces its fold.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,37,pos_MEDLINE,0.9971439,1

Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial Multicenter Cooperative Research Group (ONMRG). BACKGROUND A randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted in 1991 to compare an intravenous megadose of methylprednisolone with a control drug (mecobalamin) for treating acute idiopathic optic neuritis. CASES Sixty-six cases from 22 clinical centers throughout Japan were examined to evaluate the treatment on visual function parameters, such as visual acuity, visual field, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and critical flicker frequency. OBSERVATIONS The methylprednisolone pulse treatment group showed faster recovery of visual function, particularly the visual acuity at 1 week (P<.05), Humphrey field analyzer mean deviation at 3 weeks (P<.05), and color vision at 1 week (P<.05). Recovery of contrast sensitivity at several different spatial frequencies was significant in the pulse treatment group at 1 (P<.01), 2 (P<.05), and 4 weeks (P<.05) after the start of treatment. Visual function test results at 12 weeks and 1 year were essentially the same in the two treatment groups. Side effects appeared more frequently in the pulse treatment group than in the control (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS Pulse treatment does not appear effective for idiopathic optic neuritis even though visual function in the pulse treatment group of this trial recovered more quickly during the initial phase compared to the controls. More effective and specific treatment should be established for optic neuritis.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,41,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0022430879,0
10360174,Mutations in human ARF exon 2 disrupt its nucleolar localization and impair its ability to block nuclear export of MDM2 and p53. The mammalian ARF-INK4a locus uniquely encodes two cell cycle inhibitors by using separate promoters and alternative reading frames. p16INK4a maintains the retinoblastoma protein in its growth suppressive state while ARF stabilizes p53. We report that human ARF protein predominantly localizes to the nucleolus via a sequence within the exon 2-encoded C-terminal domain and is induced to leave the nucleolus by MDM2. ARF forms nuclear bodies with MDM2 and p53 and blocks p53 and MDM2 nuclear export. Tumor-associated mutations in ARF exon 2 disrupt ARF's nucleolus localization and reduce ARF's ability to block p53 nuclear export and to stabilize p53. Our results suggest an ARF-regulated MDM2-dependent p53 stabilization and link the human tumor-associated mutations in ARF with a functional alteration.,MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,48,pos_MEDLINE,0.9785903,1
10368269,"Desulfovibrio desulfuricans iron hydrogenase: the structure shows unusual coordination to an active site Fe binuclear center. BACKGROUND Many microorganisms have the ability to either oxidize molecular hydrogen to generate reducing power or to produce hydrogen in order to remove low-potential electrons. These reactions are catalyzed by two unrelated enzymes: the Ni-Fe hydrogenases and the Fe-only hydrogenases. RESULTS We report here the structure of the heterodimeric Fe-only hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans - the first for this class of enzymes. With the exception of a ferredoxin-like domain, the structure represents a novel protein fold. The so-called H cluster of the enzyme is composed of a typical [4Fe-4S] cubane bridged to a binuclear active site Fe center containing putative CO and CN ligands and one bridging 1, 3-propanedithiol molecule. The conformation of the subunits can be explained by the evolutionary changes that have transformed monomeric cytoplasmic enzymes into dimeric periplasmic enzymes. Plausible electron- and proton-transfer pathways and a putative channel for the access of hydrogen to the active site have been identified. CONCLUSIONS The unrelated active sites of Ni-Fe and Fe-only hydrogenases have several common features: coordination of diatomic ligands to an Fe ion; a vacant coordination site on one of the metal ions representing a possible substrate-binding site; a thiolate-bridged binuclear center; and plausible proton- and electron-transfer pathways and substrate channels. The diatomic coordination to Fe ions makes them low spin and favors low redox states, which may be required for catalysis. Complex electron paramagnetic resonance signals typical of Fe-only hydrogenases arise from magnetic interactions between the [4Fe-4S] cluster and the active site binuclear center. The paucity of protein ligands to this center suggests that it was imported from the inorganic world as an already functional unit.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,50,pos_MEDLINE,0.99711037,1
10386995,"Glycosylation sites flank phosphorylation sites on synapsin I: O-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues are localized within domains mediating synapsin I interactions. Synapsin I is concentrated in nerve terminals, where it appears to anchor synaptic vesicles to the cytoskeleton and thereby ensures a steady supply of fusion-competent synaptic vesicles. Although phosphorylation-dependent binding of synapsin I to cytoskeletal elements and synaptic vesicles is well characterized, little is known about synapsin I's O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modifications. Here, we identified seven in vivo O-GlcNAcylation sites on synapsin I by analysis of HPLC-purified digests of rat brain synapsin I. The seven O-GlcNAcylation sites (Ser55, Thr56, Thr87, Ser516, Thr524, Thr562, and Ser576) in synapsin I are clustered around its five phosphorylation sites in domains B and D. The proximity of phosphorylation sites to O-GlcNAcylation sites in the regulatory domains of synapsin I suggests that O-GlcNAcylation may modulate phosphorylation and indirectly affect synapsin I interactions. With use of synthetic peptides, however, the presence of an O-GlcNAc at sites Thr562 and Ser576 resulted in only a 66% increase in the Km of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation of site Ser566 with no effect on its Vmax. We conclude that O-GlcNAcylation likely plays a more direct role in synapsin I interactions than simply modulating the protein's phosphorylation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,56,pos_MEDLINE,0.97991896,1

The inclusion of the VP2 capsid contributed to particle formation and stability. The adjuvant QS-21 significantly enhanced the immunogenicity of 2/6/7-VLPs over A10H or saline alone. Equivalent serum neutralizing antibody responses were induced over the range of 1-15 microg/dose of 2/6/7-VLPs administered with the range of 5-20 microg/dose of QS-21.

10398682,"Crystal structure of the conserved core of the herpes simplex virus transcriptional regulatory protein VP16. On infection, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) virion protein VP16 (Vmw65; alphaTIF) forms a transcriptional regulatory complex-the VP16-induced complex-with two cellular proteins, HCF and Oct-1, on VP16-responsive cis-regulatory elements in HSV immediate-early promoters called TAATGARAT. Comparison of different HSV VP16 sequences reveals a conserved core region that is sufficient for VP16-induced complex formation. The crystal structure of the VP16 core has been determined at 2.1 A resolution. The results reveal a novel, seat-like protein structure. Together with the activity of mutant VP16 proteins, the structure of free VP16 suggests that it contains (1) a disordered carboxy-terminal region that associates with HCF, Oct-1, and DNA in the VP16-induced complex, and (2) a structured region involved in virion assembly and possessing a novel DNA-binding surface that differentiates among TAATGARAT VP16-response elements.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,61,pos_MEDLINE,0.9977482,1

An immunochromatographic 1-step test for the detection of fecal occult blood was evaluated for applicability for the forensic identification of human blood in stained material. The following experiments were conducted: 1) determination of the sensitivity and specificity of the assay; 2) evaluation of different extraction media for bloodstains (sterile water, Tris buffer pH 7.5 provided in the test kit, 5% ammonia); 3) analysis of biological samples subjected to a variety of environmental insults; and 4) evaluation of casework samples. This immunochromatographic 1-step occult blood test is specific for human (primate) hemoglobin and is at least an order of magnitude more sensitive than previous methods for detecting human hemoglobin in bloodstains. The antigen is insensitive to a variety of environmental insults, except for exposure to certain detergents and household bleaches and prolonged exposure to certain preparations of luminol. The entire assay can be conducted in field testing conditions within minutes.

10430890,"Binding of elongin A or a von Hippel-Lindau peptide stabilizes the structure of yeast elongin C. Elongin is a heterotrimeric transcription elongation factor composed of subunits A, B, and C in mammals. Elongin A and C are F-box-containing and SKP1 homologue proteins, respectively, and are therefore of interest for their potential roles in cell cycle-dependent proteolysis. Mammalian elongin C interacts with both elongin A and elongin B, as well as with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein VHL. To investigate the corresponding interactions in yeast, we have utilized NMR spectroscopy combined with ultracentrifugal sedimentation experiments to examine complexes of yeast elongin C (Elc1) with yeast elongin A (Ela1) and two peptides from homologous regions of Ela1 and human VHL. Elc1 alone is a homotetramer composed of subunits with a structured N-terminal region and a dynamically unstable C-terminal region. Binding of a peptide fragment of the Elc1-interaction domain of Ela1 or with a homologous peptide from VHL promotes folding of the C-terminal region of Elc1 into two regular helical structures and dissociates Elc1 into homodimers. Moreover, analysis of the complex of Elc1 with the full Elc1-interaction domain of Ela1 reveals that the Elc1 homodimer is dissociated to preferentially form an Ela1/Elc1 heterodimer. Thus, elongin C is found to oligomerize in solution and to undergo significant structural rearrangements upon binding of two different partner proteins. These results suggest a structural basis for the interaction of an F-box-containing protein with a SKP1 homologue and the modulation of this interaction by the tumor suppressor VHL.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,73,pos_MEDLINE,0.9978677,1
10481074,"A GSK3-binding peptide from FRAT1 selectively inhibits the GSK3-catalysed phosphorylation of axin and beta-catenin. The Axin-dependent phosphorylation of beta-catenin catalysed by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is inhibited during embryogenesis. This protects beta-catenin against ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, leading to its accumulation in the nucleus, where it controls the expression of genes important for development. Frequently rearranged in advanced T-cell lymphomas 1 (FRAT1) is a mammalian homologue of a GSK3-binding protein (GBP), which appears to play a key role in the correct establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis in Xenopus laevis. Here, we demonstrate that FRATtide (a peptide corresponding to residues 188-226 of FRAT1) binds to GSK3 and prevents GSK3 from interacting with Axin. FRATtide also blocks the GSK3-catalysed phosphorylation of Axin and beta-catenin, suggesting a potential mechanism by which GBP could trigger axis formation. In contrast, FRATtide does not suppress GSK3 activity towards other substrates, such as glycogen synthase and eIF2B, whose phosphorylation is independent of Axin but dependent on a 'priming' phosphorylation. This may explain how the essential cellular functions of GSK3 can continue, despite the suppression of beta-catenin phosphorylation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,79,pos_MEDLINE,0.99373454,1

EPR spectrometry was used to investigate the effect of excretory/secretory product from Necator americanus on superoxide radical anions generated by xanthine/xanthine oxidase as a measure of excretory/secretory product superoxide dismutase activity. Using 1,1',5,5'-dimethylpyrollidine-N-oxide (DMPO) as a superoxide spin-trapping agent a 12-line EPR spectrum characteristic of the DMPO-OOH adduct was observed to decrease in the presence of excretory/secretory product. Superoxide dismutase activity was proportional to excretory/secretory protein concentration, was inhibited with cyanide treatment and was progressively destroyed with increasing time of heat denaturation of excretory/secretory product. Using a purpose-built chamber the superoxide dismutase activity of excretory/secretory product from live worms in culture was shown to accumulate with time to a maximum at 4 h. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum obtained for the frozen excretory/secretory product of N. americanus recorded at 77 K is typical of Cu(II) in a protein matrix.

BRCA1 is a susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian cancer with growth-inhibitory activity for which the mechanism of action remains unclear. When introduced into cells, BRCA1 inhibits growth of some but not all cell lines. In an attempt to uncover the mechanism of growth suppression by BRCA1, we examined a panel of cell lines for their ability to reduce colony outgrowth in response to BRCA1 overexpression. Of all variables tested, only those cells with wild-type pRb were sensitive to BRCA1-induced growth suppression. In cells with an intact rb gene, inactivation of pRb by HPV E7 abrogates the growth arrest imposed by BRCA1. In accordance with these observations, we found that BRCA1 could not suppress BrdUrd uptake in primary fibroblasts from rb-/- mice and exhibited an intermediate ability to inhibit DNA synthesis in rb+/- as compared with rb+/+ cells. We further found that the BRCA1 protein complexes with the hypophosphorylated form of pRb. This binding is localized to amino acids 304-394 of BRCA1 protein and requires the ABC domain of pRb. In-frame deletion of BRCA1 fragment involved in interaction with pRb completely abolished the growth-suppressive property of BRCA1. Although it has been reported that BRCA1 interacts with p53, we find the p53 status did not affect the ability of BRCA1 to suppress colony formation.

BACKGROUND/AIMS Mirizzi syndrome is a rare benign complication of long-standing cholelithiasis and neither diagnostic modality nor clinical feature has a 100% sensitivity and specificity. The objective of our study was to call attention to the importance of this rare syndrome with its miscellaneous treatments. METHODOLOGY Between January 1992 and June 1997, a total of 8 (4 females and 4 males) patients, who were operated and diagnosed as Mirizzi syndrome, were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS The mean age was 53.75 years. During the same time period 0.98% of the total 812 cholelithiasis patients were Mirizzi syndrome. The ultrasound was used in 7, computed tomography (CT) in 4 and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in 2 cases. Ultrasound allowed the detection of cholelithiasis in all, but proximal bile duct dilatation in only 71% of cases. CT detected the non-specific findings of syndrome in 75% of cases. In 2 patients, because of the difficulties due to the patients themselves and the technical management problems. ERCP could not detect the pathology properly. In 2 of 5 type I patients, we performed only cholecystectomy and in another 2 cholecystectomy plus T-tube drainage. In 1 case, due to major hepatic duct injury during surgery, cholecystectomy plus hepaticojejunostomy over the Y-stent was performed. Biliary fistula developed in 1 patient with T-tube drainage and was successfully managed with conservative treatment. In all type II patients we preferred cholecystectomy plus choledochoduodenostomy and all of them were free of complications. CONCLUSIONS If there is no question about the security of the common bile duct at surgery in type I patients, we recommended cholecystectomy, otherwise cholecystectomy plus exploration of common bile duct and/or drainage should be the procedure of choice.

Human Replication Protein A (hsRPA) is required for multiple cellular processes in DNA metabolism including DNA repair, replication and recombination. It binds single-stranded DNA with high affinity and interacts specifically with multiple proteins. hsRPA forms a heterotrimeric complex composed of 70-, 32- and 14-kDa subunits (henceforth RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14). The N-terminal 168 residues of RPA70 form a structurally distinct domain that stimulates DNA polymerase alpha activity, interacts with several transcriptional activators including tumor suppressor p53, and during the cell cycle it signals escape from the DNA damage induced G2/M checkpoint. We have solved the global fold of the fragment corresponding to this domain (RPA70 delta 169) and we find residues 8-108 of the N-terminal domain are structured. The remaining C-terminal residues are unstructured and may form a flexible linker to the DNA-binding domain of RPA70. The globular region forms a five-stranded anti-parallel beta-barrel. The ends of the barrel are capped by short helices. Two loops on one side of the barrel form a large basic cleft which is a likely site for binding the acidic motifs of transcriptional activators.

The primary purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which specific patient attitudes and beliefs about medical care and self-care for back pain predict future healthcare use. An automated database allowed examination of the predictive relationships in two primary care patient samples. In general, beliefs that physicians should find a definitive cause and permanent cure for back pain predicted neither physician visits nor prescription medication fills. Patient attitudes endorsing the benefits of medical treatment for back pain (as opposed to a permanent cure) predicted the use of these specific healthcare services. In a third sample of primary care back pain patients, we assessed whether a four-session self-care intervention modified those attitudes and beliefs shown to predict future healthcare use. The group intervention was associated with changes in attitudes about use of physician services but not medication use. A secondary purpose was to examine initial psychometric properties of a proposed back pain Self-Care Orientation Scale made up of the original 11 items. Factor analyses of the item set yielded three factors, but inconclusive results; the internal consistency of the identified sub-scales was only moderate. However, findings that a subset of items predicted physician visits and prescriptions medication fills, and was sensitive to change following a self-care intervention, suggest avenues for improving measurement of self-care orientation.

Heme-binding protein 23 kDa (HBP23), a rat isoform of human proliferation-associated gene product (PAG), is a member of the peroxiredoxin family of peroxidases, having two conserved cysteine residues. Recent biochemical studies have shown that HBP23/PAG is an oxidative stress-induced and proliferation-coupled multifunctional protein that exhibits specific bindings to c-Abl protein tyrosine kinase and heme, as well as a peroxidase activity. A 2.6-A resolution crystal structure of rat HBP23 in oxidized form revealed an unusual dimer structure in which the active residue Cys-52 forms a disulfide bond with conserved Cys-173 from another subunit by C-terminal tail swapping. The active site is largely hydrophobic with partially exposed Cys-173, suggesting a reduction mechanism of oxidized HBP23 by thioredoxin. Thus, the unusual cysteine disulfide bond is involved in peroxidation catalysis by using thioredoxin as the source of reducing equivalents. The structure also provides a clue to possible interaction surfaces for c-Abl and heme.

As a result of this case, and a review of the literature to gain further knowledge of anatomical variations, it is advised that more attention should be paid clinically to this artery to prevent its injury.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,106,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0043823365,0
10671930,"Prolonged ambulatory recording of antroduodenal motility in slow-transit constipation. BACKGROUND Slow-transit constipation may be part of a pan-enteric motor disorder. To test this hypothesis 24-h ambulatory antroduodenal manometry was performed and orocaecal transit time determined in patients with slow-transit constipation and in healthy controls. METHODS Antroduodenal motility was recorded with a five-channel solid-state catheter. Postprandial motility was recorded after consumption of two standardized test meals and interdigestive motility was recorded nocturnally. Manometry tracings were analysed for quantitative and qualitative abnormalities. Orocaecal transit time was determined by means of the lactulose hydrogen breath test. RESULTS Postprandial motility was no different between patients and controls. However, some minor changes of interdigestive motility were observed. The proportion of phase II activity of the nocturnal cycles of the interdigestive migrating motor complex was increased in patients while phase I activity was decreased. The total number of observed phase III fronts was no different in patients and controls, although the number of phase III fronts with antral onset was decreased. Furthermore, the amplitude of phase III activity of duodenal onset was also decreased. Specific motor abnormalities such as retrograde propagation of phase III fronts were more frequent in patients. Orocaecal transit time was delayed in patients. CONCLUSION In patients with slow-transit constipation, orocaecal transit time is delayed but antro- duodenal motility is generally well preserved with only minor alterations.

10673432,"Structural and kinetic analysis of Escherichia coli GDP-mannose 4,6 dehydratase provides insights into the enzyme's catalytic mechanism and regulation by GDP-fucose. BACKGROUND GDP-mannose 4,6 dehydratase (GMD) catalyzes the conversion of GDP-(D)-mannose to GDP-4-keto, 6-deoxy-(D)-mannose. This is the first and regulatory step in the de novo biosynthesis of GDP-(L)-fucose. Fucose forms part of a number of glycoconjugates, including the ABO blood groups and the selectin ligand sialyl Lewis X. Defects in GDP-fucose metabolism have been linked to leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (LADII). RESULTS The structure of the GDP-mannose 4,6 dehydratase apo enzyme has been determined and refined using data to 2.3 A resolution. GMD is a homodimeric protein with each monomer composed of two domains. The larger N-terminal domain binds the NADP(H) cofactor in a classical Rossmann fold and the C-terminal domain harbors the sugar-nucleotide binding site. We have determined the GMD dissociation constants for NADP, NADPH and GDP-mannose. Each GMD monomer binds one cofactor and one substrate molecule, suggesting that both subunits are catalytically competent. GDP-fucose acts as a competitive inhibitor, suggesting that it binds to the same site as GDP-mannose, providing a mechanism for the feedback inhibition of fucose biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS The X-ray structure of GMD reveals that it is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family of proteins. We have modeled the binding of NADP and GDP-mannose to the enzyme and mutated four of the active-site residues to determine their function. The combined modeling and mutagenesis data suggests that at position 133 threonine substitutes serine as part of the serine-tyrosine-lysine catalytic triad common to the SDR family and Glu 135 functions as an active-site base.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,132,pos_MEDLINE,0.9976311,1

The laminins are large heterotrimeric glycoproteins with fundamental roles in basement membrane architecture and function. The C-terminus of the laminin alpha chain contains a tandem of five laminin G-like (LG) domains. We report the 2.0 A crystal structure of the laminin alpha2 LG4-LG5 domain pair, which harbours binding sites for heparin and the cell surface receptor alpha-dystroglycan, and is 41% identical to the laminin alpha1 E3 fragment. LG4 and LG5 are arranged in a V-shaped fashion related by a 110 degrees rotation about an axis passing near the domain termini. An extended N-terminal segment is disulfide bonded to LG5 and stabilizes the domain pair. Two calcium ions, one each in LG4 and LG5, are located 65 A apart at the tips of the domains opposite the polypeptide termini. An extensive basic surface region between the calcium sites is proposed to bind alpha-dystroglycan and heparin.

10761586,"Life systems of polyphagous arthropod pests in temporally unstable cropping systems. Annual cropping systems consist of a shifting mosaic of habitats that vary through time in their availability and suitability to insect pests. Agroecosystem instability results from changes that occur within a season with crop planting, development, and harvest. Further instability results from continuous alterations in biotic and abiotic insect life system components and from agricultural inputs. Changes to agroecosystems occur across seasons with changing agricultural practices, changing cropping patterns, and technological innovations. Much of this instability is a result of events unconnected with pest management. The abilities of polyphagous pest species to move among and utilize different habitat patches in response to changes in suitability enable the pests to exploit unstable cropping systems. These pest characteristics determine the location and timing of damaging populations. Habitat suitability is influenced by plant species and cultivar, crop phenology, and agricultural inputs. Pest movement is affected by a suite of intrinsic factors, such as population age structure and mobility, and extrinsic factors, including weather systems and habitat distribution. The life systems of three selected polyphagous pests are presented to demonstrate how an understanding of such systems in agricultural ecosystems improves our ability to predict and hence manage these populations.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,156,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.002364263,0

The membrane domain of OmpA consists of an eight-stranded all-next-neighbor antiparallel beta-barrel with short turns at the periplasmic barrel end and long flexible loops at the external end. The structure analysis has been extended from medium resolution to 1. 65 A (1 A=0.1 nm), and the molecular model has been refined anisotropically to show oriented mobilities of the structural elements. The improved data allowed us to locate five further detergent molecules and 11 more water molecules. Moreover, the two large non-polar packing contacts have now been defined in detail. The analysis indicates that the beta-barrel constitutes a solid scaffold such that the long external loops need not contribute to stability. These loops are highly mobile and thus cause a major problem during the crystallization process. The beta-barrel was related to those of lipocalins.

10805776,"Assembly of tau protein into Alzheimer paired helical filaments depends on a local sequence motif ((306)VQIVYK(311)) forming beta structure. We have searched for a minimal interaction motif in tau protein that supports the aggregation into Alzheimer-like paired helical filaments. Digestion of the repeat domain with different proteases yields a GluC-induced fragment comprising 43 residues (termed PHF43), which represents the third repeat of tau plus some flanking residues. This fragment self assembles readily into thin filaments without a paired helical appearance, but these filaments are highly competent to nucleate bona fide PHFs from full-length tau. Probing the interactions of PHF43 with overlapping peptides derived from the full tau sequence yields a minimal hexapeptide interaction motif of (306)VQIVYK(311) at the beginning of the third internal repeat. This motif coincides with the highest predicted beta-structure potential in tau. CD and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shows that PHF43 acquires pronounced beta structure in conditions of self assembly. Point mutations in the hexapeptide region by proline-scanning mutagenesis prevent the aggregation. The data indicate that PHF assembly is initiated by a short fragment containing the minimal interaction motif forming a local beta structure embedded in a largely random-coil protein.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,167,pos_MEDLINE,0.9928786,1

Here we demonstrate that in the absence of DNA damage, a portion of p95 and MRE11 is concentrated in PML nuclear bodies (NBs); MRE11 localization to the NBs is p95-dependent. In mammalian meiocytes, these proteins are specifically found at the telomeres.

10814926,"Retrograde perfusion and true reverse brain blood flow in humans. OBJECTIVE Reversal of brain blood flow is necessary for retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) to have any metabolic benefit, but RCP is commonly used with little clinical evidence of the true incidence of reverse brain blood flow and impact. S-100B is exclusive to the brain and spinal cord and released during hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA). True reverse brain blood flow (tRBBF) during RCP may be determined by demonstrating an excess of S-100B in the effluent blood from the common carotid artery compared to blood entering the brain. METHODS Simultaneous blood samples were drawn from the jugular bulb and left common carotid artery during RCP at 5 min intervals in ten patients undergoing aortic surgery, utilizing HCA and subjected to blood gas, glucose and S-100B quantification. RCP was instituted at maximum pressure of 25 mmHg. Trans-cranial Doppler (TCD) continuously monitored the middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAV). RESULTS The mean HCA and RCP durations were 31 min (20-50 min). Reversal of MCAV was demonstrated in only 6/10 cases (mean, 6 cm/s). Veno-arterial (V-A) extraction of oxygen and glucose occurred in all cases (P<0.001), with the mean effluent pO(2) falling to 14 mmHg. V-A S-100 gradients greater than 5% were demonstrated in 8/10 cases and correlated with higher oxygen extraction (P<0.01). In patients with and without MCAV reversal, the S-100 gradients were 1. 7 and 0.3 micromol/l, respectively (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS tRBBF occurred in nearly all patients. MCAV reversal appears to be a specific but insensitive guide to reverse perfusion. The de-saturation of effluent blood is not a reliable guide to true brain perfusion, and despite RCP, the brain remains ischaemic.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,169,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0024014052,0
10839544,"Functional link between ataxia-telangiectasia and Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene products. Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) are recessive genetic disorders with susceptibility to cancer and similar cellular phenotypes. The protein product of the gene responsible for A-T, designated ATM, is a member of a family of kinases characterized by a carboxy-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like domain. The NBS1 protein is specifically mutated in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome and forms a complex with the DNA repair proteins Rad50 and Mrel1. Here we show that phosphorylation of NBS1, induced by ionizing radiation, requires catalytically active ATM. Complexes containing ATM and NBS1 exist in vivo in both untreated cells and cells treated with ionizing radiation. We have identified two residues of NBS1, Ser 278 and Ser 343 that are phosphorylated in vitro by ATM and whose modification in vivo is essential for the cellular response to DNA damage. This response includes S-phase checkpoint activation, formation of the NBS1/Mrel1/Rad50 nuclear foci and rescue of hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation.

10856256,"Structure of tandem RNA recognition motifs from polypyrimidine tract binding protein reveals novel features of the RRM fold. Polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB), an RNA binding protein containing four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), is involved in both pre-mRNA splicing and translation initiation directed by picornaviral internal ribosome entry sites. Sequence comparisons previously indicated that PTB is a non-canonical RRM protein. The solution structure of a PTB fragment containing RRMs 3 and 4 shows that the protein consists of two domains connected by a long, flexible linker. The two domains tumble independently in solution, having no fixed relative orientation. In addition to the betaalphabetabetaalphabeta topology, which is characteristic of RRM domains, the C-terminal extension of PTB RRM-3 incorporates an unanticipated fifth beta-strand, which extends the RNA binding surface. The long, disordered polypeptide connecting beta4 and beta5 in RRM-3 is poised above the RNA binding surface and is likely to contribute to RNA recognition.

BACKGROUND Peptide inhibitors of caspases have helped define the role of these cysteine proteases in biology. Structural and biochemical characterization of the caspase enzymes may contribute to the development of new drugs for the treatment of caspase-mediated inflammation and apoptosis. RESULTS The crystal structure of the previously unpublished caspase-7 (Csp7; 2.35 A) bound to the reversible tetrapeptide aldehyde inhibitor acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO is compared with crystal structures of caspases-1 (2.3 A), -3 (2.2 A), and -8 (2.65 A) bound to the same inhibitor. Csp7 is a close homolog of caspase-3 (Csp3), and these two caspases possess some quarternary structural characteristics that support their unique role among the caspase family. However, although Csp3 and Csp7 are quite similar overall, they were found to have a significantly different substitution pattern of amino acids in and around the S4-binding site. CONCLUSIONS These structures span all three caspase subgroups, and provide a basis for inferring substrate and inhibitor binding, as well as selectivity for the entire caspase family.

The eukaryotic acidic P1 and P2 proteins modulate the activity of the ribosomal stalk but playing distinct roles. The aim of this work was to analyze the structural features that are behind their different function. A structural characterization of Saccharomyces cerevisaie P1 alpha and P2 beta proteins was performed by circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance, fluorescence spectroscopy, thermal denaturation, and protease sensitivity. The results confirm the low structure present in both proteins but reveal clear differences between them. P1 alpha shows a virtually unordered secondary structure with a residual helical content that disappears below 30 degrees C and a clear tendency to acquire secondary structure at low pH and in the presence of trifluoroethanol. In agreement with this higher disorder P1 alpha has a fully solvent-accessible tryptophan residue and, in contrast to P2 beta, is highly sensitive to protease degradation. An interaction between both proteins was observed, which induces an increase in the global secondary structure content of both proteins. Moreover, mixing of both proteins causes a shift of the P1 alpha tryptophan 40 signal, pointing to an involvement of this region in the interaction. This evidence directly proves an interaction between P1 alpha and P2 beta before ribosome binding and suggests a functional complementation between them. On a whole, the results provide structural support for the different functional roles played by the proteins of the two groups showing, at the same time, that relatively small structural differences between the two stalk acidic protein types can result in significant functional changes.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,199,pos_MEDLINE,0.99632156,1

A total inhibition of immunofluorescence could not be obtained using the technique of preincubating either anti-vasopressin or anti-oxytocin plasmas with their homologous antigens. An alternative test of specificity was therefore developed. Lysine-vasopressin (LVP), arginine-vasopressin (AVP) or oxytocin were covalently bound to CNB-activated agarose beads. These hormone-coupled beads were then either placed immediately on glass slides and treated in the same way as tissue sections for immunofluorescence, or pre-incubated in test-tubes with the antibodies and then prepared for immunofluorescence. Fluorescence was measured quantitatively using a Leitz orthoplan microscope with epi-illumination and a photometer attachment. Without pre-incubation the anti-oxytocin plasmas produced intensive fluorescence on those beads containing their homologous antigen (oxytocin) but only slight fluorescence with the heterologous antigens (AVP or LVP). Anti-vasopressin plasmas produced intensive fluorescence of AVP-, LVP- and oxytocin-containing beads. Because the neurohypophysial hormones were bound to agarose beads, antibodies binding to these hormones could be removed by simple centrifugation. Anti-oxytocin and anti-vasopressin lost their fluorescence capacity after pre-incubation with oxytocin- or vasopressin-containing beads respectively, showing that all the antibodies important for fluorescence were bound to homologous antigens. Pre-incubation of anti-oxytocin or anti-vasopressin with beads coupled to their heterologous hormones completely removed the components binding to the heterologous hormone, leaving antibodies that showed fluorescence only with oxytocin or vasopressin respectively. This purification showed that in contrast to the findings with homologous antigens, not all of the antibody population bound to its heterologous antigen. Using non-purified anti-vasopressin, immunofluorescence was observed in neurohypophyses of homozygous Brattleboro rats. This was evidently due to those antibodies which bind to oxytocin, since the fluorescence was abolished after pre-incubating the antibody-containing plasmas with oxytocin-coupled beads. Immunofluorescence was still observed, however, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of both Wistar and heterozygous Brattleboro rats, if purified anti-vasopressin was used. This was probably due to either vasopressin storage or production in these hypothalamic cells.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,222,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.004886375,0

Erythropoiesis occurs in two stages: proliferation amplifies cell number, and differentiation stimulates the acquisition of the functional properties of red blood cells. The erythroid colony-forming unit (CFU-E) amplifies the differentiation process in response to erythropoietic stress in vitro, whereas the burst-forming unit (BFU-E), which is not particularly sensitive to erythropoietin stimulation, gives rise to the CFU-E and, when stimulated, produces morphologically-identifiable erythroid colonies. The aim of this work was to evaluate the toxic effects of the antiviral agent, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), the antidiabetic drug, chlorpropamide (CLP), and the heme-analogous compound, protophorphirin IX zinc (II) (ZnPP), on the proliferation of erythroblastic progenitors by using human umbilical-cord blood cells and murine progenitors from long-term bone marrow cultures. All these agents may interfere with the hemopoietic process, causing myelotoxicity as an adverse effect via different mechanisms.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) plays a pivotal role in embryogenesis, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. HIF1alpha-mediated transcription requires the coactivator p300, at least in part, through interaction with the cysteine- and histidine-rich 1 domain of p300. To understand the molecular basis of this interaction, we have developed a random mutagenesis screen in yeast approach for efficient identification of residues that are functionally critical for protein interactions. As a result, four residues (Leu-795, Cys-800, Leu-818, and Leu-822) in the C-terminal activation domain of HIF1alpha have been identified as crucial for HIF1 transactivation in mammalian systems. Moreover, data from residue substitution experiments indicate the stringent necessity of leucine and hydrophobic cysteine for C-terminal activation domain function. Likewise, Leu-344, Leu-345, Cys-388, and Cys-393 in the cysteine- and histidine-rich 1 domain of p300 have also been shown to be essential for the functional interaction.

Heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and NOE back-calculation made possible the sequential assignment of the 86 spin systems. Consequently, 915 NMR restraints were identified and 272 of them turned out to be long range ([i-j] > 4), providing structural information on the whole Tat protein. The poor spectral dispersion of Tat NMR spectra does not allow an accurate structure to be determined as for other proteins studied by 2D NMR. Nevertheless, we were able to determine the folding for Tat protein at a 1-mM protein concentration in a 100 mM, pH 4.5 phosphate buffer. The two main Tat functional regions, the basic region and the cysteine-rich region, are well exposed to solvent while a part of the N-terminal region and the C-terminal region constitute the core of Tat Bru.

11121423,"The cadherin cytoplasmic domain is unstructured in the absence of beta-catenin. A possible mechanism for regulating cadherin turnover. Cadherins are single pass transmembrane proteins that mediate Ca(2+)-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion by linking the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells. In adherens junctions, the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins bind to beta-catenin, which in turn binds to the actin-associated protein alpha-catenin. The physical properties of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain and its interactions with beta-catenin have been investigated. Proteolytic sensitivity, tryptophan fluorescence, circular dichroism, and (1)H NMR measurements indicate that murine E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain is unstructured. Upon binding to beta-catenin, the domain becomes resistant to proteolysis, suggesting that it structures upon binding. Cadherin-beta-catenin complex stability is modestly dependent on ionic strength, indicating that, contrary to previous proposals, the interaction is not dominated by electrostatics. Comparison of 18 cadherin sequences indicates that their cytoplasmic domains are unlikely to be structured in isolation. This analysis also reveals the presence of PEST sequences, motifs associated with ubiquitin/proteosome degradation, that overlap the previously identified beta-catenin-binding site. It is proposed that binding of cadherins to beta-catenin prevents recognition of degradation signals that are exposed in the unstructured cadherin cytoplasmic domain, favoring a cell surface population of catenin-bound cadherins capable of participating in cell adhesion.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,257,pos_MEDLINE,0.9977349,1
11160276,"Signals that initiate somatic hypermutation of B cells in vitro. Somatic hypermutation is initiated as B lymphocytes proliferate in germinal centers. The signals that switch on the mutation process are unknown. We have derived an in vitro system to define signals that will initiate mutation in normal, naive splenic B cells. We find that three signals are required to allow detection of somatic mutation in vitro; these are anti-Ig, anti-CD40, and anti-CD38. If any one of these is omitted, mutation remains off. We show that CD40 is obligatory in vivo, as CD40 knockout mice exhibit no Ag-driven mutation. In contrast, CD38 is not, as CD38 knockout mice mutate normally. We believe that, in vitro, CD38, in combination with other stimuli, drives extensive cell division, allowing the detection of mutated sequences. However, in germinal centers in vivo, proliferative activity is instigated by a different molecule. This is the first demonstration of the initiation of hypermutation in vitro with normal splenic B cells using defined stimuli.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,263,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0077255345,0
11328809,"Crystal structure of the mitotic spindle kinesin Eg5 reveals a novel conformation of the neck-linker. Success of mitosis depends upon the coordinated and regulated activity of many cellular factors, including kinesin motor proteins, which are required for the assembly and function of the mitotic spindle. Eg5 is a kinesin implicated in the formation of the bipolar spindle and its movement prior to and during anaphase. We have determined the crystal structure of the Eg5 motor domain with ADP-Mg bound. This structure revealed a new intramolecular binding site of the neck-linker. In other kinesins, the neck-linker has been shown to be a critical mechanical element for force generation. The neck-linker of conventional kinesin is believed to undergo an ordered-to-disordered transition as it translocates along a microtubule. The structure of Eg5 showed an ordered neck-linker conformation in a position never observed previously. The docking of the neck-linker relies upon residues conserved only in the Eg5 subfamily of kinesin motors. Based on this new information, we suggest that the neck-linker of Eg5 may undergo an ordered-to-ordered transition during force production. This ratchet-like mechanism is consistent with the biological activity of Eg5.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,308,pos_MEDLINE,0.9979292,1
11371188,"Molecular shapes of transcription factors TFIIB and VP16 in solution: implications for recognition. The molecular shapes of transcription factors TFIIB and VP16 have been studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We interpret the shapes and discuss the implications for the specific recruitment of these proteins into regulatory assemblies. Human transcription factor TFIIB, a universal component of the transcription preinitiation complex, has a triangular form resulting from intramolecular associations between its two principal structural domains. A segment linking the two domains appears to be conformationally flexible. The solution shape of TFIIB can be well fitted with the crystal structure of the DNA-bound C-terminal domain together with the NMR structure of the N-terminal domain; however, the shape cannot accommodate the NMR structure of the isolated C-terminal domain. We discuss how the conformational differences between the solution structures of the isolated C-terminal domain and the intact protein might result from interdomain allostery. Docking the SAXS shape of intact TFIIB into the preinitiation complex suggests that the flexible linker region may contact the 3' flanking region of the TATA element in the major groove. Transcription rates can be enhanced by activator proteins, and the classical example is the herpes simplex virus factor VP16 (alpha-TIF), which associates with cellular transcription factors, including TFIIB. The shape reconstruction of VP16 from its SAXS profile reveals a globular structural core that can be well modeled by the crystal structure of a conserved, central region of the protein. However, the carboxy terminus extends from this core and is essentially disordered. As it makes defined protein-protein interactions in the activation complex, the flexible segment is likely to condense upon assembly with its partners.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,318,pos_MEDLINE,0.9975656,1

Apoptotic DNA fragmentation is mediated by a caspase-activated DNA fragmentation factor (DFF)40. Expression and folding of DFF40 require the presence of DFF45, which also acts as a nuclease inhibitor before DFF40 activation by execution caspases. The N-terminal domains (NTDs) of both proteins are homologous, and their interaction plays a key role in the proper functioning of this two-component system. Here we report that the NTD of DFF45 alone is unstructured in solution, and its folding is induced upon binding to DFF40 NTD. Therefore, folding of both proteins regulates the formation of the DFF40/DFF45 complex. The solution structure of the heterodimeric complex between NTDs of DFF40 and DFF45 reported here shows that the mutual chaperoning includes the formation of an extensive network of intermolecular interactions that bury a hydrophobic cluster inside the interface, surrounded by intermolecular salt bridges.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,319,pos_MEDLINE,0.9980122,1

Pteridine reductase (PTR1) is a short-chain reductase (SDR) responsible for the salvage of pterins in parasitic trypanosomatids. PTR1 catalyzes the NADPH-dependent two-step reduction of oxidized pterins to the active tetrahydro-forms and reduces susceptibility to antifolates by alleviating dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibition. Crystal structures of PTR1 complexed with cofactor and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (DHB) or methotrexate (MTX) delineate the enzyme mechanism, broad spectrum of activity and inhibition by substrate or an antifolate. PTR1 applies two distinct reductive mechanisms to substrates bound in one orientation. The first reduction uses the generic SDR mechanism, whereas the second shares similarities with the mechanism proposed for DHFR.

Although a functional role in copper binding has been suggested for the prion protein, evidence for binding at affinities characteristic of authentic metal-binding proteins has been lacking. By presentation of copper(II) ions in the presence of the weak chelator glycine, we have now characterized two high-affinity binding sites for divalent transition metals within the human prion protein. One is in the N-terminal octapeptide-repeat segment and has a K(d) for copper(II) of 10(-14) M, with other metals (Ni(2+), Zn(2+), and Mn(2+)) binding three or more orders of magnitude more weakly. However, NMR and fluorescence data reveal a previously unreported second site around histidines 96 and 111, a region of the molecule known to be crucial for prion propagation. The K(d) for copper(II) at this site is 4 x 10(-14) M, whereas nickel(II), zinc(II), and manganese(II) bind 6, 7, and 10 orders of magnitude more weakly, respectively, regardless of whether the protein is in its oxidized alpha-helical (alpha-PrP) or reduced beta-sheet (beta-PrP) conformation.

11514675,"Site-directed mutations of human hemoglobin at residue 35beta: a residue at the intersection of the alpha1beta1, alpha1beta2, and alpha1alpha2 interfaces. Because Tyr35beta is located at the convergence of the alpha1beta1, alpha1beta2, and alpha1alpha2 interfaces in deoxyhemoglobin, it can be argued that mutations at this position may result in large changes in the functional properties of hemoglobin. However, only small mutation-induced changes in functional and structural properties are found for the recombinant hemoglobins betaY35F and betaY35A. Oxygen equilibrium-binding studies in solution, which measure the overall oxygen affinity (the p50) and the overall cooperativity (the Hill coefficient) of a hemoglobin solution, show that removing the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr35beta results in small decreases in oxygen affinity and cooperativity. In contrast, removing the entire phenolic ring results in a fourfold increase in oxygen affinity and no significant change in cooperativity. The kinetics of carbon monoxide (CO) combination in solution and the oxygen-binding properties of these variants in deoxy crystals, which measure the oxygen affinity and cooperativity of just the T quaternary structure, show that the ligand affinity of the T quaternary structure decreases in betaY35F and increases in betaY35A. The kinetics of CO rebinding following flash photolysis, which provides a measure of the dissociation of the liganded hemoglobin tetramer, indicates that the stability of the liganded hemoglobin tetramer is not altered in betaY35F or betaY35A. X-ray crystal structures of deoxy betaY35F and betaY35A are highly isomorphous with the structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin. The betaY35F mutation repositions the carboxyl group of Asp126alpha1 so that it may form a more favorable interaction with the guanidinium group of Arg141alpha2. The betaY35A mutation results in increased mobility of the Arg141alpha side chain, implying that the interactions between Asp126alpha1 and Arg141alpha2 are weakened. Therefore, the changes in the functional properties of these 35beta mutants appear to correlate with subtle structural differences at the C terminus of the alpha-subunit.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,349,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.98024315,1
11526233,"Structure of the yeast ribonucleotide reductase Y2Y4 heterodimer. The R2 subunits of class I ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) house a diferric-tyrosyl radical (Y*) cofactor essential for DNA synthesis. In yeast, there are two R2 proteins, Y2 and Y4. Although both Y2 and Y4 are homologous to R2s from other organisms, Y4 lacks three conserved iron-binding residues, and its exact function is unclear. Y4 is required for assembly of the diferric-Y* cofactor in Y2, and the two proteins can form both homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes. The Y2Y4 heterodimer was crystallized from a mixture of the two proteins, and its structure was determined to 2.8 A resolution. Both Y2 and Y4 are completely alpha helical and resemble the mouse and Escherichia coli R2s in overall fold. Three alpha helices not observed in the mouse R2 structure are present at the Y2 N terminus, and one extra N-terminal helix is observed in Y4. In addition, one of the eight principal helices in both Y2 and Y4, alphaD, is shifted significantly from its position in mouse R2. The heterodimer interface is similar to the mouse R2 homodimer interface in size and interacting residues, but loop regions at the interface edges differ. A single metal ion, assigned as Zn(II), occupies the Fe2 position in the Y2 active site. Treatment of the crystals with Fe(II) results in difference electron density consistent with formation of a diiron center. No metal-binding site is observed in Y4.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) allows the direct localization of DANN and RNA sequences on chromosomes, in cells and in tissue. The technique is based on hybridization between target sequences of single-strand DNA of chromosomes or cell nuclei with marked complementary specimens. The signal is amplified using fluorochrome-marked specific antibodies and made visible under a microscope. Signals from painted chromosomes, stained subchromosomal regions or localized single probes are generally visible when an epifluorescence microsope is used. In order to view and display different fluorochromes, single filter sets, as well as double and triple bandpass filters, are in use. For multiple fluoroscence imaging, lenses with high numerical aperture, mostly oil immersion systems, are recommended. In conventional photomicrography, triple exposure on high-speed film (e.g., 400-1,000 ASA) is more or less the limitation. Opto=electronic methods using a CCD and laser summing techniques have considerably extended the application range of multiple fluorescence techniques. By means of digitized images, simultaneous detection of multiple-labelled objects and ratio imaging up to 24 colors are possible today.

11535617,"The nucleoporin Nup60p functions as a Gsp1p-GTP-sensitive tether for Nup2p at the nuclear pore complex. INTRODUCTION. The translocation of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytosol of eukaryotic cells occurs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC)* and is facilitated by karyopherins (Kaps, importins, exportins, or transportins) (Gorlich and Kutay, 1999). Members of the karyopherin β family of proteins bind the nuclear import or export signals of molecules that need transport (herein referred to as cargo) and accomplish deposition of their cargo at the opposite side of the NPC via interactions with multiple proteins of the NPC (nucleoporins [Nups]). Nups that contain FG peptide repeats (FG Nups) are proposed to function as binding sites for karyopherins within the NPC, and translocation may proceed by the repeated association and dissociation of karyopherins with FG Nups strategically located throughout the NPC (Radu et al., 1995; Rexach and Blobel, 1995). Despite this and other models that attempt to explain the translocation process, the actual mechanisms of karyopherin movement within the NPC remain a mystery. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 30 distinct Nups interact in multiple copies to form an NPC (Rout et al., 2000). Yeast NPCs are shaped as an octagonal ring measuring 95-nm in diameter and 35-nm in depth (Yang et al., 1998). A subset of Nups form filaments that extend into the cytoplasm and a different subset form a basket structure that extends into the nucleoplasm. All other Nups are distributed symmetrically about a central axis in the NPC (Rout et al., 2000), forming a ringed scaffold with spokes and a central transporter that serves as the conduit for macromolecular transport (Yang et al., 1998). The nuclear basket structure and the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC contain Nups that are proposed to function in the initiation and termination of karyopherin-mediated transport reactions (Shah and Forbes, 1998; Kehlenbach et al., 1999; Ullman et al., 1999; Yaseen and Blobel, 1999). Nup60p, Nup2p, and Nup1p form part of the nuclear basket structure of the yeast NPC. Nup60p and Nup1p are the only two Nups in S. cerevisiae that localize exclusively to the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC (Rout et al., 2000). A third Nup, Nup2p, is tethered to the nucleoplasmic side (Hood et al., 2000; Solsbacher et al., 2000), but is also present in the nucleoplasm (Loeb et al., 1993). Nup60p was identified recently (Rout et al., 2000) and there is little information about its function. Nup2p and Nup1p are well characterized and share redundant functions, as nup2Δ and some nup1Δ yeast strains are viable but nup2Δ nup1Δ double-knockout strains are nonviable (Loeb et al., 1993). Nup2p and Nup1p contain 16 and 23 FxFG peptide repeats, respectively (Davis and Fink, 1990; Loeb et al., 1993), which serve as docking sites for Kap95p–Kap60p heterodimers (karyopherin αβ or importin αβ) in vitro (Belanger et al., 1994; Rexach and Blobel, 1995; Solsbacher et al., 2000; Allen et al., 2001). Nup2p and Nup1p also interact with other karyopherin βs, such as Msn5p, Nmd5p, Kap121p, and Kap122p (Ryan and Wente, 2000). In addition to being docking sites for karyopherin βs, Nup2p and Nup1p also bind Kap60p (Srp1p) monomers directly (Floer et al., 1997; Booth et al., 1999; Solsbacher et al., 2000) and facilitate Cse1p-dependent export of Kap60p from the nucleus (Booth et al., 1999; Hood et al., 2000; Solsbacher et al., 2000). Nup2p may also have an ancillary role in nuclear export of tRNA as it interacts with Los1p, the exportin for tRNA (Hellmuth et al., 1998). Finally, Nup2p contains a COOH-terminal domain that binds Gsp1p, the yeast homologue of the Ran GTPase (Dingwall et al., 1995). Gsp1p is a ras-like guanine nucleotide binding protein that governs the interaction of karyopherin βs (importins and exportins) with their cargoes and Nups (Nakielny and Dreyfuss, 1999; Allen et al., 2001). Upon binding importins, Gsp1p–GTP disrupts their interaction with cargo and Nups, thereby terminating import reactions. Conversely, Gsp1p–GTP binding to exportins enhances their binding to cargo and Nups, serving to initiate export reactions. Not surprisingly, maintenance of a Gsp1p–GTP gradient across the nuclear envelope is crucial for nuclear transport reactions and cell survival. The sequestration of Prp20p (a Gsp1p guanine nucleotide exchange factor [GEF]) and Rna1p (a Gsp1p GTPase activating protein [GAP]) to the yeast nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, respectively, likely generates a Gsp1p–GTP gradient where the concentration of Gsp1p–GTP is high in the nucleus and low in the cytoplasm. Here we characterize the function of Nup60p: (a) as a Gsp1p–GTP-sensitive tether for Nup2p at the NPC; (b) as a regulator of Prp20p function; (c) as a novel Gsp1p binding protein; (d) as a docking site for Kap123p and Kap95p–Kap60p heterodimers; and (e) as a platform for the assembly and departure of Kap60p–Cse1p–Gsp1p–GTP export complexes from the nucleus. Most interestingly, we find that Gsp1p–GTP enhances the interaction between Nup60p and Nup2p 10-fold, possibly forming a bridge between the two Nups. Molecular mechanisms are described for the dynamic assembly and disassembly of Nup60p–Nup2p complexes and the in vivo role of Nup60p in nuclear import and export reactions. RESULTS. IDENTIFICATION OF KAP95P BINDING PROTEINS. As part of our ongoing effort to characterize the mechanism of Kap95p–Kap60p-mediated transport across the NPC, we isolated and identified Kap95p (karyopherin/importin β) binding proteins from yeast extracts. Kap95p is the yeast homologue of vertebrate karyopherin β1/importin β (Enenkel et al., 1995). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)–Kap95p was immobilized on glutathione-coated Sepharose beads (beads) and added to yeast extracts to capture interacting proteins. After washing the beads, bound proteins were eluted with 250 mM MgCl2, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and identified using mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF and LC-MS). The most abundant proteins bound to Kap95p were identified as Nup1p, Nup2p, and Kap60p (Fig. 1 A); this was not surprising a",PMC,pos,1,pos,354,pos_PMC,0.9907499,1

BACKGROUND Recent histological evidence has documented that grafted palatal connective tissue is capable of forming a new attachment to previously exposed roots in the treatment of gingival recession. No clinical studies have tested the ability of connective tissue that has been implanted beneath the periosteum into periodontal osseous defects to reduce probing depth and increase clinical attachment levels. This study reports the long-term clinical effect of subperiosteal and intraosseous connective tissue grafts on deep periodontal pockets. METHODS Connective tissue (CT) grafts were placed in 32 periodontal pockets on 27 patients. Grafts were classified into 3 groups. Type I grafts had 50% or more vascular surface contact and were < or = 2.5 mm thick. Type II grafts had 50% or more contact but were > 2.5 mm thick, and Type III grafts had less than 50% vascular contact regardless of thickness. Twelve of 14 Type I sites, 9 of 15 Type II sites, and 3 of 3 Type III sites were analyzed 9 to 13 years following treatment. RESULTS Clinical attachment level change differed significantly between the graft types on survivor teeth (P < 0.05): Type III had 2 mm loss (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4 to 3.6), while Type II and Type I grafts had a 2.7 mm gain (95% CI: 2.0 to 3.4) and 4.3 mm gain (95% CI: 3.3 to 5.2), respectively.

We previously showed that alternatively spliced ankyrins-G, the Ank3 gene products, are expressed in skeletal muscle and localize to the postsynaptic folds and to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Here we report the molecular cloning, tissue expression, and subcellular targeting of Ank(G107), a novel ankyrin-G from rat skeletal muscle. Ank(G107) lacks the entire ANK repeat domain and contains a 76-residue sequence near the COOH terminus. This sequence shares homology with COOH-terminal sequences of ankyrins-R and ankyrins-B, including the muscle-specific skAnk1. Despite widespread tissue expression of Ank3, the 76-residue sequence is predominantly detected in transcripts of skeletal muscle and heart, including both major 8- and 5.6-kb mRNAs of skeletal muscle. In 15-day-old rat skeletal muscle, antibodies against the 76-residue sequence localized to the sarcolemma and to the postsynaptic membrane and cross-reacted with three endogenous ankyrins-G, including one 130-kDa polypeptide that comigrated with in vitro translated Ank(G107).

Green fluorescent protein-tagged Ank(G107) transfected in primary cultures of rat myotubes was targeted to the plasma membrane. Deletion of the 76-residue insert resulted in additional cytoplasmic labeling suggestive of a reduced stability of Ank(G107) at the membrane. Recruitment of the COOH-terminal domain to the membrane was much less efficient but still possible only in the presence of the 76-residue insert. We conclude that the 76-residue sequence contributes to the localization and is essential to the stabilization of Ank(G107) at the membrane. These results suggest that tissue-dependent and developmentally regulated alternative processing of ankyrins generates isoforms with distinct sequences, potentially involved in specific protein-protein interactions during differentiation of the sarcolemma and, in particular, of the postsynaptic membrane.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,429,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.98524296,1

In a display with a stationary and a moving object, subjects saccaded towards one of the objects and had to detect intrasaccadic changes in position or orientation of either the saccade target or the saccade flanker. Compared to performance for stationary objects, displacement detection for translating objects was better and unaffected by saccadic status of the changed object. This pattern proved to be specific to position changes in translating objects and did not generalize to other types of motion (i.e., rotation) or to other types of intrasaccadic changes (i.e., orientation shifts). Superior transsaccadic coding of the position of a translating object was also observed in control experiments with only a single object present on each trial. Possible accounts in terms of selective attention to moving objects and perceptual relevance of object position are pitted against the data, suggesting qualitative differences in the transsaccadic representation of translating and stationary objects.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,435,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.00349701,0

A chiral separation using carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin for the direct assay of tramadol in human urine by capillary electrophoresis (CE) with laser-induced native fluorescence detection was developed. Furthermore, the phase II metabolite O-demethyl tramadol glucuronide was determined from the urine samples and the ratio of the diasteromers was determined. The chiral method was validated. Correlation coefficients were higher than 0.999. Within day variation showed accuracy in the range 96.1-105.8% with a RSD less than 6.00%. Day to day variation present an accuracy ranging from 100.2 to 103.5% with a RSD less than 5.4%. After oral administration of 150 mg tramadol hydrochloride to a healthy volunteer, the urinary excretion was monitored during 24 h. About 11.4% of the dose was excreted as 1S,2S-tramadol, 16.4% as 1R,2R-tramadol and 23.7% as O-demethyl tramadol glucuronide. The amount of 1S,2S O-demethyl tramadol glucuronide was more than three fold higher as IR,2R-O-demethyl tramadol glucuronide.

11828326,"A pre-translocational intermediate in protein synthesis observed in crystals of enzymatically active 50S subunits. The large ribosomal subunit catalyzes peptide bond formation during protein synthesis. Its peptidyl transferase activity has often been studied using a 'fragment assay' that depends on high concentrations of methanol or ethanol. Here we describe a version of this assay that does not require alcohol and use it to show, both crystallographically and biochemically, that crystals of the large ribosomal subunits from Haloarcula marismortui are enzymatically active. Addition of these crystals to solutions containing substrates results in formation of products, which ceases when crystals are removed. When substrates are diffused into large subunit crystals, the subsequent structure shows that products have formed. The CC-puromycin-peptide product is found bound to the A-site and the deacylated CCA is bound to the P-site, with its 3prime prime or minute OH near N3 A2486 (Escherichia coli A2451). Thus, this structure represents a state that occurs after peptide bond formation but before the hybrid state of protein synthesis.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,445,pos_MEDLINE,0.9953544,1
11846551,"Homology between O-linked GlcNAc transferases and proteins of the glycogen phosphorylase superfamily. The O-linked GlcNAc transferases (OGTs) are a recently characterized group of largely eukaryotic enzymes that add a single beta-N-acetylglucosamine moiety to specific serine or threonine hydroxyls. In humans, this process may be part of a sugar regulation mechanism or cellular signaling pathway that is involved in many important diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration. However, no structural information about the human OGT exists, except for the identification of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) at the N terminus. The locations of substrate binding sites are unknown and the structural basis for this enzyme's function is not clear. Here, remote homology is reported between the OGTs and a large group of diverse sugar processing enzymes, including proteins with known structure such as glycogen phosphorylase, UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase, and the glycosyl transferase MurG. This relationship, in conjunction with amino acid similarity spanning the entire length of the sequence, implies that the fold of the human OGT consists of two Rossmann-like domains C-terminal to the TPR region. A conserved motif in the second Rossmann domain points to the UDP-GlcNAc donor binding site. This conclusion is supported by a combination of statistically significant PSI-BLAST hits, consensus secondary structure predictions, and a fold recognition hit to MurG. Additionally, iterative PSI-BLAST database searches reveal that proteins homologous to the OGTs form a large and diverse superfamily that is termed GPGTF (glycogen phosphorylase/glycosyl transferase). Up to one-third of the 51 functional families in the CAZY database, a glycosyl transferase classification scheme based on catalytic residue and sequence homology considerations, can be unified through this common predicted fold. GPGTF homologs constitute a substantial fraction of known proteins: 0.4% of all non-redundant sequences and about 1% of proteins in the Escherichia coli genome are found to belong to the GPGTF superfamily.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,447,pos_MEDLINE,0.9955142,1

Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome is a newly characterised and increasingly recognized clinico-radiologic syndrome. Underlying conditions that reportedly trigger this syndrome include hypertensive encephalopathy, eclampsia, renal failure, and immunosuppressive drug therapy with cyclosporine, tacrolimus and interferon alpha. We describe a 51-year-old woman with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with conventional CHOP chemotherapy. Eight days after this treatment she developed severe headache, bilateral visual loss and focal seizures with secondary generalization. Neurologic examination showed confusion, cortical blindness, and left hemiparesis with hyperreflexia and sensory loss. A cranial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed increased signal intensity in the occipital and frontal lobes in both hemispheres and right parietal lobe. A diagnosis of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy was made. She presented a favourable outcome with conservative treatment with mannitol and phenytoin. A new cranial scanning showed nearly complete resolution of the abnormalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy in a patient treated with standard-dose CHOP.

11872665,"Assessment of the role of interstitial glucagon in the acute glucose secretory responsiveness of in situ pancreatic beta-cells. Glucagon is a potent stimulator of insulin release in the presence of a permissive glucose concentration, activating beta-cells in vitro via both glucagon- and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-receptors. It is still unclear whether locally released glucagon amplifies the secretory responsiveness of neighboring beta-cells in the intact pancreas. The present study investigates this question in the perfused pancreas by examining the effects of antagonists for glucagon receptors ([des-His(1),des-Phe(6),Glu(9)]glucagon-NH(2), 10 micromol/l) and GLP-1-receptors [exendin-(9-39)-NH(2), 1 micromol/l] on the insulin secretory response to glucose. The specificity of both antagonists was demonstrated by their selective interaction with glucagon-receptor signaling in rat hepatocytes and GLP-1-receptor signaling in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) fibroblasts. In purified rat beta-cells, the glucagon-receptor antagonist (10 micromol/l) inhibited the effect of 1 nmol/l glucagon upon glucose-induced insulin release by 78 plus minus 6%. In the perfused rat pancreas, neither of these antagonists inhibited the potent secretory response to 20 mmol/l glucose, although they effectively suppressed the potentiating effect of, respectively, an infusion of glucagon (1 nmol/l) or GLP-1 (1 nmol/l) on insulin release. When endogenous glucagon release was enhanced by isoproterenol (100 nmol/l), no amplification was seen in the simultaneous or subsequent insulin secretory response to glucose. It is concluded that, at least under the present selected conditions, the glucose-induced insulin release by the perfused rat pancreas seems to occur independent of an amplifying glucagon signal from neighboring alpha-cells.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,457,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.00402291,0
11889129,"Structural rearrangement of human lymphotactin, a C chemokine, under physiological solution conditions. NMR spectra of human lymphotactin (hLtn), obtained under various solution conditions, have revealed that the protein undergoes a major conformational rearrangement dependent on temperature and salt concentration. At high salt (200 mm NaCl) and low temperature (10 degrees C), hLtn adopts a chemokine-like fold, which consists of a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and a C-terminal alpha-helix (Kuloğlu, E. S., McCaslin, D. R., Kitabwalla, M., Pauza, C. D., Markley, J. L., and Volkman, B. F. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12486-12496). We have used NMR spectroscopy, sedimentation equilibrium, and intrinsic fluorescence to monitor the reversible conformational change undergone by hLtn as a function of temperature and ionic strength. We have used two-, three- and four-dimensional NMR spectroscopy of isotopically enriched protein samples to determine structural properties of the conformational state stabilized at 45 degrees C and 0 mm NaCl. Patterns of NOEs and (1)H(alpha) and (13)C chemical shifts show that hLtn rearranges under these conditions to form a four-stranded, antiparallel beta-sheet with a pattern of hydrogen bonding that is completely different from that of the chemokine fold stabilized at 10 degrees C and 200 mm NaCl. The C-terminal alpha-helix observed at 10 degrees C and 200 mm NaCl, which is conserved in other chemokines, is absent at 45 degrees C and no salt, and the last 38 residues of the protein are completely disordered, as indicated by heteronuclear (15)N-(1)H NOEs. Temperature dependence of the tryptophan fluorescence of hLtn in low and high salt confirmed that the chemokine conformation is stabilized by increased ionic strength. Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation showed that hLtn at 40 degrees C in the presence of 100 mm NaCl exists mainly as a dimer. Under near physiological conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength, both the chemokine-like and non-chemokine-like conformations of hLtn are significantly populated.

11917013,"Correlated alternative side chain conformations in the RNA-recognition motif of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1. The RNA-recognition motif (RRM) is a common and evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding module. Crystallographic and solution structural studies have shown that RRMs adopt a compact alpha/beta structure, in which four antiparallel beta-strands form the major RNA-binding surface. Conserved aromatic residues in the RRM are located on the surface of the beta-sheet and are important for RNA binding. To further our understanding of the structural basis of RRM-nucleic acid interaction, we carried out a high resolution analysis of UP1, the N-terminal, two-RRM domain of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1), whose structure was previously solved at 1.75-1.9 A resolution. The two RRMs of hnRNP A1 are closely related but have distinct functions in regulating alternative pre-mRNA splice site selection. Our present 1.1 A resolution crystal structure reveals that two conserved solvent-exposed phenylalanines in the first RRM have alternative side chain conformations. These conformations are spatially correlated, as the individual amino acids cannot adopt each of the observed conformations independently. These phenylalanines are critical for nucleic acid binding and the observed alternative side chain conformations may serve as a mechanism for regulating nucleic acid binding by RRM-containing proteins.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,469,pos_MEDLINE,0.99791294,1

The crystal structure of the recombinant thiamin diphosphate-dependent E1 component from the Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDHc) has been determined at a resolution of 1.85 A. The E. coli PDHc E1 component E1p is a homodimeric enzyme and crystallizes with an intact dimer in an asymmetric unit. Each E1p subunit consists of three domains: N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal, with all having alpha/beta folds. The functional dimer contains two catalytic centers located at the interface between subunits. The ThDP cofactors are bound in the ""V"" conformation in clefts between the two subunits (binding involves the N-terminal and middle domains), and there is a common ThDP binding fold. The cofactors are completely buried, as only the C2 atoms are accessible from solution through the active site clefts. Significant structural differences are observed between individual domains of E1p relative to heterotetrameric multienzyme complex E1 components operating on branched chain substrates. These differences may be responsible for reported alternative E1p binding modes to E2 components within the respective complexes. This paper represents the first structural example of a functional pyruvate dehydrogenase E1p component from any species. It also provides the first representative example for the entire family of homodimeric (alpha2) E1 multienzyme complex components, and should serve as a model for this class of enzymes.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,472,pos_MEDLINE,0.9974191,1

11959977,"Structural basis for Hif-1 alpha /CBP recognition in the cellular hypoxic response. The cellular response to low tissue oxygen concentrations is mediated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 activates transcription of critical adaptive genes by recruitment of the general coactivators CBP/p300 through interactions with its alpha-subunit (Hif-1 alpha). Disruption of the Hif-1 alpha/p300 interaction has been linked to attenuation of tumor growth. To delineate the structural basis for this interaction, we have determined the solution structure of the complex between the carboxy-terminal activation domain (CAD) of Hif-1 alpha and the zinc-binding TAZ1 (CH1) motif of cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP). Despite the overall similarity of the TAZ1 structure to that of the TAZ2 (part of the CH3) domain of CBP, differences occur in the packing of helices that can account for differences in specificity. The unbound CAD is intrinsically disordered and remains relatively extended upon binding, wrapping almost entirely around the TAZ1 domain in a groove through much of its surface. Three short helices are formed upon binding, stabilized by intermolecular interactions. The Asn-803 side chain, which functions as a hypoxic switch, is located on the second of these helices and is buried in the molecular interface. The third helix of the Hif-1 alpha CAD docks in a deep hydrophobic groove in TAZ1, providing extensive intermolecular hydrophobic interactions that contribute to the stability of the complex. The structure of this complex provides new insights into the mechanism through which Hif-1 alpha recruits CBP/p300 in response to hypoxia.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,476,pos_MEDLINE,0.997981,1

12027377,"Saccharin as a sugar surrogate revisited. Two papers by George Collier are reviewed and replications and extensions of these data are presented. The first paper by Collier and Bolles (1968) reported the total caloric intake of rats during sucrose versus water preference tests. In addition, a paired comparison was made with each of a wide range of sucrose solutions. The latter experiment resulted in a re-thinking of ""preference"" in that it showed that although rats drank more of a middle range concentration, they always consumed more of the higher concentrations in paired comparison tests. Many other behavioral studies have confirmed that the rat's attraction to the taste of sucrose is a direct function of sucrose concentration. The second paper by Collier and Novell (1967) reported that saccharin was similar to sucrose in that intake increased and then decreased as concentration increased, although in direct choice tests, higher concentrations were preferred to lower ones except in one case. Subsequent studies using a wider range of saccharin concentrations and a variety of test measures revealed, however, that saccharin preference and acceptance decreases substantially as concentration exceeds 0.4% (19.5 mM). Furthermore, saccharin versus sucrose choice tests indicate that optimal saccharin solutions (0.2-0.4%) are ""isopreferred"" to only dilute sucrose solutions (2-4%).

The capsid protein (CA) of the mature human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) contains an N-terminal beta-hairpin that is essential for formation of the capsid core particle. CA is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the Gag precursor polyprotein during viral maturation. We have determined the NMR structure of a 283-residue N-terminal fragment of immature HIV-1 Gag (Gag(283)), which includes the intact matrix (MA) and N-terminal capsid (CA(N)) domains. The beta-hairpin is unfolded in Gag(283), consistent with the proposal that hairpin formation occurs subsequent to proteolytic cleavage of Gag, triggering capsid assembly. Comparison of the immature and mature CA(N) structures reveals that beta-hairpin formation induces a approximately 2 A displacement of helix 6 and a concomitant displacement of the cyclophylin-A (CypA)-binding loop, suggesting a possible allosteric mechanism for CypA-mediated destabilization of the capsid particle during infectivity.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,491,pos_MEDLINE,0.9975466,1

The crystal structure of a hydroxylated HIF-1 alpha peptide bound to VCB (pVHL, elongins C and B) and solution binding assays reveal a single, conserved hydroxyproline-binding pocket in pVHL.

In order for the 61 kDa colicin E9 protein toxin to enter the cytoplasm of susceptible cells and kill them by hydrolysing their DNA, the colicin must interact with the outer membrane BtuB receptor and Tol translocation pathway of target cells. The translocation function is located in the N-terminal domain of the colicin molecule. (1)H, (1)H-(1)H-(15)N and (1)H-(13)C-(15)N NMR studies of intact colicin E9, its DNase domain, minimal receptor-binding domain and two N-terminal constructs containing the translocation domain showed that the region of the translocation domain that governs the interaction of colicin E9 with TolB is largely unstructured and highly flexible. Of the expected 80 backbone NH resonances of the first 83 residues of intact colicin E9, 61 were identified, with 43 of them being assigned specifically. The absence of secondary structure for these was shown through chemical shift analyses and the lack of long-range NOEs in (1)H-(1)H-(15)N NOESY spectra (tau(m)=200 ms). The enhanced flexibility of the region of the translocation domain containing the TolB box compared to the overall tumbling rate of the protein was identified from the relatively large values of backbone and tryptophan indole (15)N spin-spin relaxation times, and from the negative (1)H-(15)N NOEs of the backbone NH resonances. Variable flexibility of the N-terminal region was revealed by the (15)N T(1)/T(2) ratios, which showed that the C-terminal end of the TolB box and the region immediately following it was motionally constrained compared to other parts of the N terminus. This, together with the observation of inter-residue NOEs involving Ile54, indicated that there was some structural ordering, resulting most probably from the interactions of side-chains. Conformational heterogeneity of parts of the translocation domain was evident from a multiplicity of signals for some of the residues. Im9 binding to colicin E9 had no effect on the chemical shifts or other NMR characteristics of the region of colicin E9 containing the TolB recognition sequence, though the interaction of TolB with intact colicin E9 bound to Im9 did affect resonances from this region. The flexibility of the translocation domain of colicin E9 may be connected with its need to recognise protein partners that assist it in crossing the outer membrane and in the translocation event itself.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,500,pos_MEDLINE,0.997459,1

A series of 138 nonchiral 3-amidinobenzyl-1H-indole-2-carboxamides and analogues as inhibitors of the blood coagulation enzyme factor Xa (fXa) were designed, synthesized, and investigated by X-ray structure analysis and 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies (CoMFA, CoMSIA) in order to identify important protein-ligand interactions responsible for biological affinity and selectivity. Several compounds from this series are highly potent and selective inhibitors of this important enzyme linking extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways. To rationalize biological affinity and to provide guidelines for further design, all compounds were docked into the factor Xa binding site. Those docking studies were based on X-ray structures of factor Xa in complex with literature-known inhibitors. It was possible to validate those binding modes by four X-ray crystal structures of representative ligands in factor Xa, while one ligand was additionally crystallized in trypsin to rationalize requirements for selective factor Xa inhibition. The 3D-QSAR models based on a superposition rule derived from these docking studies were validated using conventional and cross-validated r(2) values using the leave-one-out method and repeated analyses using two randomly chosen cross-validation groups plus randomization of biological activities. This led to consistent and highly predictive 3D-QSAR models with good correlation coefficients for both CoMFA and CoMSIA, which were found to correspond to experimentally determined factor Xa binding site topology in terms of steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic complementarity. Subsets selected as smaller training sets using 2D fingerprints and maximum dissimilarity methods resulted in 3D-QSAR models with remarkable correlation coefficients and a high predictive power.

The gene encoding hemolysin II (HlyII) was amplified from Bacillus cereus genomic DNA and a truncated mutant, HlyII(DeltaCT), was constructed lacking the 94 amino acid extension at the C terminus. The proteins were produced in an E. coli cell-free in vitro transcription and translation system, and were shown to assemble into SDS-stable oligomers on rabbit erythrocyte membranes and liposomes. The hemolytic activity of HlyII was measured with rabbit erythrocytes yielding an HC(50) value of 1.64 ng mL(-1), which is over 15 times more potent than staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin. HlyII(DeltaCT) was about eight times less potent than HlyII in this assay. Limited proteolysis of the oligomers formed by HlyII and HlyII(DeltaCT) on red cell membranes showed that the C-terminal extension is sensitive to digestion, while HlyII(DeltaCT) is protease resistant and migrates with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of digested HlyII. HlyII forms moderately anion selective, rectifying pores (I(+80)/I(-80) = 0.57, 1 M KCl, pH 7.4) in planar lipid bilayers of diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine with a unitary conductance of 637 pS (1 M KCl, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and exhibits no gating over a wide range of applied potentials (-160 to +160 mV). In addition, it was demonstrated that HlyII forms a homoheptameric pore by using gel shift electrophoresis aided by a genetically encoded oligoaspartate tag.

BACKGROUND Previously, neurologic dysfunction was estimated to complicate 25% or less of pediatric open-heart operations. We sought to determine the current incidence and spectrum of early postoperative neurologic complications. METHODS We undertook a retrospective review of all patients undergoing open heart operations in 1 year at our institution with the goal to identify all neurologic complications occurring in the early postoperative period. RESULTS Open-heart operations were performed in 706 children. Sixteen children (2.3%) had neurologic complications develop, including 9 (1.3%) with definite clinical seizures, 1 with suspected seizures and bilateral subdural hemorrhage, 2 with coma after cardiac arrest, 2 with transient mild choreoathetosis, 1 with facial palsy, and 1 with persistent irritability. Causes of seizure were cyclosporin A toxicity posttransplant (4), cerebral ischemia post cardiac arrest (3), and unknown (2). In infants less than 1 year of age, the incidence of seizures was 1.2%.

12176328,"Developmental compartments and planar polarity in Drosophila. BACKGROUND Planar polarity refers to the asymmetry of a cell within the plane of the epithelium; for example, cells may form hairs that point in a posterior direction, or cilia may beat in one way. This property implies that cells have information about their orientation; we wish to understand the nature of this information. Relevant also is the body plan of insects, which, in the ectoderm and somatic mesoderm, consists of a chain of alternating anterior and posterior compartments - basic units of development with independent cell lineage and subject to independent genetic control. RESULTS Using the abdomen of adult Drosophila, we have taken genes required for normal polarity and either removed the gene or constitutively expressed it in small clones of cells and observed the effects on polarity. Hitherto, all such studies of polarity genes have not found any difference of behavior between the different compartments. We report here that the three genes, four-jointed, dachsous, and fat, cause opposite effects in anterior and posterior compartments. For example, in anterior compartments, clones ectopically expressing four-jointed reverse the polarity of cells in front of the clone, while, in posterior compartments, they reverse behind the clone. These three genes have been reported by others to be functionally linked. CONCLUSIONS This discovery impacts on models of how cells read polarity. At the heart of one class of models is the hypothesis that cell polarity is determined by the vector of a morphogen gradient. Here, we present evidence that cell polarity in the abdomen depends on at least two protein gradients (Fj and Ds), each of which is reflected at compartment borders. Consequently, these gradients have opposing slopes in the two compartments. Because all polarized structures made by abdominal cells point posteriorly, we surmise that cells in each compartment are programmed to interpret these protein gradients with opposite signs, pointing up the gradient in one compartment and down the gradient in the other.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,533,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0032794434,0
12185246,"Structural insights into peptide bond formation. The large ribosomal subunit catalyzes peptide bond formation and will do so by using small aminoacyl- and peptidyl-RNA fragments of tRNA. We have refined at 3-A resolution the structures of both A and P site substrate and product analogues, as well as an intermediate analogue, bound to the Haloarcula marismortui 50S ribosomal subunit. A P site substrate, CCA-Phe-caproic acid-biotin, binds equally to both sites, but in the presence of sparsomycin binds only to the P site. The CCA portions of these analogues are bound identically by either the A or P loop of the 23S rRNA. Combining the separate P and A site substrate complexes into one model reveals interactions that may occur when both are present simultaneously. The alpha-NH(2) group of an aminoacylated fragment in the A site forms one hydrogen bond with the N3 of A2486 (2451) and may form a second hydrogen bond either with the 2' OH of the A-76 ribose in the P site or with the 2' OH of A2486 (2451). These interactions position the alpha amino group adjacent to the carbonyl carbon of esterified P site substrate in an orientation suitable for a nucleophilic attack.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,534,pos_MEDLINE,0.99586606,1

HNF4 alpha is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor family with prominent functions in liver, gut, kidney and pancreatic beta cells. We have solved the x-ray crystal structure of the HNF4 alpha ligand binding domain, which adopts a canonical fold. Two conformational states are present within each homodimer: an open form with alpha helix 12 (alpha 12) extended and collinear with alpha 10 and a closed form with alpha 12 folded against the body of the domain. Although the protein was crystallized without added ligands, the ligand binding pockets of both closed and open forms contain fatty acids. The carboxylic acid headgroup of the fatty acid ion pairs with the guanidinium group of Arg(226) at one end of the ligand binding pocket, while the aliphatic chain fills a long, narrow channel that is lined with hydrophobic residues. These findings suggest that fatty acids are endogenous ligands for HNF4 alpha and establish a framework for understanding how HNF4 alpha activity is enhanced by ligand binding and diminished by MODY1 mutations.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,535,pos_MEDLINE,0.9977083,1

The quorum sensing system allows bacteria to sense their cell density and initiate an altered pattern of gene expression after a sufficient quorum of cells has accumulated. In Agrobacterium tumefaciens, quorum sensing controls conjugal transfer of the tumour- inducing plasmid, responsible for plant crown gall disease. The core components of this system are the transcriptional regulator TraR and its inducing ligand N-(3-oxo-octanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone. This complex binds DNA and activates gene expression. We have determined the crystal structure of TraR in complex with its autoinducer and target DNA (PDB code 1h0m). The protein is dimeric, with each monomer composed of an N-terminal domain, which binds the ligand in an enclosed cavity far from the dimerization region, and a C-terminal domain, which binds DNA via a helix-turn-helix motif. The structure reveals an asymmetric homodimer, with one monomer longer than the other. The N-terminal domain resembles GAF/PAS domains, normally fused to catalytic signalling domains. In TraR, the gene fusion is between a GAF/PAS domain and a DNA-binding domain, resulting in a specific transcriptional regulator involved in quorum sensing.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,538,pos_MEDLINE,0.99771273,1

The cytoplasmic domain of B ephrins plays a central role in bidirectional signal transduction processes controlling pattern formation and morphogenesis, such as axon guidance, cell migration, segmentation, and angiogensis. In particular, the extremely conserved last 33-residue cytoplasmic subdomain was shown to bind to both a PDZ domain for one signaling pathway [Lu et al. (2001) Cell 105, 69-79] and an SH2 domain from an alternative signaling network [Cowan and Henkemeyer (2001) Nature 413, 174-179]. To date, no structural information is available for the cytoplasmic domain of ephrin B proteins. We report here a detailed NMR study on the structural and dynamic properties of the cytoplasmic domain of human ephrin B2. Our results reveal the following: (1) the N-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain from residues 253 to 300 lacks the ability for structure formation and is particularly prone to aggregation; and (2) the C-terminal functional subdomain from residues 301 to 333 assumes two distinctive structural elements with residues 301-322 adopting a well-packed hairpin structure followed by a flexible C-terminal tail. Furthermore, the backbone (15)N relaxation data demonstrate that the hairpin structure has significantly limited backbone motions, indicating a high conformational stability for the folded structure. Therefore, while the flexible C-terminal tail is suitable for binding to the PDZ domain, the folded hairpin may represent a latent structure requiring phosphorylation-induced conformational changes for high-affinity interactions with the SH2 domain.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,543,pos_MEDLINE,0.9976993,1

Gene-inactivation studies point to the involvement of OxyB in catalyzing the first oxidative phenol coupling reaction during glycopeptide antibiotic biosynthesis. The oxyB gene has been cloned and sequenced from the vancomycin producer Amycolatopsis orientalis, and the hemoprotein has been produced in Escherichia coli, crystallized, and its structure determined to 1.7-A resolution. OxyB gave UV-visible spectra characteristic of a P450-like hemoprotein in the low spin ferric state. After reduction to the ferrous state by dithionite or by spinach ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase, the CO-ligated form gave a 450-nm peak in a UV-difference spectrum. Addition of putative heptapeptide substrates to resting OxyB produced type I changes to the UV spectrum, but no turnover was observed in the presence of ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase, showing that either the peptides or the reduction system, or both, are insufficient to support a full catalytic cycle. OxyB exhibits the typical P450-fold, with helix L containing the signature sequence FGHGXHXCLG and Cys(347) being the proximal axial thiolate ligand of the heme iron. The structural similarity of OxyB is highest to P450nor, P450terp, CYP119, and P450eryF. In OxyB, the F and G helices are rotated out of the active site compared with P450nor, resulting in a much more open active site, consistent with the larger size of the presumed heptapeptide substrate.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,544,pos_MEDLINE,0.99723166,1
12217702,"Structure and orientation of a G protein fragment in the receptor bound state from residual dipolar couplings. Residual dipolar couplings for a ligand that is in fast exchange between a free state and a state where it is bound to a macroscopically ordered membrane protein carry precise information on the structure and orientation of the bound ligand. The couplings originate in the bound state but can be detected on the free ligand using standard high resolution NMR. This approach is used to study an analog of the C-terminal undecapeptide of the alpha-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein transducin when bound to photo-activated rhodopsin. Rhodopsin is the major constituent of disk-shaped membrane vesicles from rod outer segments of bovine retinas, which align spontaneously in the NMR magnet. Photo-activation of rhodopsin triggers transient binding of the peptide, resulting in measurable dipolar contributions to 1J(NH) and 1J(CH) splittings. These dipolar couplings report on the time-averaged orientation of bond vectors in the bound peptide relative to the magnetic field, i.e. relative to the membrane normal. Approximate distance restraints of the bound conformation were derived from transferred NOEs, as measured from the difference of NOESY spectra recorded prior to and after photo-activation. The N-terminal eight residues of the bound undecapeptide adopt a near-ideal alpha-helical conformation. The helix is terminated by an alpha(L) type C-cap, with Gly9 at the C' position in the center of the reverse turn. The angle between the helix axis and the membrane normal is 40 degrees (+/-4) degrees. Peptide protons that make close contact with the receptor are identified by analysis of the NOESY cross-relaxation pattern and include the hydrophobic C terminus of the peptide.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,547,pos_MEDLINE,0.99731135,1

Substrate selectivity and proteolytic activity for the E. coli ATP-dependent protease, ClpAP, is modulated by an adaptor protein, ClpS. ClpS binds to ClpA, the regulatory component of the ClpAP complex. We report the crystal structure of ClpS in complex with the isolated N-terminal domain of ClpA in two different crystal forms at 2.3- and 3.3-A resolution. The ClpS structure forms an alpha/beta-sandwich and is topologically analogous to the C-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L7/L12. ClpS contacts two surfaces on the N-terminal domain in both crystal forms; the more extensive interface was shown to be favored in solution by protease protection experiments. The N-terminal 20 residues of ClpS are not visible in the crystal structures; the removal of the first 17 residues produces ClpSDeltaN, which binds to the ClpA N-domain but no longer inhibits ClpA activity. A zinc binding site involving two His and one Glu residue was identified crystallographically in the N-terminal domain of ClpA. In a model of ClpS bound to hexameric ClpA, ClpS is oriented with its N terminus directed toward the distal surface of ClpA, suggesting that the N-terminal region of ClpS may affect productive substrate interactions at the apical surface or substrate entry into the ClpA translocation channel.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,554,pos_MEDLINE,0.9980506,1

Recombinant U2AF35 RRM protein free and in complex with three different regions of U2AF65 was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We found that the recombinant U2AF35 RRM is unstructured in solution but its tertiary structure is induced upon binding to U2AF65.

Here, we present the refined solution structures of the NHP6A-DNA complex as well as the free 15bp DNA. Both the free and bound forms of the protein adopt the typical L-shaped HMGB domain fold. The DNA in the complex undergoes significant structural rearrangement from its free form while the protein shows smaller but significant conformational changes in the complex. Structural and mutational analysis as well as comparison of the complex with the free DNA provides insight into the factors that contribute to binding site selection and DNA deformations in the complex.

12392550,"Ribosome-associated factor Y adopts a fold resembling a double-stranded RNA binding domain scaffold. Escherichia coli protein Y (pY) binds to the small ribosomal subunit and stabilizes ribosomes against dissociation when bacteria experience environmental stress. pY inhibits translation in vitro, most probably by interfering with the binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A site. Such a translational arrest may mediate overall adaptation of cells to environmental conditions. We have determined the 3D solution structure of a 112-residue pY and have studied its backbone dynamic by NMR spectroscopy. The structure has a betaalphabetabetabetaalpha topology and represents a compact two-layered sandwich of two nearly parallel alpha helices packed against the same side of a four-stranded beta sheet. The 23 C-terminal residues of the protein are disordered. Long-range angular constraints provided by residual dipolar coupling data proved critical for precisely defining the position of helix 1. Our data establish that the C-terminal region of helix 1 and the loop linking this helix with strand beta2 show significant conformational exchange in the ms- micro s time scale, which may have relevance to the interaction of pY with ribosomal subunits. Distribution of the conserved residues on the protein surface highlights a positively charged region towards the C-terminal segments of both alpha helices, which most probably constitutes an RNA binding site. The observed betaalphabetabetabetaalpha topology of pY resembles the alphabetabetabetaalpha topology of double-stranded RNA-binding domains, despite limited sequence similarity.

On a molar basis, TatA is the major pathway component. Here we show that TatA can be purified independently of the other Tat proteins as a 460 kDa homooligomeric complex. Homooligomer formation requires the amino-terminal membrane-anchoring domain of TatA. According to circular dichroism spectroscopy, approximately half of the TatA polypeptide forms alpha-helical secondary structure in both detergent solution and proteoliposomes.

The 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the first step of protein synthesis and establish the rules of the genetic code through aminoacylation reactions. Biological fragments of two human enzymes, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, connect protein synthesis to cell-signaling pathways including angiogenesis. Alternative splicing or proteolysis produces these fragments. The proangiogenic N-terminal fragment mini-TyrRS has IL-8-like cytokine activity that, like other CXC cytokines, depends on a Glu-Leu-Arg motif. Point mutations in this motif abolish cytokine activity. The full-length native TyrRS lacks cytokine activity. No structure has been available for any mammalian tRNA synthetase that, in turn, might give insight into why mini-TyrRS and not TyrRS has cytokine activities. Here, the structure of human mini-TyrRS, which contains both the catalytic and the anticodon recognition domain, is reported to a resolution of 1.18 A. The critical Glu-Leu-Arg motif is located on an internal alpha-helix of the catalytic domain, where the guanidino side chain of R is part of a hydrogen-bonding network tethering the anticodon-recognition domain back to the catalytic site. Whereas the catalytic domains of the human and bacterial enzymes superimpose, the spatial disposition of the anticodon recognition domain relative to the catalytic domain is unique in mini-TyrRS relative to the bacterial orthologs.

Two identical protein molecules are bound to the promoter.

Atypical elements in both domains create a stable interface that further distinguishes HNF-1alpha from other flexible POU-homeodomain proteins.

The NMR structure of the recombinant human doppel protein, hDpl(24-152), contains a flexibly disordered ""tail"" comprising residues 24-51, and a globular domain extending from residues 52 to 149 for which a detailed structure was obtained. The globular domain contains four alpha-helices comprising residues 72-80 (alpha1), 101-115 (alpha2(a)), 117-121 (alpha2(b)), and 127-141 (alpha3), and a short two-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet comprising residues 58-60 (beta1) and 88-90 (beta2). The fold of the hDpl globular domain thus coincides nearly identically with the structure of the murine Dpl protein. There are close similarities with the human prion protein (hPrP) but, similar to the situation with the corresponding murine proteins, hDpl shows marked local differences when compared to hPrP: the beta-sheet is flipped by 180 degrees with respect to the molecular scaffold formed by the four helices, and the beta1-strand is shifted by two residues toward the C terminus. A large solvent-accessible hydrophobic cleft is formed on the protein surface between beta2 and alpha3, which has no counterpart in hPrP. The helix alpha2 of hPrP is replaced by two shorter helices, alpha2(a) and alpha2(b). The helix alpha3 is shortened by more than two turns when compared with alpha3 of hPrP, which is enforced by the positioning of the second disulfide bond in hDpl. The C-terminal peptide segment 144-149 folds back onto the loop connecting beta2 and alpha2. All but four of the 20 conserved residues in the globular domains of hPrP and hDpl appear to have a structural role in maintaining a PrP-type fold. The conservation of R76, E96, N110 and R134 in hDpl, corresponding to R148, E168, N183 and R208 in hPrP suggests that these amino acid residues might have essential roles in the so far unknown functions of PrP and Dpl in healthy organisms.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,624,pos_MEDLINE,0.99766326,1

Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are members of a large group of hydrophilic, glycine-rich proteins found in plants, algae, fungi, and bacteria known collectively as hydrophilins that are preferentially expressed in response to dehydration or hyperosmotic stress. Group 2 LEA (dehydrins or responsive to abscisic acid) proteins are postulated to stabilize macromolecules against damage by freezing, dehydration, ionic, or osmotic stress. However, the structural and physicochemical properties of group 2 LEA proteins that account for such functions remain unknown. We have analyzed the structural properties of a recombinant form of a soybean (Glycine max) group 2 LEA (rGmDHN1). Differential scanning calorimetry of purified rGmDHN1 demonstrated that the protein does not display a cooperative unfolding transition upon heating. Ultraviolet absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the protein is in a largely hydrated and unstructured conformation in solution. However, ultraviolet absorption and circular dichroism measurements collected at different temperatures showed that the protein exists in equilibrium between two extended conformational states: unordered and left-handed extended helical or poly (L-proline)-type II structures. It is estimated that 27% of the residues of rGmDHN1 adopt or poly (L-proline)-type II-like helical conformation at 12 degrees C. The content of extended helix gradually decreases to 15% as the temperature is increased to 80 degrees C. Studies of the conformation of the protein in solution in the presence of liposomes, trifluoroethanol, and sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that rGmDHN1 has a very low intrinsic ability to adopt alpha-helical structure and to interact with phospholipid bilayers through amphipathic alpha-helices. The ability of the protein to remain in a highly extended conformation at low temperatures could constitute the basis of the functional role of GmDHN1 in the prevention of freezing, desiccation, ionic, or osmotic stress-related damage to macromolecular structures.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,642,pos_MEDLINE,0.99723166,1

In Caenorhabditis elegans, an X chromosome-counting mechanism specifies sexual fate. Specific genes termed X-signal elements, which are present on the X chromosome, act in a concerted dose-dependent fashion to regulate levels of the developmental switch gene xol-1. In turn, xol-1 levels determine sexual fate and the activation state of the dosage compensation mechanism. The crystal structure of the XOL-1 protein at 1.55 A resolution unexpectedly reveals that xol-1 encodes a GHMP kinase family member, despite sequence identity of 10% or less. Because GHMP kinases, thus far, have only been characterized as small molecule kinases involved in metabolic pathways, for example, amino acid and cholesterol synthesis, XOL-1 is the first member that controls nonmetabolic processes. Biochemical investigations demonstrated that XOL-1 does not bind ATP under standard conditions, suggesting that XOL-1 acts by a mechanism distinct from that of other GHMP kinases. In addition, we have cloned a XOL-1 ortholog from Caenorhabditis briggsae, a related nematode that diverged from C. elegans approximately 50-100 million years ago.

Moreover, in the crystalline state, the 10-kDa subdomain formed dimers. The results of gel filtration chromatography further supported the view that this subdomain was self-associated. Upon gel filtration, Hsc70 was found to exist as a mixture of monomers, dimers, and oligomers, but the 60-kDa fragment was predominantly found to exist as monomers.

12783876,"Crystal structure of the ectodomain of human FcalphaRI. Human FcalphaRI (CD89) is the receptor specific for IgA, an immunoglobulin that is abundant in mucosa and is also found in high concentrations in serum. Although FcalphaRI is an immunoglobulin Fc receptor (FcR), it differs in many ways from FcRs for other immunoglobulin classes. The genes of most FcRs are located on chromosome 1 at 1q21-23, whereas FcalphaRI is on chromosome 19, at 19q13.4, a region called the leukocyte receptor complex, because it is clustered with several leukocyte receptor families including killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) and leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LIRs). The amino acid sequence of FcalphaRI shares only 20% homology with other FcRs but it has around 35% homology with its neighboring LIRs and KIRs. In this work, we analyzed the crystal structure of the ectodomain of FcalphaRI and examined structure similarities between FcalphaRI and KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2 and LIR-1. Our data show that FcalphaRI, KIRs, and LIRs share a common hydrophobic core in their interdomain interface, and FcalphaRI is evolutionally closer to LIR than KIR.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,683,pos_MEDLINE,0.99720997,1

12823963,"Towards an understanding of the poliovirus replication complex: the solution structure of the soluble domain of the poliovirus 3A protein. Poliovirus is a positive-strand RNA virus and the prototypical member of the Picornaviridae family. Upon infection, the viral RNA genome is translated from a single open reading frame into a polypeptide which undergoes a series of cleavages to ultimately form four structural and seven non-structural proteins. A replication complex is then formed which replicates the viral genome into negative and positive strands for further translation, replication, and packaging into viral progeny. Poliovirus 3A protein (3A) is a critical component of the viral replication complex and is the putative target of enviroxime, an antiviral drug shown to block viral replication. 3A also inhibits host cell endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi apparatus transport, a function which may play a key role in viral evasion from the host immune response. 3A, an 87-residue protein consisting of a soluble N terminus and a hydrophobic C terminus, is formed by the cleavage of the precursor protein 3AB into 3A and 3B (VPg). Although they differ by only 22 residues, the precursor protein 3AB and its cleavage product 3A have distinct functions in viral replication. We have determined the structure of the soluble, N-terminal domain of 3A (3A-N) using NMR spectroscopy. We show that 3A-N exists as a symmetric dimer, and each monomer consists of an alpha-helical hairpin with unstructured, yet functional, N- and C termini. We also show that the 3A-N structure contains a negatively charged surface patch and provides a context for interpreting the biochemical characteristics of a number of previously reported 3A and 3AB mutants.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,696,pos_MEDLINE,0.99779594,1

12859184,"Catalytic mechanism of glycine N-methyltransferase. Methyltransfer reactions are some of the most important reactions in biological systems. Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) catalyzes the S-adenosyl-l-methionine- (SAM-) dependent methylation of glycine to form sarcosine. Unlike most SAM-dependent methyltransferases, GNMT has a relatively high value and is weakly inhibited by the product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH). The major role of GNMT is believed to be the regulation of the cellular SAM/SAH ratio, which is thought to play a key role in SAM-dependent methyltransfer reactions. Crystal structures of GNMT complexed with SAM and acetate (a potent competitive inhibitor of Gly) and the R175K mutated enzyme complexed with SAM were determined at 2.8 and 3.0 A resolutions, respectively. With these crystal structures and the previously determined structures of substrate-free enzyme, a catalytic mechanism has been proposed. Structural changes occur in the transitions from the substrate-free to the binary complex and from the binary to the ternary complex. In the ternary complex stage, an alpha-helix in the N-terminus undergoes a major conformational change. As a result, the bound SAM is firmly connected to protein and a ""Gly pocket"" is created near the bound SAM. The second substrate Gly binds to Arg175 and is brought into the Gly pocket. Five hydrogen bonds connect the Gly in the proximity of the bound SAM and orient the lone pair orbital on the amino nitrogen (N) of Gly toward the donor methyl group (C(E)) of SAM. Thermal motion of the enzyme leads to a collision of the N and C(E) so that a S(N)2 methyltransfer reaction occurs. The proposed mechanism is supported by mutagenesis studies.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,711,pos_MEDLINE,0.99603915,1
12860121,"Mutual induced fit binding of Xenopus ribosomal protein L5 to 5S rRNA. A library of random mutations in Xenopus ribosomal protein L5 was generated by error-prone PCR and used to delineate the binding domain for 5S rRNA. All but one of the amino acid substitutions that affected binding affinity are clustered in the central region of the protein. Several of the mutations are conservative substitutions of non-polar amino acid residues that are unlikely to form energetically significant contacts to the RNA. Thermal denaturation, monitored by circular dichroism (CD), indicates that L5 is not fully structured and association with 5S rRNA increases the t(m) of the protein by 16 degrees C. L5 induces changes in the CD spectrum of 5S rRNA, establishing that the complex forms by a mutual induced fit mechanism. Deuterium exchange reveals that a considerable amount of L5 is unstructured in the absence of 5S rRNA. The fluorescence emission of W266 provides evidence for structural changes in the C-terminal region of L5 upon binding to 5S rRNA; whereas, protection experiments demonstrate that the N terminus remains highly sensitive to protease digestion in the complex. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of L5 by the program PONDR predicts that the N and C-terminal regions of L5 are intrinsically disordered, but that the central region, which contains three essential tyrosine residues and other residues important for binding to 5S rRNA, is likely to be structured. Initial interaction of the protein with 5S rRNA likely occurs through this region, followed by induced folding of the C-terminal region. The persistent disorder in the N-terminal domain is possibly exploited for interactions between the L5-5S rRNA complex and other proteins.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,712,pos_MEDLINE,0.99601597,1

Isoforms of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) are 25 kDa homodimeric polypeptides that signal by binding and bringing together two related, functionally distinct cell surface receptors designated as TbetaR1 and TbetaR2. Here, we report the solution structure of the 13.8 kDa extracellular domain of human TbetaR2 (ecTbetaR2) as calculated from N(N)-H(N), C(alpha)-H(alpha), and C(alpha)-C(O) residual dipolar coupling restraints in conjunction with NOE distance, dihedral angle, and scalar coupling restraints. Comparison of the free ecTbetaR2 solution structure with the TGFbeta3-bound ecTbetaR2 crystal structure reveals backbone conformations that superimpose with RMSDs of 1.0 A over the regions of regular secondary structure and 1.4 A overall. The differences in structure fall mainly in loop regions that are either poorly defined by the available NMR data or are involved in crystal contacts. The noted similarities between the NMR structure of the free form and the crystal structure of the TGFbeta-bound form are also consistent with the close correspondence, 0.16 A RMSD for regions of secondary structure and 0.51 A RMSD overall, for the crystal structure of free ecTbetaR2 as compared to the crystal structure of TGFbeta3-bound ecTbetaR2. Despite the apparent similarities between the free and the bound forms, there appears to be small but significant differences in structure involving the interfacial contact region of the receptor. Measurements of backbone (15)N relaxation times and interpretation of these by the model-free formalism with axial diffusional anisotropy further reveal significant ms to micros time scale motions centered about two of the conserved disulfide bonds and in several residues that comprise the TGFbeta binding surface. Together, these observations indicate that binding likely occurs through a mechanism with a small component of induced fit character, whereby flexibility within the receptor facilitates the transition to the TGFbeta-bound state.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,733,pos_MEDLINE,0.9977083,1

The sema beta-propeller contains a distinctive 77-residue insertion between beta-strands C and D of blade 5. Blade 7 is followed by a domain common to plexins, semaphorins and integrins (PSI domain), which forms a compact cysteine knot abutting the side of the propeller, and an Ig-like domain. The top face of the beta-propeller presents prominent loops characteristic of semaphorins. In addition to limited contact between the Ig-like domains, the homodimer is stabilized through extensive interactions between the top faces in a sector of the beta-propeller used for heterodimerization in integrins.

12963368,"The role of RbfA in 16S rRNA processing and cell growth at low temperature in Escherichia coli. RbfA, a 30S ribosome-binding factor, is a multicopy suppressor of a cold-sensitive C23U mutation of the 16S rRNA and is required for efficient processing of the 16S rRNA. At 37 degrees C, DeltarbfA cells show accumulation of ribosomal subunits and 16S rRNA precursor with a significantly reduced polysome profile in comparison with wild-type cells. RbfA is also a cold-shock protein essential for Escherichia coli cells to adapt to low temperature. In this study, we examined its association with the ribosome and its role in 16S rRNA processing and ribosome profiles at low temperature. In wild-type cells, following cold shock at 15 degrees C, the amount of free RbfA remained largely stable, while that of its 30S subunit-associated form became several times greater than that at 37 degrees C and a larger fraction of total 30S subunits was detected to be RbfA-containing. In DeltarbfA cells, the pre-16S rRNA amount increased after cold shock with a concomitant reduction of the mature 16S rRNA amount and the formation of polysomes was further reduced. A closer examination revealed that 30S ribosomal subunits of DeltarbfA cells at low temperature contained primarily pre-16S rRNA and little mature 16S rRNA. Our results indicate that the cold sensitivity of DeltarbfA cells is directly related to their lack of translation initiation-capable 30S subunits containing mature 16S rRNA at low temperature. Importantly, when the C-terminal 25 residue sequence was deleted, the resulting RbfADelta25 lost the abilities to stably associate with the 30S subunit and to suppress the dominant-negative, cold-sensitive phenotype of the C23U mutation in 16S rRNA but was able to suppress the 16S rRNA processing defect and the cold-sensitive phenotype of the DeltarbfA cells, suggesting that RbfA may interact with the 30S ribosome at more than one site or function in more than one fashion in assisting the 16S rRNA maturation at low temperature.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,737,pos_MEDLINE,0.45963696,0

The determination of the NMR structure of oxidized Escherichia coli glutaredoxin in aqueous solution is described, and comparisons of this structure with that of reduced E. coli glutaredoxin and the related proteins E. coli thioredoxin and T4 glutaredoxin are presented. Based on nearly complete sequence-specific 1H-NMR assignments, 804 nuclear Overhauser enhancement distance constraints and 74 dihedral angle constraints were obtained as the input for the structure calculations, for which the distance geometry program DIANA was used followed by simulated annealing with the program X-PLOR. The molecular architecture of oxidized glutaredoxin is made up of three helices and a four-stranded beta-sheet. The three-dimensional structures of oxidized and the recently described reduced glutaredoxin are very similar. Quantitative analysis of the exchange rates of 34 slowly exchanging amide protons from corresponding series of two-dimensional [15N,1H]-correlated spectra of oxidized and reduced glutaredoxin showed close agreement, indicating almost identical hydrogen-bonding patterns. Nonetheless, differences in local dynamics involving residues near the active site and the C-terminal alpha-helix were clearly manifested. Comparison of the structure of E. coli glutaredoxin with those of T4 glutaredoxin and E. coli thioredoxin showed that all three proteins have a similar overall polypeptide fold.

The effects of dipotassium glycyrrhizinate (GLYK) on the dissolution behavior and bioavailability of amphotericin B (AMB) were investigated. The mixtures of AMB and GLYK were prepared at different molar ratios by lyophilization. Lyophilization resulted in amorphous AMB either alone or in the mixture. Dissolution rates of AMB of the mixtures were markedly faster than that of lyophilized AMB alone, which was followed by a decrease of dissolution. The initially-enhanced dissolution rate was likely to be due to the improvement of surface wettability of drug particles with GLYK rather than the amorphous state of AMB. A phase solubility study of AMB with GLYK indicated that the increasing solubility was caused by micellar solubilization. The in vitro release rate of AMB from suppositories containing the lyophilized mixtures was significantly accelerated by increasing the amount of GLYK. The rectal absorption of AMB from suppositories containing either the drug alone, a physical mixture or a lyophilized mixture was studied using rabbits. The absorption of the mixture (AMB/GLYK = 1/9) was about 35 times greater in the area under the serum concentration-time curve (0-24 h) than that of lyophilized AMB alone. These results suggest that GLYK is useful for improving the dissolution property of AMB and the bioavailability of the drug incorporated in suppositories.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,748,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.002157342,0
1403789,"A mechanistic study on enhancement of rectal permeability to insulin in the albino rabbit. This study was conducted mainly to investigate the relative contributions of various mechanisms by which bile salts and EDTA may improve the in vitro rectal penetration of insulin in the albino rabbit. Insulin could not cross the rectal mucosa unless Na glycocholate or other penetration enhancers were present. Penetration enhancement was attributed primarily to Na glycocholate's ability to reduce the barrier function of the rectal membrane and to increase the fraction of insulin in its monomeric form, and secondarily to Na glycocholate's ability to protect insulin from proteolysis. Na glycocholate was more effective than Na taurocholate, but less effective than Na deoxycholate and polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether in enhancing rectal insulin penetration. Although EDTA at 0.01 and 0.1% did not affect rectal insulin penetration, it augmented the penetration enhancement effect of 1% Na glycocholate without causing additional damage to the rectal membrane, as judged by protein release. Such an action was attributed to the synergistic effect associated with: 1) an increase in the permeability of the paracellular pathway by EDTA and 2) an increase in the proportion of insulin in the monomeric form by Na glycocholate. Results from parallel in vivo experiments have indicated that it may be possible to achieve significant penetration enhancement by using a combination of otherwise membrane-damaging penetration enhancers which act by complementary mechanisms at concentrations that are both effective and well tolerated by mucosal epithelial cells.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,752,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0025859366,0

Proteolytic mechanisms have been implicated in the process of ageing, and in many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, which are most prevalent in old age. Simple model organisms such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which offer the prowess of sophisticated genetic approaches, have contributed to our understanding of ageing and neurodegeneration. Intensive research in these systems has resulted in detailed models of the ageing process, and also of several neurodegenerative diseases, which recapitulate same aspects of the human pathologies. Inappropriate cell death is a major component of these and other devastating conditions such as stroke. The dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of cell degeneration in ageing is of utmost importance. Evidence from investigations in C. elegans implicates deregulated proteolysis as one major determinant of cellular destruction in neurodegeneration and ageing, and suggests that the process depends critically on the activation of calcium-dependent, calpain proteases and lysosomal aspartyl proteases.

Five measures of seed harvesting and caching behavior were assessed and used to calculate the effect of species on the probability of effective dispersal (i.e., movement of seeds to potential establishment sites) of piñon pine seeds. These measures were proportion of seeds harvested, proportion of harvested seeds that were scatter hoarded, relative dispersion of scatter-hoarded seeds, seedling emergence and seedling establishment. To evaluate the effects of the last two variables, a 2-year study of seed germination and seedling establishment was conducted in the field. Seedling survival was 72-90% for seedlings emerging from 1-4 cm deep but was markedly lower from surface caches and for depths >4 cm. All seedlings in the open microsite perished before the end of the first year, whereas 38-97% of seedlings under shrubs survived. Cache size did not affect seedling survival over the 2 years, but large caches reduced the total number of potential establishment sites. All six species harvested over 90% of the piñon seeds presented and scatter hoarded from 31% (pocket mouse) to 66% (chipmunk) of the seeds they harvested. Piñon mice and deer mice distributed seeds to more cache sites (i.e., put fewer seeds in caches) than the other species and, consequently, created more potential establishment sites. All species scatter hoarded seeds at depths suitable for seedling emergence, but pocket mice and piñon mice cached under shrubs more than the other species, the microhabitat where seedlings had the greatest probability of establishing.

We have carried out a domain analysis of POL32, the third subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase delta (Pol delta). Interactions with POL31, the second subunit of Pol delta, are specified by the amino-terminal 92 amino acids, whereas interactions with the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, POL30) reside at the extreme carboxyl-terminal region. Pol32 binding, in vivo and in vitro, to the large subunit of DNA polymerase alpha, POL1, requires the carboxyl-proximal region of Pol32. The amino-terminal region of Pol32 is essential for damage-induced mutagenesis. However, the presence of its carboxyl-terminal PCNA-binding domain enhances the efficiency of mutagenesis, particularly at high loads of DNA damage. In vitro, in the absence of effector DNA, the PCNA-binding domain of Pol32 is essential for PCNA-Pol delta interactions. However, this domain has minimal importance for processive DNA synthesis by the ternary DNA-PCNA-Pol delta complex. Rather, processivity is determined by PCNA-binding domains located in the Pol3 and/or Pol31 subunits.

Establishing a structural basis for understanding its reversible elasticity has proven to be difficult. Complementary to structure is the important aspect of flexibility and disorder in elastin. We have used solid-state NMR methods to examine polypeptide and hydrate ordering in both elastic (hydrated) and brittle (dry) elastin fibers and conclude (i) that tightly bound waters are absent in both dry and hydrated elastin and (ii) that the backbone in the hydrated protein is highly disordered with large amplitude motions. The hydrate was studied by (2)H and (17)O NMR, and the polypeptide by (13)C and (2)H NMR. Using a two-dimensional (13)C MAS method, an upper limit of S < 0.1 was determined for the backbone carbonyl group order parameter in hydrated elastin. For comparison, S approximately approximately 0.9 in most proteins. The former result is substantiated by two additional observations: the absence of the characteristic (2)H spectrum for stationary amides and ""solution-like"" (13)C magic angle spinning spectra at 75 degrees C, at which the material retains elasticity. Comparison of the observed shifts with accepted values for alpha-helices, beta-sheets, or random coils indicates a random coil structure at all carbons. These conclusions are discussed in the context of known thermodynamic properties of elastin and, more generally, protein folding. Because coacervation is an entropy-driven process, it is enhanced by the observed backbone disorder, which, we suggest, is the result of high proline content.

14690597,"The structure of the APPBP1-UBA3-NEDD8-ATP complex reveals the basis for selective ubiquitin-like protein activation by an E1. E1 enzymes initiate ubiquitin-like protein (ubl) transfer cascades by catalyzing adenylation of the ubl's C terminus. An E1's selectivity for its cognate ubl is essential because the E1 subsequently coordinates the ubl with its correct downstream pathway. We report here the structure of the 120 kDa quaternary complex between human APPBP1-UBA3, a heterodimeric E1, its ubl NEDD8, and ATP. The E1 selectively recruits NEDD8 through a bipartite interface, involving a domain common to all ubl activating enzymes including bacterial ancestors, and also eukaryotic E1-specific sequences. By modeling ubiquitin into the NEDD8 binding site and performing mutational analysis, we identify a single conserved arginine in APPBP1-UBA3 that acts as a selectivity gate, preventing misactivation of ubiquitin by NEDD8's E1. NEDD8 residues that interact with E1 correspond to residues in ubiquitin important for binding the proteasome and other ubiquitin-interacting proteins, suggesting that the conjugation and recognition machineries have coevolved for each specific ubl.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,828,pos_MEDLINE,0.99780446,1
14717591,"Effect of cofactor binding and loop conformation on side chain methyl dynamics in dihydrofolate reductase. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has several flexible active site loops that facilitate ligand binding and catalysis. Previous studies of backbone dynamics in several complexes of DHFR indicate that the time scale and amplitude of motion depend on the conformation of the active site loops. In this study, information on dynamics is extended to methyl-containing side chains. To understand the role of side chain dynamics in ligand binding and loop conformation, methyl deuterium relaxation rates of Escherichia coli DHFR in binary folate and ternary folate:NADP+ complexes have been measured, together with chi(1) rotamer populations for threonine, isoleucine, and valine residues, determined from measurements of 3J(CgammaCO) and 3J(CgammaN) coupling constants. The results indicate that, in addition to backbone motional restriction in the adenosine-binding site, side chain flexibility in the active site and the surrounding active site loops is diminished upon binding NADP+. Resonances for several methyls in the active site and the surrounding active site loops were severely broadened in the folate:NADP+ ternary complex, suggesting the presence of motion on the chemical shift time scale. The side chains of Ile14 and Ile94, which pack against the nicotinamide and pterin rings of the cofactor and substrate, respectively, exhibit rotamer disorder in the ternary folate:NADP+ complex. Conformational fluctuations of these side chains may play a role in transition state stabilization; the observed line broadening for Ile14 suggests motions on a microsecond/millisecond time scale.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,835,pos_MEDLINE,0.8086723,1
14735171,"Communication and information-giving in high-risk breast cancer consultations: influence on patient outcomes. Women who are concerned about their cancer risk because of their family history should have access to accurate information and referral for cancer genetic counselling (including risk estimation). While many studies have explored women's expectations of the session, their risk perceptions, their psychological state and their testing and screening intentions, there is little information on what happens in a genetic counselling session and how this process affects patient outcomes. Outcome studies in genetic counselling have largely relied on women's subjective assessment of the content and process of counselling, with few including an objective measure of what actually happened during the consultation. Furthermore, outcomes are often restricted to measures of satisfaction and understanding of risk. Such studies create a rather simplistic view of the goals of genetic counselling (Emery et al, 1972; Kessler, 1981). Furthermore, many of these studies did not evaluate the role of patient's sociodemographic factors (Evers Kiebooms and Van den Berghe, 1979; Marteau and Richards, 1996). The samples comprised women being counselled for a wide array of conditions, including chromosomal, autosomal recessive and a small proportion of autosomal dominant conditions, did not adequately control for or measure counsellor variability and used ad hoc measures of patient's input and outcome variables (Michie, 1993). The current study describes the process of genetic counselling for women from familial breast cancer families as shown by the analysis of audiotapes of counselling consultations. It examines the effect of different consultant communication styles on a variety of outcomes. It was hypothesised that the more the consultant facilitated communication and the more information was provided, the better would be patient outcomes; (a) higher knowledge; (b) more accurate risk perception; (c) higher total satisfaction, satisfaction with the information given and satisfaction that expectations were met; (d) more expectations being met; (e) lower generalised anxiety and depression; and (f) lower anxiety about breast cancer. METHODS. PARTICIPANTS. Women from high-risk breast cancer families who were attending their first consultation before genetic testing, in any one of 10 familial cancer clinics in four Australian States, were included in the study. Four clinical geneticists, one oncologist and two genetic counsellors conducted consultations. Women were quota-sampled according to whether or not they had previously had breast cancer. Women were considered ineligible for participation if they were unable to give informed consent, that is, if they were younger than 18 years or showed evidence of a severe mental illness. Individuals with limited literacy in English were also excluded because data collection was based on a self-administered questionnaire. None of the women had had a predictive test for, or was an obligate carrier of, a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Of the 231 women who met the eligibility criteria, 27 women did not attend their appointment and 11 declined participation. Of the remaining 193 women, 158 women completed baseline (and follow-up) questionnaires, for whom there was an audible audiotape of their consultation. A sample size of 158 women will detect a difference of 1.3 scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety subscale as a result of consultants’ communication with 82% power at a significance level of P=0.05. This difference corresponds to an effect size of 0.32 (i.e. a small to medium effect), according to Cohen's (1988) definition. PROCEDURE. This study is one component of a larger randomised controlled trial of providing women with an audiotape of their genetic counselling consultation (Lobb et al, 2002a), and the influence of patient characteristics on consultants’ communication (Lobb et al, 2002b). Staff at each of the participating clinics invited women to participate in the study (between November 1998 and May 2000) when they telephoned to make their appointment. If verbal agreement was obtained, women were mailed self-administered questionnaires 2 weeks before and 4 weeks after their genetic consultation. The consultations were audiotaped and copies of the audiotape were retained for analysis. Ethics approval was obtained from 10 different ethics committees prior to data collection. CODING OF TRANSCRIPTS OF AUDIOTAPES. A detailed coding system and manual for the transcribed audiotapes were devised. The transcripts were coded to capture 10 aspects of genetic counselling including (a) information giving concerning: (i) breast cancer genetics, (ii) genetic testing, (iii) family history and risk, (iv) prophylactic surgery, (v) breast cancer prevention, (vi) screening and management; (b) Communication style: including (vii) facilitating patient involvement, (viii) facilitating understanding, (ix) patient centredness and partnership building and (x) supportive and counselling communications. These categories were based on (a) the National Health & Medical Research Council's Guidelines on the Familial Aspects of Cancer: A Guide to Clinical Practice (NH&MRC, 1999) and (b) an Australian survey of clinical geneticists/genetic counsellors describing their practice (Lobb et al, 2001) and (c) studies that identified women's expectations of the genetic counselling session (Julian-Reynier et al, 1996, 1998; Hallowell et al, 1997; Michie et al, 1997; Veach et al, 1999; Brain et al, 2000). Under each of these categories, the content or types of communication that characterised that issue were identified. The presence or absence of each component was coded. Whether the woman or the consultant initiated the content was noted and, finally, the actual words used were recorded. An example of coding for an information variable is shown in Table 1,.

Tau protein, a neuronal microtubule-associated protein, forms insoluble fibers (""paired helical filaments"") in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Conflicting views on the structure of the fibers have been proposed recently, ranging from mainly alpha-helical structure to mainly beta-sheet, or a mixture of mostly random coil and beta-sheet. We have addressed this issue by studying tau fibers immunopurified from Alzheimer brain tissue by a conformation-specific antibody and comparing them with fibers reassembled from recombinant tau or tau constructs in vitro, using a combination of electron microscopy and spectroscopic methods. Brain-derived fibers and reassembled fibers both exhibit a typical twisted appearance when examined by electron microscopy. The soluble tau protein is a natively unfolded protein dominated by random coil structure, whereas Alzheimer PHFs and reassembled fibers show a shift toward an increase in the level of beta-structure. The results support a model in which the repeat domain of tau (which lies within the core of PHFs) adopts an increasing level of beta-structure during aggregation, whereas the N- and C-terminal domains projecting away from the PHF core are mostly random coil.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,852,pos_MEDLINE,0.9934738,1

Traditionally, evaluations of nonculture assays for Chlamydia trachomatis are based on a comparison with urethral culture in men and cervical culture in women as the standard for positivity of infection, but it is known that culture may be less than 100% sensitive. A chemiluminometric immunoassay, Magic Lite (Ciba Corning, Medfield, MA) that detects C. trachomatis antigens was performed on centrifuged first void urine samples and urethral swabs collected from men attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic. Immunoassay performance was compared to urethral culture and also to a broader gold standard: an infected patient with positive culture results or a confirmed positive Chlamydiazyme enzyme immunoassay (Abbott, Chicago) result. Two studies were performed on a retrospective group of stored first void urine samples from 200 men and a prospective group of urethral swabs and first void urine samples from 199 men. Expanding the gold standard showed that a urethral swab assayed by culture had a sensitivity between 70.3% and 87.5%, with the following effects on immunoassay performance in the prospective study: the sensitivity of urethral swabbing was reduced from 96.2% to 78.4% (specificity increased from 96.0% to 98.1%) and first void urine sensitivity increased from 92.3% to 94.6% (specificity went from 87.9% to 93.8%). In the retrospective study, sensitivity of first void urine testing went from 91.4% to 92.5%, with a corresponding increase in specificity from 93.9% to 96.9%.

PURPOSE Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). As a result of a breakdown of the blood-retina barrier, growth factors obtain access to the subretinal space and stimulate several retinal cell types. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of several growth factors on the proliferation of human (h)RPE cells, and on the mRNA expression of transcription factors, cell cycle proteins, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. METHODS hRPE cells were incubated in the presence of TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, PDGF, VEGF, or bFGF for 24-72 h. Cell proliferation was assessed by determinating BrdU incorporation. Changes in mRNA expression of c-fos, c-myc, PCNA, FEN1, Ki67, collagen III, and collagen IV were investigated by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA). RESULTS RPE cell proliferation was significantly increased by exposure to PDGF and bFGF for 48 h, and was decreased by application of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 for 48 and 72 h. All the tested growth factors significantly elevated the amounts of c-fos mRNA (after 1 h) and of c-myc mRNA (after 24 h). PDGF and bFGF up-regulated the expression of Ki67 mRNA, and down-regulated that of collagen III and collagen IV mRNA after 24 h. TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 decreased the expression of Ki67 mRNA, and increased that of collagen III and collagen IV mRNA. CONCLUSION Our results show that distinct cytokines may induce contrary effects with respect to proliferation of, and ECM formation by, hRPE cells in vitro.

14980206,"Structural insights into the functional interaction of KChIP1 with Shal-type K(+) channels. Four Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIP1 through KChIP4) interact directly with the N-terminal domain of three Shal-type voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv4.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3) to modulate cell surface expression and function of Kv4 channels. Here we report a 2.0 Angstrom crystal structure of the core domain of KChIP1 (KChIP1*) in complex with the N-terminal fragment of Kv4.2 (Kv4.2N30). The complex reveals a clam-shaped dimeric assembly. Four EF-hands from each KChIP1 form each shell of the clam. The N-terminal end of Kv4.2 forming an alpha helix (alpha1) and the C-terminal alpha helix (H10) of KChIP1 are enclosed nearly coaxially by these shells. As a result, the H10 of KChIP1 and alpha1 of Kv4.2 mediate interactions between these two molecules, structurally reminiscent of the interactions between calmodulin and its target peptides. Site-specific mutagenesis combined with functional characterization shows that those interactions mediated by alpha1 and H10 are essential to the modulation of Kv4.2 by KChIPs.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,866,pos_MEDLINE,0.9978594,1

Autotransporters are virulence-related proteins of Gram-negative bacteria that are secreted via an outer-membrane-based C-terminal extension, the translocator domain.

We present here the crystal structure of the in vitro-folded translocator domain of the autotransporter NalP from Neisseria meningitidis, which reveals a 12-stranded beta-barrel with a hydrophilic pore of 10 x 12.5 A that is filled by an N-terminal alpha-helix. The domain has pore activity in vivo and in vitro. Our data are consistent with the model of passenger-domain transport through the hydrophilic channel within the beta-barrel, and inconsistent with a model for transport through a central channel formed by an oligomer of translocator domains. However, the dimensions of the pore imply translocation of the secreted domain in an unfolded form.

Abeta interacts with ABAD in the mitochondria of AD patients and transgenic mice. The crystal structure of Abeta-bound ABAD shows substantial deformation of the active site that prevents nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) binding. An ABAD peptide specifically inhibits ABAD-Abeta interaction and suppresses Abeta-induced apoptosis and free-radical generation in neurons.

A growth inhibition activity was also observed with (N)-MCT and ganciclovir in non-transduced cells in a cell line-dependent manner, whereas TK(-) cells were not affected. The presented 1.95-A crystal structure of the complex (S)-MCT.HSV1 TK explains both the more favorable binding affinity and catalytic turnover of (S)-MCT for HSV1 TK over the North analog.

15170335,"Solution structure of a methionine-rich 2S albumin from sunflower seeds: relationship to its allergenic and emulsifying properties. The three-dimensional structure in aqueous solution of SFA-8, a 2S albumin 103-residue protein from seeds of sunflower (Helianthus anuus L.), has been determined by NMR methods. An almost complete (1)H resonance assignment was accomplished from analysis of two-dimensional (2D) COSY and 2D TOCSY spectra, and the structure was computed by using restrained molecular dynamics on the basis of 1393 upper limit distance constraints derived from NOE cross-correlation intensities measured in 2D NOESY spectra. In contrast with most other 2S albumins, SFA-8 consists of a single polypeptide chain without any cleavage in the segment of residues 30-46. The computed structures exhibited an rmsd radius of 0.52 A for the backbone structural core (residues 11-30 and 46-101) and 1.01 A for the side chain heavy atoms. The resulting structure consists of five amphipathic helices arranged in a right-handed superhelix, a folding motif first observed in nonspecific lipid transfer (nsLTP) proteins, and common to other 2S albumins. In contrast to nsLTP proteins, neither SFA-8 nor RicC3 (a 2S albumin from castor bean) has an internal cavity that is able to host a lipid molecule, which results from an exchange in the pairing of disulfide bridges in the CXC segment. Both 2S albumins and nonspecific lipid transfer proteins belong to the prolamin superfamily, which includes a number of important food allergens. Differences in the extension and solvent exposition of the so-called ""hypervariable loop"" (which connects helices III and IV) in SFA-8 and RicC3 may be responsible for the different allergenic properties of the two proteins. SFA-8 has been shown to form highly stable emulsions with oil/water mixtures. We propose that these properties may be determined partly by a hydrophobic patch at the surface of the protein which consists of five methionines that partially hide the Trp76 residue.

15242592,"West Nile virus core protein; tetramer structure and ribbon formation. INTRODUCTION. West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging, mosquito-borne human pathogen that first appeared in the U.S. in 1999 (Brinton, 2002) and currently constitutes a serious health threat, with 264 registered deaths and 9858 reported cases in 2003 (CDC, 2004). Sporadic outbreaks have also occurred in Europe, and the virus has been isolated from birds in the UK (Buckley et al., 2003). Typical symptoms of WNV infection include fever, rashes, and myalgia; however, occasionally more severe and potentially fatal symptoms develop, including acute encephalitis and fulminant hepatitis (Petersen et al., 2003). WNV are divided into two lineages: lineage 1 includes the New York strain (NY99) responsible for the recent outbreaks in the U.S., as well as the closely related Kunjin virus, which was recently classified as an Australian subtype of WNV Lanciotti et al. 1999, Scherret et al. 2001. Unlike the highly pathogenic NY99 strain, humans infected with Kunjin virus do not develop the more severe symptoms (Hall et al., 2003). Lineage 2 consists of several African strains, which are apparently not involved in outbreaks of the disease (Lanciotti et al., 1999). There is currently no vaccine available, but inoculation with a cDNA for the whole genome of an attenuated form of Kunjin virus could confer resistance to infection by the NY99 strain of WNV in mice (Hall et al., 2003). WNV is a member of the Flaviviridae family, which includes many important human pathogens, like dengue, yellow fever, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), and hepatitis C viruses (Strauss and Strauss, 2002). The flaviviruses have a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome, containing one large open reading frame, which is translated as a single polyprotein (Lindenbach and Rice, 2002). The 3433 amino acid polyprotein of WNV is cleaved by host and viral proteases to the three structural proteins, C (core), prM (membrane), and E (envelope), and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (Brinton, 2002). In the virion, the genome is contained within a spherical or isometric nucleocapsid or core made from the C protein. The 123 amino acid C precursor is targeted to the membrane by a carboxy-terminal hydrophobic sequence and is cleaved to its mature 105 residue form by the viral NS2B-NS3 protease. The core is surrounded by a lipid membrane containing the two membrane proteins prM and E (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2003). Particle maturation involves cleavage of pre-M to M and resulting reorganization of the E proteins from a dimeric to a trimeric arrangement Kuhn et al. 2002, Zhang et al. 2003. Cryo-electron microscopy (EM) reconstruction of WNV (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2003) showed an outer envelope layer consisting of 180 copies of E protein, very similar to that of dengue virus Kuhn et al. 2002, Zhang et al. 2003. Consequently, the WNV E protein is presumed to have a similar structure to the E protein of dengue virus and TBE Modis et al. 2003, Rey et al. 1995. The EM reconstructions of WNV and dengue virus did not show any structure for the inner core, however, presumably due to its being disordered or having different symmetry from the envelope. There are only four amino acid differences (out of 105) in the mature C protein between Kunjin virus and the NY99 strain of WNV and seven differences between Kunjin virus and a Nigerian strain, a member of WNV lineage 2 (Figure 1) . Dengue virus C protein shares about 57% identity with WNV. The WNV C protein contains a large number of positively charged residues, which are distributed throughout the protein, unlike the core proteins of togaviruses and arteriviruses, which have distinct, positively charged N-terminal regions Choi et al. 1991, Doan and Dokland 2003. The N-terminal and C-terminal charged regions have both been implicated in RNA binding (Khromykh and Westaway, 1996). The dengue virus C protein was recently solved by NMR methods (Ma et al., 2004). It forms a dimer in solution and contains four α helices. The N-terminal 20 or so residues were disordered, similar to the RNA binding regions of togaviruses and arteriviruses. Here, we report the crystal structure of the C protein from the Kunjin subtype of WNV. This is the first crystal structure of a flavivirus core protein. The C protein forms dimers, similar to those of dengue virus C, which are organized into tetramers with highly positively charged surfaces. The α helices in the tetramers stack up to form long filamentous ribbons in the crystal. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. The first 103 amino acids of the C protein of Kunjin virus (strain MRM61C) were cloned with an N-terminal 6×His tag and purified by affinity and ion exchange chromatography. Crystals of the full-length C protein were unstable and disordered and did not diffract X-rays to high resolution. Assuming that the crystal disorder was caused by flexible regions in the protein, we treated the full-length protein with trypsin, resulting in a stable fragment starting at Val23 and ending at Arg98 (Figure 1). This fragment yielded stable crystals which diffracted synchrotron radiation anisotropically to about 2.8 Å resolution. The crystals belong to space group I41 with a = 85.7 Å and c = 214.4 Å, with eight protein monomers in the asymmetric unit and VM = 2.8. The structure was solved to 3.2 Å resolution by MAD on a Se-Met derivative, giving a final Rcryst = 0.25 and Rfree = 0.31 (Table 1) and has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 1SFK (Figures 2A and 2B) . The C protein structure consists of four α helices interspersed by short loops Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 . The protein forms a tight 2-fold symmetric dimer, in which the helices α1, α2, and α4 form three distinct “layers” and α3 forms a short, connecting helix flanking the dimer (Figure 3A).

Ole e 6 is a pollen protein from the olive tree (Olea europaea) that exhibits allergenic activity with a high prevalence among olive-allergic individuals. The three-dimensional structure of Ole e 6 has been determined in solution by NMR methods. This is the first experimentally determined structure of an olive tree pollen allergen. The structure of this 50-residue protein is based on 486 upper limit distance constraints derived from nuclear Overhauser effects and 24 torsion angle restraints. The global fold of Ole e 6 consists of two nearly antiparallel alpha-helices, spanning residues 3-19 and 23-33, that are connected by a short loop and followed by a long, unstructured C-terminal tail. Viewed edge-on, the structured N terminus has a dumbbell-like shape with the two helices on the outside and with the hydrophobic core, mainly composed of 3 aromatic and 6 cysteine residues, on the inside. All the aromatic rings lie on top of and pack against the three disulfide bonds. The lack of thermal unfolding, even at 85 degrees C, indicates a high conformational stability. Based on the analysis of the molecular surface, we propose five plausible epitopes for IgE recognition. The results presented here provide the structural foundation for future experiments to verify the antigenicity of the proposed epitopes, as well as to design novel hypoallergenic forms of the protein suitable for diagnosis and treatment of type-I allergies.

Point mutations that disrupt the dimerization abolish interaction with Cdt1 and inhibition of replication. An array of glutamic acid residues on the coiled-coil domain surface interacts with positive charges in the middle of Cdt1. An adjoining region interacts independently with the N-terminal 100 residues of Cdt1. Both interactions are essential for replication inhibition. The negative residues on the coiled-coil domain and a different part of geminin are also required for interaction with HoxA11. Therefore a rigid cylinder with negative surface charges is a critical component of a bipartite interaction interface between geminin and its cellular targets.,MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,965,pos_MEDLINE,0.99694854,1
15286659,"Structural basis for inhibition of the replication licensing factor Cdt1 by geminin. To maintain chromosome stability in eukaryotic cells, replication origins must be licensed by loading mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM2-7) complexes once and only once per cell cycle. This licensing control is achieved through the activities of geminin and cyclin-dependent kinases. Geminin binds tightly to Cdt1, an essential component of the replication licensing system, and prevents the inappropriate reinitiation of replication on an already fired origin. The inhibitory effect of geminin is thought to prevent the interaction between Cdt1 and the MCM helicase. Here we describe the crystal structure of the mouse geminin-Cdt1 complex using tGeminin (residues 79-157, truncated geminin) and tCdt1 (residues 172-368, truncated Cdt1). The amino-terminal region of a coiled-coil dimer of tGeminin interacts with both N-terminal and carboxy-terminal parts of tCdt1. The primary interface relies on the steric complementarity between the tGeminin dimer and the hydrophobic face of the two short N-terminal helices of tCdt1 and, in particular, Pro 181, Ala 182, Tyr 183, Phe 186 and Leu 189. The crystal structure, in conjunction with our biochemical data, indicates that the N-terminal region of tGeminin might be required to anchor tCdt1, and the C-terminal region of tGeminin prevents access of the MCM complex to tCdt1 through steric hindrance.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,970,pos_MEDLINE,0.9978677,1
15321719,"Structures of Michaelis and product complexes of plant cytokinin dehydrogenase: implications for flavoenzyme catalysis. Cytokinins form a diverse class of compounds that are essential for plant growth. Cytokinin dehydrogenase has a major role in the control of the levels of these plant hormones by catalysing their irreversible oxidation. The crystal structure of Zea mays cytokinin dehydrogenase displays the same two-domain topology of the flavoenzymes of the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase family but its active site cannot be related to that of any other family member. The X-ray analysis reveals a bipartite architecture of the catalytic centre, which consists of a funnel-shaped region on the protein surface and an internal cavity lined by the flavin ring. A pore with diameter of about 4A connects the two active-site regions. Snapshots of two critical steps along the reaction cycle were obtained through the structural analysis of the complexes with a slowly reacting substrate and the reaction product, which correspond to the states immediately before (Michaelis complex) and after (product complex) oxidation has taken place. The substrate displays a ""plug-into-socket"" binding mode that seals the catalytic site and precisely positions the carbon atom undergoing oxidation in close contact with the reactive locus of the flavin. A polarising H-bond between the substrate amine group and an Asp-Glu pair may facilitate oxidation. Substrate to product conversion results in small atomic movements, which lead to a planar conformation of the reaction product allowing double-bond conjugation. These features in the mechanism of amine recognition and oxidation differ from those observed in other flavin-dependent amine oxidases.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,982,pos_MEDLINE,0.9968702,1

Mammalian cells produce a variety of inositol phosphates (InsPs), including Ins(1,4,5)P3 that serves both as a second messenger and as a substrate for inositol polyphosphate kinases (IPKs), which further phosphorylate it. We report the structure of an IPK, the human Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase-A, both free and in complexes with substrates and products. This enzyme catalyzes transfer of a phosphate from ATP to the 3-OH of Ins(1,4,5)P3, and its X-ray crystal structure provides a template for understanding a broad family of InsP kinases. The catalytic domain consists of three lobes. The N and C lobes bind ATP and resemble protein and lipid kinases, despite insignificant sequence similarity. The third lobe binds inositol phosphate and is a unique four-helix insertion in the C lobe. This lobe embraces all of the phosphates of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in a positively charged pocket, explaining the enzyme's substrate specificity and its inability to phosphorylate PtdIns(4,5)P2, the membrane-resident analog of Ins(1,4,5)P3.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,994,pos_MEDLINE,0.99769044,1
15356567,"Randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing desloratadine and montelukast in monotherapy and desloratadine plus montelukast in combined therapy for chronic idiopathic urticaria. BACKGROUND H 1 -receptor antagonists are considered to be particularly effective in reducing pruritus, and they are therefore recommended as first-line treatment in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). Recently, antileukotriene receptors have been used in patients with CIU, either administered as monotherapy or combined with H 1 -receptor antagonists. OBJECTIVE We compared the clinical efficacy of 5 mg of desloratadine administered once daily either as monotherapy or combined with a leukotriene antagonist, 10 mg of montelukast daily, and 10 mg of montelukast administered daily as monotherapy for the treatment of patients affected by CIU with placebo. METHODS One hundred sixty patients aged 18 to 69 years (mean +/- SD, 43.9 +/- 13.4 years) with a history of moderate CIU were selected. A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study design was used. Patients were treated with 5 mg of desloratadine once daily (n = 40), 10 mg of montelukast once daily (n = 40), 5 mg of desloratadine (n = 40) in the morning plus montelukast in the evening, or matched placebo (n = 40). Assessment of treatment efficacy was based on scores of daily cutaneous symptoms evaluated reflectively and instantaneously. RESULTS Only the group treated with desloratadine as monotherapy or as combined therapy concluded the whole study. Twenty-seven of the 40 patients in the montelukast group and 35 of the 40 patients in the placebo group discontinued the treatment. As reflective evaluation, all groups showed significant differences compared with the placebo group in terms of total symptom score, number of hives, and size of largest hive. In addition to the pruritus, only the groups treated with desloratadine as monotherapy or combined therapy showed significant differences compared with those receiving placebo, whereas there were no differences between the montelukast and placebo groups. Finally, no differences were found between the desloratadine group and the desloratadine plus montelukast group. The instantaneous evaluation demonstrated similar results regarding the desloratadine group and the desloratadine plus montelukast group versus the placebo group, whereas there were no significant differences between the group treated with montelukast alone and the placebo group for pruritus and size of largest hive. No differences were found between the group treated with desloratadine alone and the desloratadine plus montelukast group. CONCLUSIONS The results of this comparative study demonstrate that desloratadine is highly effective for the treatment of patients affected by CIU. In addition, the regular combined therapy of desloratadine plus montelukast does not seem to offer a substantial advantage with respect to desloratadine as monotherapy in patients affected by moderate CIU.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,996,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0024391296,0

15373405,"Effect of different soil textures on leaching potential and degradation of pesticides in biobeds. Biobeds can be used to intercept pesticide-contaminated runoff from the mixing/washdown area, creating optimum conditions for sorption and biodegradation such that the amount of pesticide reaching adjacent water bodies is significantly reduced. The biobed is built on the farm using locally available materials, which include, straw, compost, and topsoil. The topsoil acts as the inoculum for the system and is likely to vary in terms of its physical, chemical, and microbiological characteristics from one farm to another. This study therefore investigated the effects of using different soil types on the degradation and leaching potential from biobeds. Three contrasting topsoils were investigated. Leaching studies were performed using isoproturon, dimethoate, and mecoprop-P, which were applied at simulated disposal rates to 1.5 m deep biobeds. Annual average concentrations were similar for each soil type with leaching losses of even the most mobile (Koc = 12-25) pesticide <1.64% of the applied dose. Greater than 98% of the retained pesticides were degraded in all matrices. Degradation studies investigated the persistence of individual pesticides and pesticide mixtures in the different matrices. DT50 values for isoproturon, chlorothalonil, mecoprop-P, and metsulfuron-methyl applied at 4 times the maximum approved rate were similar across the biomix types and were all less than or equal to reported DT50 values for soil treated at approved rates. When applied as a mixture, DT50 values in each biomix increased, indicating that interactions between pesticides are possible. However, DT90 values of <167 days were obtained in all circumstances, indicating a negligible risk of accumulation. Studies therefore indicate that substrate will have little impact on biobed performance so it should be possible to use local soils in the construction process.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1002,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.002463007,0

Soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) catalyzes the hydroxylation of methane by dioxygen to methanol, the first step in carbon assimilation by methanotrophs. This multicomponent system transfers electrons from NADH through a reductase component to the non-heme diiron center in the hydroxylase where O(2) is activated. The reductase component comprises three distinct domains, a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin domain along with FAD- and NADH-binding domains. We report the solution structure of the reduced 27.6 kDa FAD- and NADH-binding domains (MMOR-FAD) of the reductase from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). The FAD-binding domain consists of a six-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel and one alpha-helix, with the first 10 N-terminal residues unstructured. In the interface between the two domains, the FAD cofactor is tightly bound in an unprecedented extended conformation. The NADH-binding domain consists of a five-stranded parallel beta-sheet with four alpha-helices packing closely around this sheet. MMOR-FAD is structurally homologous to other FAD-containing oxidoreductases, and we expect similar structures for the FAD/NADH-binding domains of reductases that occur in other multicomponent monooxygenases.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1005,pos_MEDLINE,0.99766773,1
15448165,"Myristoylation, a protruding loop, and structural plasticity are essential features of a nonenveloped virus fusion peptide motif. Members of the fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein family are a distinct class of membrane fusion proteins encoded by nonenveloped fusogenic reoviruses. The 125-residue p14 FAST protein of reptilian reovirus has an approximately 38-residue myristoylated N-terminal ectodomain containing a moderately apolar N-proximal region, termed the hydrophobic patch. Mutagenic analysis indicated sequence-specific elements in the N-proximal portion of the p14 hydrophobic patch affected cell-cell fusion activity, independent of overall effects on the relative hydrophobicity of the motif. Circular dichroism (CD) of a myristoylated peptide representing the majority of the p14 ectodomain suggested this region is mostly disordered in solution but assumes increased structure in an apolar environment. From NMR spectroscopic data and simulated annealing, the soluble nonmyristoylated p14 ectodomain peptide consists of an N-proximal extended loop flanked by two proline hinges. The remaining two-thirds of the ectodomain peptide structure is disordered, consistent with predictions based on CD spectra of the myristoylated peptide. The myristoylated p14 ectodomain peptide, but not a nonmyristoylated version of the same peptide nor a myristoylated scrambled peptide, mediated extensive lipid mixing in a liposome fusion assay. Based on the lipid mixing activity, structural plasticity, environmentally induced conformational changes, and kinked structures predicted for the p14 ectodomain and hydrophobic patch (all features associated with fusion peptides), we propose that the majority of the p14 ectodomain is composed of a fusion peptide motif, the first such motif dependent on myristoylation for membrane fusion activity.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1009,pos_MEDLINE,0.9975751,1

Proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) catalyzes the first step of proline catabolism, the flavin-dependent oxidation of proline to Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate. Here we present a structure-based study of the PRODH active site of the multifunctional Escherichia coli proline utilization A (PutA) protein using X-ray crystallography, enzyme kinetic measurements, and site-directed mutagenesis. Structures of the PutA PRODH domain complexed with competitive inhibitors acetate (K(i) = 30 mM), L-lactate (K(i) = 1 mM), and L-tetrahydro-2-furoic acid (L-THFA, K(i) = 0.2 mM) have been determined to high-resolution limits of 2.1-2.0 A. The discovery of acetate as a competitive inhibitor suggests that the carboxyl is the minimum functional group recognized by the active site, and the structures show how the enzyme exploits hydrogen-bonding and nonpolar interactions to optimize affinity for the substrate. The PRODH/L-THFA complex is the first structure of PRODH with a five-membered ring proline analogue bound in the active site and thus provides new insights into substrate recognition and the catalytic mechanism. The ring of L-THFA is nearly parallel to the middle ring of the FAD isoalloxazine, with the inhibitor C5 atom 3.3 A from the FAD N5. This geometry suggests direct hydride transfer as a plausible mechanism. Mutation of conserved active site residue Leu432 to Pro caused a 5-fold decrease in k(cat) and a severe loss in thermostability. These changes are consistent with the location of Leu432 in the hydrophobic core near residues that directly contact FAD. Our results suggest that the molecular basis for increased plasma proline levels in schizophrenic subjects carrying the missense mutation L441P is due to decreased stability of human PRODH2.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1010,pos_MEDLINE,0.9976265,1
15465854,"SAXS study of the PIR domain from the Grb14 molecular adaptor: a natively unfolded protein with a transient structure primer?. Grb14 belongs to the Grb7 family of adapters and was identified as a negative regulator of insulin signal transduction. Between the PH (pleckstrin homology) and SH2 (Src homology 2) domains is a new binding domain implicated in the interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases called PIR (phosphorylated insulin receptor interaction region). Both PIR and SH2 domains interact with the insulin receptor, but their relative role varies considering the member of the Grb7 family and the tyrosine kinase receptor. In the case of Grb14, PIR is the main binding domain and is sufficient to inhibit the insulin receptor kinase activity. We have proposed, on the basis of NMR measurements, that PIR lacks ordered structure and presents a high flexibility, although remaining fully active. To complement this first study, we have used small-angle x-ray scattering in solution together with a modeling approach representing the PIR domain as a chain of pseudo residues. Circular dichroism experiments were also performed in the presence of variable amounts of trifluoroethanol. These observations, together with an ensemble of sequence analyses and previous NMR results, all support the view of PIR as essentially unstructured but with a potentially structured short stretch encompassing residues 399-407. This stretch, which may be only structured transiently in the isolated molecule, could play a major role in Grb14 PIR binding to a biological partner by undergoing a structural transition.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1017,pos_MEDLINE,0.99801993,1

ESCRT-I, -II, and -III protein complexes are sequentially recruited to endosomal membranes, where they orchestrate protein sorting and MVB biogenesis. In addition, they play a critical role in retrovirus budding. Structural understanding of ESCRT interaction networks is largely lacking. The 3.6 A structure of the yeast ESCRT-II core presented here reveals a trilobal complex containing two copies of Vps25, one copy of Vps22, and the C-terminal region of Vps36. Unexpectedly, the entire ESCRT-II core consists of eight repeats of a common building block, a ""winged helix"" domain. Two PPXY-motifs from Vps25 are involved in contacts with Vps22 and Vps36, and their mutation leads to ESCRT-II disruption. We show that purified ESCRT-II binds directly to the Vps20 component of ESCRT-III. Surprisingly, this binding does not require the protruding N-terminal coiled-coil of Vps22. Vps25 is the chief subunit responsible for Vps20 recruitment.

We have determined the structure of bovine rhodopsin at 2.65 A resolution using untwinned native crystals in the space group P3(1), by molecular replacement from the 2.8 A model (1F88) solved in space group P4(1). The new structure reveals mechanistically important details unresolved previously, which are considered in the membrane context by docking the structure into a cryo-electron microscopy map of 2D crystals. Kinks in the transmembrane helices facilitate inter-helical polar interactions. Ordered water molecules extend the hydrogen bonding networks, linking Trp265 in the retinal binding pocket to the NPxxY motif near the cytoplasmic boundary, and the Glu113 counterion for the protonated Schiff base to the extracellular surface. Glu113 forms a complex with a water molecule hydrogen bonded between its main chain and side-chain oxygen atoms. This can be expected to stabilise the salt-bridge with the protonated Schiff base linking the 11-cis-retinal to Lys296. The cytoplasmic ends of helices H5 and H6 have been extended by one turn. The G-protein interaction sites mapped to the cytoplasmic ends of H5 and H6 and a spiral extension of H5 are elevated above the bilayer. There is a surface cavity next to the conserved Glu134-Arg135 ion pair. The cytoplasmic loops have the highest temperature factors in the structure, indicative of their flexibility when not interacting with G protein or regulatory proteins. An ordered detergent molecule is seen wrapped around the kink in H6, stabilising the structure around the potential hinge in H6. These findings provide further explanation for the stability of the dark state structure. They support a mechanism for the activation, initiated by photo-isomerisation of the chromophore to its all-trans form, that involves pivoting movements of kinked helices, which, while maintaining hydrophobic contacts in the membrane interior, can be coupled to amplified translation of the helix ends near the membrane surfaces.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1022,pos_MEDLINE,0.9970765,1
15501466,"A general solution for optimal egg size during external fertilization, extended scope for intermediate optimal egg size and the introduction of Don Ottavio 'tango'. Egg sizes of marine invertebrates vary greatly, both within and between species. Among the proposed causes of this are a trade-off between egg size, egg number and survival probability of offspring, and a selection pressure exerted by sperm limitation during external fertilization. Although larger eggs are indeed a larger target for sperm, producing larger eggs also implies making fewer of them. There has been discussion about whether sperm limitation can (theoretically) and does (in nature) select for larger egg size than under ad libitum sperm. In one specific model, based on a particular fertilization kinetics model and an empirically derived mortality function, the theoretical possibility of a negative shift in optimal egg size with sperm concentration was demonstrated. Here we present a generalized analytical model to explore the effects of survival and fertilization probabilities on optimal egg size. It is demonstrated that incorporating fertilization kinetics greatly increases the scope for intermediate optimal egg size, as opposed to eggs of minimal or maximal size. Second, we present a general analytical qualitative solution to the question whether optimal egg size depends on sperm concentration. It is shown that, under the condition that an intermediate optimal egg size exists, this qualitative outcome of the model (positive, negative or no relation between optimal egg size and sperm limitation) depends on the structure of the fertilization kinetics part of the model. Finally, we evaluate fertilization kinetics models with respect to the general solution, using two previously published kinetics models ('Don Giovanni' and 'Don Ottavio') and a novel alteration of one of them in which sperm concentration covaries with egg concentration (Don Ottavio 'tango'). For all three models the relationship between optimal egg size and sperm concentration is shown to be always negative. This paper thus shows how biologically realistic relationships between egg size on the one hand and survival and fertilization probability on the other hand predict optimal egg size to be intermediate, and that this optimum is in general expected to increase when sperm become more limiting.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1024,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0020507437,0

Decorin is a ubiquitous extracellular matrix proteoglycan with a variety of important biological functions that are mediated by its interactions with extracellular matrix proteins, cytokines, and cell surface receptors. Decorin is the prototype of the family of small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans and proteins (SLRPs), characterized by a protein core composed of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), flanked by two cysteine-rich regions. We report here the crystal structure of the dimeric protein core of decorin, the best characterized member of the SLRP family. Each monomer adopts the curved solenoid fold characteristic of LRR domains, with a parallel beta-sheet on the inside interwoven with loops containing short segments of beta-strands, 3(10) helices, and polyproline II helices on the outside. Two main features are unique to this structure. First, decorin dimerizes through the concave surfaces of the LRR domains, which have been implicated previously in protein-ligand interactions. The amount of surface buried in this dimer rivals the buried surfaces of some of the highest-affinity macromolecular complexes reported to date. Second, the C-terminal region adopts an unusual capping motif that involves a laterally extended LRR and a disulfide bond.

The variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of African trypanosomes has a structural role in protecting other cell surface proteins from effector molecules of the mammalian immune system and also undergoes antigenic variation necessary for a persistent infection in a host. Here we have reported the solution structure of a VSG type 2 C-terminal domain from MITat1.2, completing the first structure of both domains of a VSG. The isolated C-terminal domain is a monomer in solution and forms a novel fold, which commences with a short alpha-helix followed by a single turn of 3(10)-helix and connected by a short loop to a small anti-parallel beta-sheet and then a longer alpha-helix at the C terminus. This compact domain is flanked by two unstructured regions. The structured part of the domain contains 42 residues, and the core comprises 2 disulfide bonds and 2 hydrophobic residues. These cysteines and hydrophobic residues are conserved in other VSGs, and we have modeled the structures of two further VSG C-terminal domains using the structure of MITat1.2. The models suggest that the overall structure of the core is conserved in the different VSGs but that the C-terminal alpha-helix is of variable length and depends on the presence of charged residues.

OBJECTIVE To explain the stronger effect of type 2 diabetes on the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in women compared with men. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The study population consisted of 1,296 nondiabetic subjects and 835 type 2 diabetic subjects aged 45-64 years without cardiovascular disease. The end points were CHD death and a major CHD event (CHD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction). The follow-up time was 13 years. RESULTS Major CHD event rate per 1,000 person-years was 11.6 in nondiabetic men, 1.8 in nondiabetic women, 36.3 in diabetic men, and 31.6 in diabetic women. The diabetes-related hazard ratio for a major CHD event from the Cox model, adjusted for age and area of residence, was 2.9 (95% CI 2.2-3.9) in men and 14.4 (8.4-24.5) in women, and after further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, 2.8 (2.0-3.7) and 9.5 (5.5-16.9), respectively. The burden of conventional risk factors in the presence of diabetes was greater in women than in men at baseline. Prospectively, elevated blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol, and high triglycerides contributed to diabetes-related CHD risk more in women than in men. However, after adjusting for conventional risk factors, a substantial proportion of diabetes-related CHD risk remained unexplained in both genders. CONCLUSIONS The stronger effect of type 2 diabetes on the risk of CHD in women compared with men was in part explained by a heavier risk factor burden and a greater effect of blood pressure and atherogenic dyslipidemia in diabetic women.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1044,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0027044294,0

15571721,"Characterization of segments from the central region of BRCA1: an intrinsically disordered scaffold for multiple protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions?. The BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene encodes an 1863 amino acid gene product that is implicated in many cellular pathways including transcription, cell-cycle checkpoint control, apoptosis and DNA repair. Much attention has been focused on the structural and biochemical characterization of the N-terminal RING and tandem C-terminal BRCT domains of BRCA1. Here we used NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with CD spectroscopy and limited proteolysis to investigate the biophysical properties of the approximately 1500 residue central region of BRCA1. Our results show that although there are a few small, mildly protease-resistant regions, the majority of the BRCA1 central region lacks any pre-existing independently folded globular domains. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence experiments also demonstrate that, although intrinsically disordered, polypeptides from the central region are able to mediate interactions with DNA and p53 with affinities in the low micromolar range. This supports a model in which the central region may act as a long flexible scaffold for intermolecular interactions, thereby helping to integrate multiple signals in the DNA damage response pathway.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1047,pos_MEDLINE,0.997813,1

We determined the x-ray structure of the RNA polymerase (Pol) II subcomplex Rpb4/7 at 2.3 A resolution, combined it with a previous structure of the 10-subunit polymerase core, and refined an atomic model of the complete 12-subunit Pol II at 3.8-A resolution. Comparison of the complete Pol II structure with structures of the Pol II core and free Rpb4/7 shows that the core-Rpb4/7 interaction goes along with formation of an alpha-helix in the linker region of the largest Pol II subunit and with folding of the conserved Rpb7 tip loop. Details of the core-Rpb4/7 interface explain facilitated Rpb4/7 dissociation in a temperature-sensitive Pol II mutant and specific assembly of Pol I with its Rpb4/7 counterpart, A43/14.

Estrogen receptor (ER) alpha is mutated (lysine 303 to arginine, K303R) in approximately one third of premalignant breast hyperplasias, which renders breast cancer cells expressing the mutant receptor hypersensitive for proliferation in response to low doses of estrogen. It is known that ERalpha is posttranslationally modified by protein acetylation and phosphorylation by a number of secondary messenger signaling cascades. The K303R ERalpha mutation resides at a major protein acetylation site adjacent to a potential protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site at residue 305 within the hinge domain of the receptor. Mutation of this phosphorylation site to aspartic acid to mimic constitutive phosphorylation blocks acetylation of the K303 ERalpha site and generates an enhanced transcriptional response similar to that seen with the naturally occurring K303R mutant receptor. Activation of PKA signaling by the cell-permeable cyclic AMP (cAMP) analog 8-bromo-cAMP further enhances estrogen sensitivity of the mutant receptor, whereas a specific PKA inhibitor antagonizes this increase. We propose that the hypersensitive ERalpha mutant breast cancer phenotype involves an integration of coupled acetylation and phosphorylation events by upstream signaling molecules.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1055,pos_MEDLINE,0.9175246,1

Determining the positions, shapes and sizes of finite living particles such as bacteria, mitochondria or vesicles is of interest in many biological processes. In fluorescence microscopy, algorithms that can simultaneously localize such particles as a function of time and determine the parameters of their shapes and sizes at the nanometer scale are not yet available. Here we develop two such algorithms based on convolution and correlation image analysis that take into account the position, orientation, shape and size of the object being tracked, and we compare the precision of the two algorithms using computer simulations. We show that the precision of both algorithms strongly depends on the object's size. In cases where the diameter of the object is larger than about four to five times the beam waist radius, the convolution algorithm gives a better precision than the correlation algorithm (it leads to more precise parameters), while for smaller object diameters, the correlation algorithm gives superior precision. We apply the convolution algorithm to sequences of confocal laser scanning micrographs of immobile Escherichia coli bacteria, and show that the centroid, the front end, the rear end, the left border and the right border of a bacterium can be determined with a signal-to-noise-dependent precision down to approximately 5 nm.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1056,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0028393746,0

Vertebrate collagenases, members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, initiate interstitial fibrillar collagen breakdown. It is essential in many biological processes, and unbalanced collagenolysis is associated with diseases such as arthritis, cancer, atherosclerosis, aneurysm, and fibrosis. These metalloproteinases are secreted from the cell as inactive precursors, procollagenases (proMMPs). To gain insights into the structural basis of their activation mechanisms and collagen binding, we have crystallized recombinant human proMMP-1 and determined its structure to 2.2 A resolution. The catalytic metalloproteinase domain and the C-terminal hemopexin (Hpx) domain show the classical MMP-fold, but the structure has revealed new features in surface loops and domain interaction. The prodomain is formed by a three-helix bundle and gives insight into the stepwise activation mechanism of proMMP-1. The prodomain interacts with the Hpx domain, which affects the position of the Hpx domain relative to the catalytic domain. This interaction results in a ""closed"" configuration of proMMP-1 in contrast to the ""open"" configuration observed previously for the structure of active MMP-1. This is the first evidence of mobility of the Hpx domain in relation to the catalytic domain, providing an important clue toward the understanding of the collagenase-collagen interaction and subsequent collagenolysis.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1057,pos_MEDLINE,0.9976126,1

Beta-Catenin plays an essential role in the Wingless/Wnt signaling cascade. Phosphorylation of beta-Catenin in its N-terminal region by the kinase GSK-3beta is required for the interaction with the SCF-beta-TrCP protein complex that targets beta-Catenin for proteasome degradation. In the present work, we used two peptides of 32 amino acids referred to beta-Cat17-48 and P-beta-Cat17-48 for the phosphorylated peptide at the two sites Ser33 and Ser37. Circular dichroism and NMR techniques were used to assess the influence of the phosphorylation. The spectra of the peptides at pH 7.2 were completely assigned. Analysis of the medium-range NOE connectivities indicated that beta-Cat17-48 seems to be only poorly folded. These data are in agreement with the result of structure calculations. P-beta-Cat17-48 possesses two helical segments around the DpSGXXpS motif, which forms a large bent with the phosphate groups pointing out of the structure. On the contrary, beta-Cat17-48 shows less well-defined secondary structures and appears as a more flexible peptide, but adopts in the motif DSGXXS a more compact conformation than P-beta-Cat17-48.

The proto-oncogene c-myc governs the expression of a number of genes targeting cell growth and apoptosis, and its expression levels are distorted in many cancer forms. The current investigation presents an analysis by proteolysis, circular dichroism, fluorescence and Biacore of the folding and ligand-binding properties of the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) in the c-Myc protein. A c-Myc sub-region comprising residues 1-167 (Myc1-167) has been investigated that includes the unstructured c-Myc transactivation domain (TAD, residues 1-143) together with a C-terminal segment, which appears to promote increased folding. Myc1-167 is partly helical, binds both to the target proteins Myc modulator-1 (MM-1) and TATA box-binding protein (TBP), and displays the characteristics of a molten globule. Limited proteolysis divides Myc1-167 in two halves, by cleaving in a predicted linker region between two hotspot mutation regions: Myc box I (MBI) and Myc box II (MBII). The N-terminal half (Myc1-88) is unfolded and does not alone bind to target proteins, whereas the C-terminal half (Myc92-167) has a partly helical fold and specifically binds both MM-1 and TBP. Although this might suggest a bipartite organization in the c-Myc TAD, none of the N and C-terminal fragments bind target protein with as high affinity as the entire Myc1-167, or display molten globule properties. Furthermore, merely linking the MBI with the C-terminal region, in Myc38-167, is not sufficient to achieve binding and folding properties as in Myc1-167. Thus, the entire N and C-terminal regions of c-Myc TAD act in concert to achieve high specificity and affinity to two structurally and functionally orthogonal target proteins, TBP and MM-1, possibly through a mechanism involving molten globule formation. This hints towards understanding how binding of a range of targets can be accomplished to a single transactivation domain.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1074,pos_MEDLINE,0.9970073,1

OBJECTIVES A novel evaluative approach was used to determine single unit activities of non-bursting intralaminar thalamic nuclei under neuropathic pain state following dorsal rhizotomy. SETTINGS AND DESIGN Extensive dorsal rhizotomy at cervicothoracic level in rats was used as a model of central pain. After rhizotomy, rats were divided into two groups: rats without any signs of self-mutilation, and those presenting self-mutilation. Spontaneous single unit activities of neurons of intralaminar thalamic nuclei were recorded and interspike intervals (ISIs) of non-bursting cells were counted for both groups and compared with that of non-rhizotomized control rats. Chaodynamic methods were applied for the evaluation of the ISIs. RESULTS In control rats Lyapunov exponents, Shannon entropy and mutual information average values were significantly higher than those of rhizotomized rats without any signs of self-mutilation. Paradoxically, in animals presenting self-mutilation following rhizotomy the evaluated parameters were similar to those of controls. Further, Lyapunov exponents were positive values in all animals indicating chaotic pattern of the neuronal firing. MAIN FINDINGS 1. Neurons behave in chaotic way in all animals, 2. The most regular firing was found in non-mutilating rhizotomized animals, 3. Patterns of the firing in selfmutilating rats were similar to those in controls.

The 2.0-angstrom structure of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) catalytic subunit bound to a deletion mutant of a regulatory subunit (RIalpha) defines a previously unidentified extended interface. The complex provides a molecular mechanism for inhibition of PKA and suggests how cAMP binding leads to activation.

We report the structures of DcpS in ligand-free form and in a complex with m7GDP. apo-DcpS is a symmetric dimer, strikingly different from the asymmetric dimer observed in the structures of DcpS with bound cap analogues. In contrast, and similar to the m7GpppG-DcpS complex, DcpS with bound m7GDP is an asymmetric dimer in which the closed state appears to be the substrate-bound complex, whereas the open state mimics the product-bound complex. Comparisons of these structures revealed conformational changes of both the N-terminal swapped-dimeric domain and the cap-binding pocket upon cap binding. Moreover, Tyr273 in the cap-binding pocket displays remarkable conformational changes upon cap binding. Mutagenesis and biochemical analysis suggest that Tyr273 seems to play an important role in cap binding and product release.

15941357,"Engineering a dimeric caspase-9: a re-evaluation of the induced proximity model for caspase activation. INTRODUCTION. Apoptosis plays a central role in animal development and tissue homeostasis. The essential machinery responsible for the execution of apoptosis is the caspases, a family of closely related cysteine proteases [1–6]. Caspases comprise two classes: the initiator caspases, such as caspase-8 and -9, and the effector caspases, such as caspases-3 and -7. Due to their deleterious roles, all caspases are synthesized as relatively inactive zymogens in the cell and, in response to apoptotic stimuli, undergo proteolytic activation. The activation of effector caspases is performed by the initiator caspases. The autoactivation of the initiator caspases is facilitated by other auxiliary factors. For example, the autoactivation of caspase-9 is mediated by the assembly of a heptameric complex involving Apaf-1 and cytochrome c, dubbed the apoptosome [7–9]. Once activated, caspase-9 cleaves and activates caspases-3 and -7. The molecular mechanism for the activation of the effector caspases has been elucidated [6]. The caspase zymogen, such as procaspase-7, exists as a homodimer in solution but exhibits poor catalytic activity because its active sites exist in an unproductive conformation. The activation cleavage of procaspase-7 allows the relocation of a surface loop from one monomer to critically support the active site of the adjacent monomer, hence allowing catalysis to proceed [10,11]. In contrast, the mechanism for the activation of the initiator caspases, which generally involves the formation of an oligomeric complex [9], has remained elusive [12]. The prevailing hypothesis has been the “induced proximity” model, which summarized a set of elegant experiments [13–17] to state that caspase zymogens are autoprocessed once they are brought into proximity with each other [18]. However, this initial explanation of the induced proximity model contained little mechanistic information until it was enhanced by the proposition that the oligomeric complex (such as the apoptosome) serves to activate the monomeric initiator caspases through induced dimerization via their intrinsic dimerization interface [19–21]. Supporting this hypothesis, caspase-9 exists predominantly as a monomer in solution and exhibits a basal level of catalytic activity [19,22]. Induced proximity, interpreted as dimerization-driven activation of caspases, is perceived as a dominant model of initiator caspase activation [19–21,23]. Despite its popularity, the notion of dimerization-driven activation of initiator caspases is at odds with some well-known facts. For example, if the activation of the initiator caspases requires merely dimerization, why would the apoptosome exhibit a 7-fold symmetry? Along this line, the activation of caspase-8 requires the assembly of a multi-component death-inducing signaling complex, which has a 3-fold symmetry. The induced proximity model states that the dimerization of caspase-9, via its intrinsic dimerization interface, is the central and only step in its activation, and the assembly of the apoptosome serves merely to facilitate the dimerization of caspase-9 [19,20,23]. Thus, caspase-9 in its dimeric form is expected to exhibit the same catalytic activity as caspase-9 when it is activated by the apoptosome. An essential experiment in assessing the correctness of this prediction is to directly compare the catalytic activity of the dimeric caspase-9 with that of the apoptosome-activated caspase-9. Unfortunately, the wild-type (WT) caspase-9 dimer defies isolation, because it does not represent a stable state in solution [22]. The only approach is to engineer a constitutive caspase-9 homodimer that will dimerize via its intrinsic dimerization interface. In this report, we revisit the induced proximity model through the engineering of a constitutively dimeric caspase-9. We demonstrate that, despite the fact that this dimer variant exhibits a higher level of catalytic activity in vitro and induces more efficient cell death than the WT caspase-9, it is qualitatively different from the Apaf-1-activated caspase-9. Importantly, the structure of the engineered caspase-9 closely resembles that of the WT caspase-9, including all relevant structural details and the asymmetric nature of the two monomers. Our data, in conjunction with other evidence, suggest a refined model of the induced proximity hypothesis. At the center of this model is an induced conformation of the active site, hence the name induced conformation model. RESULTS. RATIONALE FOR THE DESIGN OF A DIMERIC CASPASE-9. While all members of the caspase family share a similar overall structure, small differences in their primary sequences lead to their individuality [1,4]. An effector caspase, such as caspase-3, exists exclusively as a stable homodimer in solution. In contrast, biochemical and structural analyses revealed that dimerization of the initiator caspase-9, although possible, was energetically unfavorable [1,19,22]. To facilitate the design of a constitutively dimeric caspase-9, we examined the dimerization interface of several representative caspases. In caspase-3, the dimerization interface is mediated primarily by two β-strands (β6 and β6′), one from each monomer (Figure 1A). Together, 63% of the buried surface area at the dimeric interface is contributed by these two centrally located β-strands and their immediate flanking residues. Consistent with a critical role in dimerization, residues on these two β-strands exhibit relatively low temperature factors. Importantly, sequence alignment among four representative caspases revealed an extremely varied section of five consecutive amino acids on strand β6, flanked on either side by stretches of conserved residues (Figure 1B). For example, the five residues Cys264-Ile-Val-Ser-Met268 in caspase-3 are replaced by Gly402-Cys-Phe-Asn-Phe406 in caspase-9, while five of the eight flanking residues are invariant between these two caspases.

Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction signify two important biochemical events associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies using in vitro and in vivo PD models and in affected tissues from the disease itself have demonstrated a selective inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity that appears to affect normal mitochondrial physiology leading to neuronal cell death. Earlier experiments from our laboratory have demonstrated that induced depletion of glutathione (GSH + GSSG) in cultured dopaminergic cells resulted in increased oxidative stress and a decrease in mitochondrial function. Furthermore, this dysfunction was linked to a selective decrease in mitochondrial complex I activity that appears to be due to oxidation of this complex. Glutathione depletion is the earliest detectable biochemical event during PD progression and occurs prior to complex I inhibition. Recent observations have also indicated that oxidative damage to complex I via naturally occurring free radicals such as peroxynitrite leads to modification of tyrosine and/or cysteine residues resulting in complex I inhibition. Using the sucrose gradient method, we detected in complex I-enriched fractions from a glutathione-depleted dopaminergic cell line two bands corresponding to approximately 25-kDa and approximately 30-kDa polypeptides that demonstrate anti-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity, suggesting the possible involvement of protein nitration by peroxynitrite in glutathione depletion-mediated complex I inhibition.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1163,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.013636835,0

Numerous experimental vaccines have been developed with the goal of generating long-term cell-mediated immunity to the obligate intracellular parasite Leishmania major, yet inoculation with live, wild-type L. major remains the only successful vaccine in humans. We examined the expression of immunity at the site of secondary, low-dose challenge in the ear dermis to determine the kinetics of parasite clearance and the early events associated with the protection conferred by vaccination with live L. major organisms in C57BL/6 mice. Particular attention was given to the route of vaccination. We observed that the rapidity, strength, and durability of the memory response following subcutaneous vaccination with live parasites in the footpad are even greater than previously appreciated. Antigen-specific gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-producing T cells infiltrate the secondary site by 1.5 weeks, and viable parasites are cleared as early as 2.5 weeks following rechallenge, followed by a rapid drop in IFN-gamma(+) CD4(+) cell numbers in the site. In comparison, intradermal vaccination with live parasites in the ear generates immunity that is delayed in effector cell recruitment to the rechallenge site and in the clearance of parasites from the site. This compromised immunity was associated with a rapid recruitment of interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing CD4(+) T cells to the rechallenge site. Treatment with anti-IL-10-receptor or anti-CD25 antibody enhanced early parasite clearance in ear-vaccinated mice, indicating that chronic infection in the skin generates a population of regulatory cells capable of influencing the level of resistance to reinfection.

At the cellular level, JN in the rat CNS colocalized with 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), a cytoskeleton-related oligodendroglial protein.

To this end, the effects of food extracts and individual compounds on the in vitro activity of xanthine oxidase (XO) were assessed, many for the first time. Several compounds were shown to be potent inhibitors in vitro, including hesperetin and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate with IC50 values of 39 and 49 microM, respectively. Of the extracts, cranberry juice, purple grape juice, and black tea were the most potent, with IC50 values of 2.4, 3.5, and 5.8% of extracts, respectively. Some samples were shown to promote XO activity over the concentration ranges tested, including orange juice and pink grapefruit juice. Certain ""inhibitors"", such as purple grape juice and black tea, promoted XO activity at low concentration. The possible role of dietary inhibitors of XO in reducing oxidative stress in vivo is discussed.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1176,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.003254005,0
16086945,"Involution of retinopathy of prematurity after laser treatment: factors associated with development of retinal detachment. PURPOSE To identify specific features during the process of involution of retinopathy of prematurity after treatment at threshold that are associated with development of a retinal detachment. DESIGN Retrospective case series. METHODS The evolution of retinal detachments over time was analyzed retrospectively in 262 treated eyes of 138 infants. Specific features hypothesized to be associated with development of a retinal detachment were analyzed, including vitreous organization defined as clinically important, active stage 3 disease and active plus disease more than 21 days after treatment, and vitreous hemorrhage defined as clinically important. RESULTS A retinal detachment developed in 36 (13.7%) of 262 eyes. Vitreous organization meeting our clinically important definition was associated with a 31-fold (confidence interval [CI] 5.37-183.63; P < .0001) and 13-fold (CI 2.97-58.59; P < .0001) increase in the odds for retinal detachment for right and left eyes, respectively. Vitreous hemorrhage defined as clinically important was associated with a 38-fold (CI 2.69-551.19; P = .007) and 15-fold (CI 1.65-144.12; P = .02) increase in the odds for retinal detachment for right and left eyes, respectively. The timing of retinal detachment relative to vitreous hemorrhage was not determined. Prolonged activity of Stage 3 disease or plus disease more than 21 days after treatment was not associated with development of a retinal detachment. CONCLUSIONS Clinically important vitreous organization and vitreous hemorrhage were predictive for development of a retinal detachment. Evaluation of preemptive reintervention strategies for eyes at highest risk for developing a retinal detachment may be reasonable.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1180,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0029349516,0
16115872,"GTP cyclohydrolase II structure and mechanism. GTP cyclohydrolase II converts GTP to 2,5-diamino-6-beta-ribosyl-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate, formate and pyrophosphate, the first step in riboflavin biosynthesis. The essential role of riboflavin in metabolism and the absence of GTP cyclohydrolase II in higher eukaryotes makes it a potential novel selective antimicrobial drug target. GTP cyclohydrolase II catalyzes a distinctive overall reaction from GTP cyclohydrolase I; the latter converts GTP to dihydroneopterin triphosphate, utilized in folate and tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis. The structure of GTP cyclohydrolase II determined at 1.54-A resolution reveals both a different protein fold to GTP cyclohydrolase I and distinctive molecular recognition determinants for GTP; although in both enzymes there is a bound catalytic zinc. The GTP cyclohydrolase II.GMPCPP complex structure shows Arg(128) interacting with the alpha-phosphonate, and thus in the case of GTP, Arg(128) is positioned to act as the nucleophile for pyrophosphate release and formation of the proposed covalent guanylyl-GTP cyclohydrolase II intermediate. Tyr(105) is identified as playing a key role in GTP ring opening; it is hydrogen-bonded to the zinc-activated water molecule, the latter being positioned for nucleophilic attack on the guanine C-8 atom. Although GTP cyclohydrolase I and GTP cyclohydrolase II both use a zinc ion for the GTP ring opening and formate release, different residues are utilized in each case to catalyze this reaction step.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1188,pos_MEDLINE,0.99743915,1

METHODS From March 1995 to June 2002, tendons rupture and tendons defect were repaired by ultra-deep-low-temperature allogeneic tendon grafts in 96 cases, including 51 cases of flexor or extensor tendon defect of hand, 36 cases of coracoclavicular ligament rupture, 4 cases of cruciate ligament rupture, 2 cases of calcaneus tendon rupture and 3 cases of extensor tendon defect of foot. The interval between injury and operation was 1 day to 5 months. The length of defect was 4-12 cm with an average of 7 cm. The matching allogeneic tendons were selected during operation, and early function exercise was done after operation. Secondary release was performed in the cases of tendon adhesion. RESULTS Follow-up time is from 6 months to 5 years (3.4 years on average). No rejection or rupture occurred after tendon allograft. The satisfactory result was achieved in 92.71% of the cases.

We report the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human ADAR2, an RNA editing enzyme, at 1.7 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals a zinc ion in the active site and suggests how the substrate adenosine is recognized. Unexpectedly, inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) is buried within the enzyme core, contributing to the protein fold. Although there are no reports that adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) require a cofactor, we show that IP6 is required for activity. Amino acids that coordinate IP6 in the crystal structure are conserved in some adenosine deaminases that act on transfer RNA (tRNA) (ADATs), related enzymes that edit tRNA. Indeed, IP6 is also essential for in vivo and in vitro deamination of adenosine 37 of tRNAala by ADAT1.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1197,pos_MEDLINE,0.997813,1

1617468,"Children's strategies for coping with adverse home environments: an interpretation using attachment theory. The coping strategies of four groups of maltreated children were compared with those of adequately reared children. The children were videotaped in a brief play session with their mothers, then in the Strange Situation, and finally during free play while the parent(s) were being interviewed. The coded videotapes of mother-child interaction yielded four scores for the children: cooperation, compulsive compliance, difficultness, and passivity. The coded videotapes of the Strange Situation yielded ten patterns of child attachment to the mother. The coded observations of play during the interview were analyzed in terms of seven child behaviors. The results indicated that abused, and abused-and-neglected children were difficult or compliant in interaction with their mothers, avoidant under stress, and aggressive with siblings; neglected children were cooperative in play with the mother, anxious under stress, and aggressive with siblings; adequately reared children were cooperative with both their mothers and siblings and secure under stress. Older children who had experienced abuse were less difficult and more compulsively compliant. Both marginally maltreated and adequately reared 1-year-olds were more difficult than either older or younger children from those groups but at all ages cooperation was the dominant pattern.

16211010,"Structure and mechanisms of the proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme USP14. The ubiquitin-specific processing protease (UBP) family of deubiquitinating enzymes plays an essential role in numerous cellular processes. Mammalian USP14 (Ubp6 in yeast) is unique among known UBP enzymes in that it is activated catalytically upon specific association with the 26S proteasome. Here, we report the crystal structures of the 45-kDa catalytic domain of USP14 in isolation and in a complex with ubiquitin aldehyde, which reveal distinct structural features. In the absence of ubiquitin binding, the catalytic cleft leading to the active site of USP14 is blocked by two surface loops. Binding by ubiquitin induces a significant conformational change that translocates the two surface loops thereby allowing access of the ubiquitin C-terminus to the active site. These structural observations, in conjunction with biochemical characterization, identify important regulatory mechanisms for USP14.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1215,pos_MEDLINE,0.99789655,1

One of many protein-protein interactions modulated upon DNA damage is that of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), with the p53 tumor suppressor. Here we report the crystal structure of RPA residues 1-120 (RPA70N) bound to the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 (residues 37-57; p53N) and, by using NMR spectroscopy, characterize two mechanisms by which the RPA/p53 interaction can be modulated. RPA70N forms an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold, similar to that previously observed for the ssDNA-binding domains of RPA. In contrast, the N-terminal p53 transactivation domain is largely disordered in solution, but residues 37-57 fold into two amphipathic helices, H1 and H2, upon binding with RPA70N. The H2 helix of p53 structurally mimics the binding of ssDNA to the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold. NMR experiments confirmed that both ssDNA and an acidic peptide mimicking a phosphorylated form of RPA32N can independently compete the acidic p53N out of the binding site.

Selenium has significant health benefits, including potent cancer prevention activity and roles in immune function and the male reproductive system. Selenium-containing proteins, which incorporate this essential micronutrient as selenocysteine, are proposed to mediate the positive effects of dietary selenium. Presented here are the solution NMR structures of the selenoprotein SelM and an ortholog of the selenoprotein Sep15. These data reveal that Sep15 and SelM are structural homologs that establish a new thioredoxin-like protein family. The location of the active-site redox motifs within the fold together with the observed localized conformational changes after thiol-disulfide exchange and measured redox potential indicate that they have redox activity. In mammals, Sep15 expression is regulated by dietary selenium, and either decreased or increased expression of this selenoprotein alters redox homeostasis. A physiological role for Sep15 and SelM as thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases and their contribution to the quality control pathways of the endoplasmic reticulum are discussed.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1244,pos_MEDLINE,0.99796116,1

Removal of the cap structure is catalyzed by the Dcp1-Dcp2 complex. The crystal structure of a C-terminally truncated Schizosaccharomyces pombe Dcp2p reveals two distinct domains: an all-helical N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain that is a classic Nudix fold. The C-terminal domain of both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. pombe Dcp2p proteins is sufficient for decapping activity, although the N-terminal domain can affect the efficiency of Dcp2p function. The binding of Dcp2p to Dcp1p is mediated by a conserved surface on its N-terminal domain, and the N-terminal domain is required for Dcp1p to stimulate Dcp2p activity. The flexible nature of the N-terminal domain relative to the C-terminal domain suggests that Dcp1p binding to Dcp2p may regulate Dcp2p activity through conformational changes of the two domains.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1253,pos_MEDLINE,0.99760324,1

Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) phosphoprotein (P), an essential cofactor of the viral polymerase, is much shorter (241 aa) than and has no sequence similarity to P of other paramyxoviruses. Nevertheless, bioinformatic analysis of HRSV P sequence revealed a modular organization, reminiscent of other paramyxovirus Ps, with a central structured domain (aa 100-200), flanked by two intrinsically disordered regions (1-99 and 201-241). To test the predicted structure experimentally, HRSV P was purified from cell extracts infected with recombinant vaccinia virus or HRSV. The estimated molecular mass of P by gel filtration (approximately 500 kDa) greatly exceeded the theoretical mass of a homotetramer, proposed as the oligomeric form of native P. Nevertheless, the profile of cross-linked products obtained with purified P resembled that reported by others with P purified from bacteria or mammalian cells. Thus, the shape of HRSV P probably influences its elution from the gel filtration column, as reported for other paramyxovirus Ps. Digestion of purified HRSV P with different proteases identified a trypsin-resistant fragment (X) that reacted with a previously characterized monoclonal antibody (021/2P). N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis placed the X fragment boundaries (Glu-104 and Arg-163) within the predicted structured domain of P. Cross-linking and circular dichroism analyses indicated that fragment X was oligomeric, with a high alpha-helical content, properties resembling those of the multimerization domain of Sendai and rinderpest virus P. These results denote structural features shared by HRSV and other paramyxovirus Ps and should assist in elucidation of the HRSV P structure.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1261,pos_MEDLINE,0.99746394,1
16364032,"Neurogenic components of trypsin- and thrombin-induced inflammation in rat skin, in vivo. Activation of protease-activated receptors (PAR) can induce vasodilation (VD) and increase of vascular permeability either directly by stimulating endothelial cells or indirectly via activation of nociceptors and subsequent release of neuropeptides (neurogenic inflammation). We aimed to estimate the relative contribution of the two pathways for stimulation with endogenous activators of PAR-2 (trypsin) and of PAR-1, 3 and 4 (thrombin) using in vivo dermal microdialysis in rats. Protein extravasation (PE) was assessed by increase of protein concentration in the dialysate, and VD was quantified by laser Doppler scanning. Both trypsin (10(-8)-10(-4) M) and thrombin (10(-6), 10(-5.5) and 10(-5) M) provoked PE and local VD in a dose-dependent manner. Trypsin (10(-4) M)-induced PE was inhibited by 87.2 +/- 21% due to the substance P (SP) NK1 receptor antagonist SR140333. VD was blocked by 58.15 +/- 10.1% in response to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist CGRP(8-37). By contrast, CGRP(8-37) did not affect thrombin-induced VD, while blockade of SP receptors prevented the PE elicited only by low doses of thrombin (10(-6) M), being ineffective at higher thrombin concentrations. In conclusion, intradermal trypsin elicits a neurogenic inflammation in rat, probably mediated via PAR-2 activation on nociceptors and subsequent SP and CGRP release. Thrombin-induced PE and VD are mediated mainly by a non-neurogenic mechanism.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1263,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0039685,0

GNA1870, a 28-kDa surface-exposed lipoprotein of Neisseria meningitidis recently discovered by reverse vaccinology, is one of the most potent antigens of Meningococcus and a promising candidate for a universal vaccine against a devastating disease. Previous studies of epitope mapping and genetic characterization identified residues critical for bactericidal response within the C-terminal domain of the molecule. To elucidate the conformation of protective epitopes, we used NMR spectroscopy to obtain the solution structure of the immunodominant 18-kDa C-terminal portion of GNA1870. The structure consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel overlaid by a short alpha-helix with an unstructured N-terminal end. Residues previously shown to be important for antibody recognition were mapped on loops facing the same ridge of the molecule.

16485489,"Hemolytic uremic syndrome risk and Escherichia coli O157:H7. In the United States, Escherichia coli O157:H7 causes ≈73,000 infections and 60 deaths annually (1). Infection progresses to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in 2% to 15% of cases (2). In studies of E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks, female sex, young age, elevated leukocyte count, antimicrobial drug use, vomiting, and fever have been reported as risk factors for HUS (3–11). Previously, a possible association between HUS and female sex, young age, and prolonged duration of diarrhea was shown in a study that evaluated the New York state surveillance system for postdiarrheal HUS (12). This report extends that study to investigate hospitalized patients with E. coli O157:H7 infection to assess potential risk factors for progression of infection to HUS by using a case-control study. THE STUDY. Medical charts of all persons who were hospitalized and reported with confirmed cases of E. coli O157:H7 to the New York State Department of Health's Communicable Disease Surveillance System (CDSS) in 1998 and 1999 were reviewed according to a standardized survey form. A HUS case was defined as occurring in a patient with acute diarrhea who was hospitalized with E. coli O157:H7 infection and in whom confirmed or probable postdiarrheal HUS developed. A confirmed HUS case was defined as occurring in a patient with a clear history of acute diarrhea who showed the following signs: hemolytic anemia with microangiopathic changes, renal insufficiency (creatinine level >1.0 mg/dL in a child <13 years of age or >1.5 mg/dL in an adult, or >50% increase over baseline), and thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150,000/μL). A probable HUS case was defined as occurring in a patient with acute diarrhea with all the above signs except microangiopathic changes in the blood smear. Controls were hospitalized patients with E. coli O157:H7 infection without HUS. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were abstracted from medical charts. Statistical analysis was performed by using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with development of HUS. In 1998 and 1999, the CDSS received reports of 1,170 cases of E. coli O157: H7 infection. Of these, 255 patients (21%) were hospitalized and 238 (93%) had medical charts available for review. Thirty-six (15%) patients were confirmed (n = 29) or probable (n = 7) HUS case-patients, and 202 E. coli O157:H7–infected patients without HUS were identified as controls. The risk of HUS was highest among children <5 years of age, compared with patients >65 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2–11.8). Sixty-nine percent of HUS patients were female compared with 61% of controls (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.8–3.4). The hospital stay was significantly longer for HUS patients than controls (median hospital stay 13 vs. 3 days). Five HUS patients (14%) died, including 2 children <5 years of age, compared with 2 controls (1%). Forty percent of all patients had vomiting, and 85% had bloody stool. These factors were not significantly different between patients and controls. Eleven (31%) case-patients and 78 (38%) controls were treated with antimicrobial drugs (not significant). Antimicrobial treatment was reported in 11 patients before the diagnosis of HUS: 6 received antimicrobial drugs primarily for other conditions (e.g., urinary tract infection, otitis media, venous line sepsis), 1 had treatment stopped once E. coli O157:H7 was diagnosed, and we could not tell whether drug regimens were completed or discontinued in 4 patients. HUS patients were more likely than non-HUS controls to have fever (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6–6.5). The duration of diarrhea before hospitalization was significantly longer for HUS patients than for non-HUS controls (median 4 vs. 2 days). Proteinuria and hematuria were observed significantly more often among the case-patients. Twenty-three (64%) patients had proteinuria at admission, whereas 37 (18%) controls were admitted with proteinuria (OR 7.8, 95% CI 3.6–17). Hematuria at admission was reported in 23 (64%) patients and 57 (28%) controls (OR 4.5, 95% CI 2.1–9.4). Twenty-nine (81%) HUS patients vs. 90 (44%) controls had leukocyte counts >13,000/μL (OR 5.2, 95% CI 2.2–12.3) at admission (Table 1). Factors associated with HUS in univariate analysis (age <5 years, outbreak case, fever, hematuria, proteinuria, leukocytosis at admission, and duration of diarrhea before hospitalization >3 days) were included in the multivariate analysis. The following variables were associated with HUS development in the multivariate analysis: proteinuria (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.9–24.1), duration of diarrhea before hospitalization >3 days (OR 6.2, 95% CI 2.2–17.4), age <5 years (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.9–17.6), and leukocyte count >13,000/μL (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.6–12.6). Factors such as outbreak involvement, hematuria and fever were not associated with HUS development (Table 2). CONCLUSIONS. This study provides additional information on potential risk factors for progression of E. coli O157:H7 infection to HUS, but unlike other studies, this study used hospitalized rather than outpatient controls. Our data confirmed previous differences in risk for HUS development by age group (3–5). Women and girls have been reported to be at increased risk for HUS development in several studies (10,11), but our study showed no significant increased risk. Several studies have suggested that administration of antimicrobial agents increases risk for HUS development (5,6,9,13), but no significant relationship was observed between HUS and the use of antimicrobial drugs in our sample. Although reports (5,7) have demonstrated a higher incidence of HUS among patients with bloody diarrhea, fever, or vomiting, our multivariate analysis did not show a significant association between these characteristics and HUS.

16495236,"Biochemical and NMR analyses of an SF3b155-p14-U2AF-RNA interaction network involved in branch point definition during pre-mRNA splicing. The p14 subunit of the essential splicing factor 3b (SF3b) can be cross-linked to the branch-point adenosine of pre-mRNA introns within the spliceosome. p14 stably interacts with the SF3b subunit SF3b155, which also binds the 65-kDa subunit of U2 auxiliary splicing factor (U2AF65). We combined biochemical and NMR techniques to study the conformation of p14 either alone or complexed with SF3b155 fragments, as well as an interaction network involving p14, SF3b155, U2AF65, and U2 snRNA/pre-mRNA. p14 comprises a canonical RNA recognition motif (RRM) with an additional C-terminal helix (alphaC) and a beta hairpin insertion. SF3b155 binds to the beta-sheet surface of p14, thereby occupying the canonical RNA-binding site of the p14 RRM. The minimal region of SF3b155 interacting with p14 (i.e., residues 381-424) consists of four alpha-helices, which are partially preformed in isolation. Helices alpha2 and alpha3 (residues 401-415) constitute the core p14-binding epitope. Regions of SF3b155 binding to p14 and U2AF65 are nonoverlapping. This allows for a simultaneous interaction of SF3b155 with both proteins, which may support the stable association of U2 snRNP with the pre-mRNA. p14-RNA interactions are modulated by SF3b155 and the RNA-binding site of the p14-SF3b155 complex involves the noncanonical beta hairpin insertion of the p14 RRM, consistent with the beta-sheet surface being occupied by the helical SF3b155 peptide and p14 helix alphaC. Our data suggest that p14 lacks inherent specificity for recognizing the branch point, but that some specificity may be achieved by scaffolding interactions involving other components of SF3b.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1297,pos_MEDLINE,0.99793327,1
16507569,"Recycling of MUC1 is dependent on its palmitoylation. MUC1 is a mucin-like transmembrane protein expressed on the apical surface of epithelia, where it protects the cell surface. The cytoplasmic domain has numerous sites for phosphorylation and docking of proteins involved in signal transduction. In a previous study, we showed that the cytoplasmic YXXphi motif Y20HPM and the tyrosine-phosphorylated Y60TNP motif are required for MUC1 clathrin-mediated endocytosis through binding AP-2 and Grb2, respectively (Kinlough, C.

Palmitoylation of transmembrane proteins can affect their membrane trafficking, and the MUC1 sequence CQC3RRK at the boundary of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains mimics reported site(s) of S-palmitoylation. [3H]Palmitate labeling of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing MUC1 with mutations in CQC3RRK revealed that MUC1 is dually palmitoylated at the CQC motif independent of RRK. Lack of palmitoylation did not affect the cold detergent solubility profile of a chimera (Tac ectodomain and MUC1 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains), the rate of chimera delivery to the cell surface, or its half-life. Calculation of rate constants for membrane trafficking of wild-type and mutant Tac-MUC1 indicated that the lack of palmitoylation blocked recycling, but not endocytosis, and caused the chimera to accumulate in a EGFP-Rab11-positive endosomal compartment.

The replication of flaviviruses requires the correct processing of their polyprotein by the viral NS3 protease (NS3pro). Essential for the activation of NS3pro is a 47-residue region of NS2B. Here we report the crystal structures of a dengue NS2B-NS3pro complex and a West Nile virus NS2B-NS3pro complex with a substrate-based inhibitor. These structures identify key residues for NS3pro substrate recognition and clarify the mechanism of NS3pro activation.,MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1313,pos_MEDLINE,0.9975986,1
16542639,"Biophysical characterisation reveals structural disorder in the nucleolar protein, Dribble. Dribble (DBE) is an essential protein in Drosophila that belongs to the evolutionarily conserved Krr1p protein family. Proteins in this family are localised in the cell nucleolus and are important for the processing of ribosomal RNAs. However, little is known about their structural and biophysical properties. We have expressed and purified full-length DBE protein from Escherichia coli. Consistent with the native role of DBE in RNA processing, recombinant DBE was shown to bind RNA homo-polymers in vitro. By bioinformatics, size-exclusion chromatography, equilibrium sedimentation analysis, controlled proteolysis, and a variety of spectroscopic techniques, we have found that DBE is a monomeric protein in solution containing both alpha- and beta-structures. Moreover, the structure of DBE is expanded and significantly disordered (approximately 45% disordered). Natively disordered proteins are thought to provide a disproportionately large surface area and structural plasticity for nucleic acid binding. We therefore propose that the presence of structural disorder is an important feature of DBE that facilitates the protein to interact with RNAs in the nucleolus.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1315,pos_MEDLINE,0.99796116,1

16565295,"Structural investigation of disordered stress proteins. Comparison of full-length dehydrins with isolated peptides of their conserved segments. Dehydrins constitute a class of intrinsically disordered proteins that are expressed under conditions of water-related stress. Characteristic of the dehydrins are some highly conserved stretches of seven to 17 residues that are repetitively scattered in their sequences, the K-, S-, Y-, and Lys-rich segments. In this study, we investigate the putative role of these segments in promoting structure. The analysis is based on comparative analysis of four full-length dehydrins from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; Cor47, Lti29, Lti30, and Rab18) and isolated peptide mimics of the K-, Y-, and Lys-rich segments. In physiological buffer, the circular dichroism spectra of the full-length dehydrins reveal overall disordered structures with a variable content of poly-Pro helices, a type of elongated secondary structure relying on bridging water molecules. Similar disordered structures are observed for the isolated peptides of the conserved segments. Interestingly, neither the full-length dehydrins nor their conserved segments are able to adopt specific structure in response to altered temperature, one of the factors that regulate their expression in vivo. There is also no structural response to the addition of metal ions, increased protein concentration, or the protein-stabilizing salt Na(2)SO(4). Taken together, these observations indicate that the dehydrins are not in equilibrium with high-energy folded structures. The result suggests that the dehydrins are highly evolved proteins, selected to maintain high configurational flexibility and to resist unspecific collapse and aggregation. The role of the conserved segments is thus not to promote tertiary structure, but to exert their biological function more locally upon interaction with specific biological targets, for example, by acting as beads on a string for specific recognition, interaction with membranes, or intermolecular scaffolding. In this perspective, it is notable that the Lys-rich segment in Cor47 and Lti29 shows sequence similarity with the animal chaperone HSP90.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1321,pos_MEDLINE,0.99791294,1
16569232,"Serious infections in children: an incidence study in family practice. BACKGROUND. The incidence of acute infections in children is high. Using data from the English fourth Practice-Based Morbidity Survey, children under 1 year of age reported an average of 3.3 infections in a year, and 1.2 infections in the age group 1–15 years [1]. Acute upper respiratory infection is the dominant diagnosis, which is essentially a harmless, self-limiting disease. However, some infections can have serious consequences. For example, bacterial meningitis leads to mortality in 5% of the cases and morbidity, such as hearing loss, in 10%–15%[2]. Up to 24% mortality after meningococcal disease, being sepsis or meningitis, has been reported[3]. In developing countries, pneumonia and diarrhoea are two of the leading causes of mortality in children under the age of 5[4]. In the period of 1989–1993, infectious diseases were responsible for 7.5% of all deaths in children under the age of 1, and for 9.3% of all deaths in children between 1 and 14 years old in the Northern region of the UK[5]. Serious infections are usually defined as serious bacterial infections: pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis, pyelonephritis, bacterial gastro-enteritis, osteomyelitis and cellulitis. [6-9]. However, pneumonia and meningitis are often caused by viruses and other viral infections can be serious as well, for example bronchiolitis. In general practice, bacterial aetiology is difficult to establish and the serious nature of the infection is sometimes determined by the need for interventions such as hospitalization or specific treatment. Therefore, in primary care pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis, bacterial gastro-enteritis, pyelonephritis, osteomyelitis and bronchiolitis can be considered serious infections. The diagnosis of a serious infection is difficult in general practice, as the majority of the infections presented to the general practitioner is not serious and the initial presentation of serious and non-serious infections can be similar. Still, early diagnosis of a serious infection is important to avoid delay in treatment and improve prognosis [10-12]. There is very limited information on the incidence of serious infections in general practice. Most studies were performed in hospital. They have found serious infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis and bacterial gastroenteritis to be present in up to 25% of febrile infants presenting to the emergency department[13,14]. These results can not be transferred to general practice, because of the large differences between the populations. Other studies in general practice have reported incidences for individual infections [15-17], but differences in health care structure limit the applicability to the Belgian context. Therefore, we conducted this study to calculate the age-specific incidence of serious infections in children, seen in general practice in Belgium. Additionally, we determined the proportion of serious infections in the entire group of children with an acute infection and we studied seasonal influence. METHODS. Intego is a morbidity registration network, coordinated by the department of general practice of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. 51 general practitioners in 43 practices continuously register all diagnoses and additional data in their electronic medical records. These practices have been selected by the quality of their registration. The information is automatically extracted from the records on a yearly basis and collected in a central database. Diagnoses are classified according to a very detailed diagnostic classification list and converted into ICPC-2 codes[18,19]. As there is free access to all physicians in Belgium, and patients are not forced to register to a practice, it is difficult to establish the practice population. This is particularly important as the incidence of a disease in a certain practice equals all new cases of this disease in that practice, in the nominator, divided by the practice population in the denominator. Until recently, only the group of patients that had consulted their GP at least once in that year has been used as denominator, called the Yearly Contact Group. But, as it was hypothesised that some factors have an influence on the consultation rate of a patient, for example age, gender or social status, it was not possible to extrapolate this Yearly Contact Group to the total practice population, because these influencing factors can be present in certain practices more than in others. Now, data of the Health Insurance Agency have been made available, by which it was possible to estimate a practice population, starting from the Yearly Contact Group and taking age, gender and region into account. This population will be referred to as the Practice Population. A more detailed description of this methodology has been published elsewhere[20]. For children, the difference between the Yearly Contact Group and the Practice Population is particularly large, because some children never consult a general practitioner but only a paediatrician. This makes the estimation of a practice population less appropriate for this age group, because the extrapolation to a larger group that never visits the general practitioner is not very useful. For this reason, the main outcome measures are presented for both the Yearly Contact Group and the Practice Population. Secondary outcome measures are presented for the Yearly Contact Group only. Incidences are calculated as the number of events per 1000 patient-years and based upon the data from 1998 to 2002. If a disease occurred more than once during the study period, each occurrence was calculated. The diagnoses that were analysed are presented in table 1, with their corresponding ICPC-2 code. Serious infections are marked with *. The ICPC-A78 code, other infection not otherwise specified, contains several diagnoses, including sepsis.

We have previously identified transcription factors binding to the proximal promoter region of the human COL1A2 gene that are essential for promoter activity. Two regions in the proximal promoter, the CCAAT-element and the CME bind the CCAAT-binding factor and an as yet uncharacterized DNA-binding protein, respectively. In this study we show that phosphorylation of both the CCAAT-binding and CME-binding proteins are essential for DNA-binding activity. While the binding of the CCAAT-binding proteins to the COL1A2 proximal promoter was inhibited after treatment of nuclear proteins with calf intestinal phosphatase, PP2A treatment had a significant inhibitory effect on the binding of the CME-binding proteins. The treatment of type I collagen producing fibroblasts, CT-1, with the kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, interfered with DNA-protein interactions on both elements on the COL1A2 proximal promoter. This inhibition was associated with a significant decrease in both endogenous COL1A2 gene expression as observed by northern blot analysis and proximal promoter activity as assayed in transient transfection assays. Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of transcription factors interacting with the COL1A2 proximal promoter is essential for both DNA binding and for the expression of this gene.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1335,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.87589324,1

The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between the measurement of transverse diameter of the proximal neck on computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and graduated catheter aortography in patients who are candidates for endovascular graft placement in order to replace, if both measurements are equivalent, aortography for CTA alone. Preoperative dual-slice CTA and graduated catheter aortography were performed in 35 consecutive patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysm within 10 days. Transverse proximal neck diameters were measured on a true axial section on CTA reconstructions and on aortographic images, always 6 mm distal from the most inferior main renal artery. Mean, median, and standard deviation were obtained and the measurements correlated for each patient using Pearson's correlation and linear regression analysis. A significant difference in proximal neck transverse diameter measurements was found between graduated catheter aortography and CTA in all cases. CTA values were a mean of 1.74 mm higher than aortography values. Pearson's correlation indicates a strong correlation between both techniques, and a regression equation determines the predictive value of aortography on the basis of CTA values. Estimation of the transverse diameter of the proximal neck on aortography on the basis of that obtained on CTA allows us to affirm that CTA could be used as the sole method for the preoperative selection of appropriate endograft size in patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysm.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1373,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.003292236,0

The interaction between the amino-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 and TFIIH is directly correlated with the ability of p53 to activate both transcription initiation and elongation. We have identified a region within the p53 TAD that specifically interacts with the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the p62 and Tfb1 subunits of human and yeast TFIIH. We have solved the 3D structure of a complex between the p53 TAD and the PH domain of Tfb1 by NMR spectroscopy. Our structure reveals that p53 forms a nine residue amphipathic alpha helix (residues 47-55) upon binding to Tfb1. In addition, we demonstrate that diphosphorylation of p53 at Ser46 and Thr55 leads to a significant enhancement in p53 binding to p62 and Tfb1.

Chk2 activation is initiated by phosphorylation of Thr68, in the serine-glutamine/threonine-glutamine cluster domain (SCD), by ATM. The phosphorylated SCD-segment binds to the FHA domain of a second Chk2 molecule, promoting dimerisation of the protein and triggering phosphorylation of the activation segment/T-loop in the kinase domain. We have now determined the structure of the kinase domain of human Chk2 in complexes with ADP and a small-molecule inhibitor debromohymenialdisine. The structure reveals a remarkable dimeric arrangement in which T-loops are exchanged between protomers, to form an active kinase conformation in trans.

16830528,"Temporal bioavailability of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs. Because PCBs and organochlorine pesticides continue to be of global concern, studies that address information gaps, such as factors and influences of spatial and temporal effects on contaminant bioavailability, are valuable. The present study focused on the spatial and temporal distribution of bioavailable organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in surface waters of a contaminated harbor. Passive sampling devices were intensively deployed adjacent to various land uses on the Willamette River, OR, including Portland Harbor and McCormick and Baxter Superfund sites, during summer and fall, extreme conditions, 2001-2004. An increase of bioavailable sigmaDDTs (sum of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD, and p,p'-DDE) concentrations was strongly affected bythe local historic production of DDTs and temporal changes in river conditions. The increase of bioavailable p,p'-DDD and high DDD/DDE ratios observed during summer indicates conditions favoring anaerobic reductive processes. In contrast to sigmaDDTs, the bioavailable concentrations and daily loads of dieldrin and PCBs increased during fall, especially during episodic rainstorms. On the basis of the PCB congener profiles, PCB inputs from urban runoff /sewer overflows were considered likely current sources of bioavailable PCB into the Harbor. The exceedence of the U.S. national and Oregon water quality criteria was a function of the temporal variability of each bioavailable contaminant.

16879648,"Structural and biochemical characterization of a mitochondrial peroxiredoxin from Plasmodium falciparum. INTRODUCTION. Peroxiredoxins (Prx) are ubiquitous peroxidases that reduce reactive oxygen and nitrogen species such as hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides and peroxinitrite using an active-site cysteine residue (Bryk et al., 2000; Hofmann et al., 2002). The reducing equivalents required for these reactions are provided by thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, alkylhydroperoxide reductase, glutathione or cyclophilin (Lee et al., 2001; Rouhier et al., 2002; Wood et al., 2002; Echalier et al., 2005). Prx are generally highly abundant proteins, possibly to compensate for their relatively low catalytic activities compared with those of other peroxidases such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase (Hofmann et al., 2002). In addition to their antioxidant functions Prx have roles in signal transduction pathways that use hydrogen peroxide as a second messenger (Wood et al., 2003a; Veal et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2005; Okazaki et al., 2005; Rhee et al., 2005). According to their structural and catalytic features, Prx are divided into five classes (Echalier et al., 2005). A common characteristic of Prx is the presence of a highly conserved cysteine, the peroxidatic cysteine (Cp), in the N-terminal domain of the protein, which accepts the hydroperoxide substrate and forms a cysteine sulphenic acid (Cys-SOH) intermediate during the catalytic cycle (Wood et al., 2003a). In 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, this active-site residue is found in the first turn of an α-helix that is able to unwind to form a disulphide bridge with a second cysteine, the resolving cysteine (Cr), close to the C-terminus of the same or another subunit of the dimeric protein (Evrard et al., 2004; Echalier et al., 2005; Rhee et al., 2005). Oneother striking feature of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins is their alternation between oligomeric states – in the reduced state, typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are (α2)5 decamers and in the oxidized state these decamers are typically destabilized and resolved into homodimers (Wood et al., 2002; 2003a, b; Echalier et al., 2005). However, among 2-Cys peroxiredoxins from different sources, the tendency to form higher oligomers appears to differ. AhpC from Salmonella typhimurium, for instance, has been structurally analysed and both reduced and oxidized states were found to be decameric in the crystal structure. (Wood et al., 2002). A recent structure of an oxidized form of AhpC from Mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed a dodecamer structure consisting of six, rather than five, dimers arranged as a doughnut-like ring (Guimaraes et al., 2005). The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum possesses five different peroxiredoxins – two [P. falciparum 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (PfTrx-Px1) and P. falciparum mitochondrial peroxiredoxin (PfTrx-Px2)] show a high degree of sequence similarity to typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Krnajski et al., 2001; Rahlfs and Becker, 2001) and two [P. falciparum 1-Cys peroxiredoxin (PfTrx-Px3) and PfAOP (AOP: antioxidant protein)] are 1-Cys peroxiredoxins (Kawazu et al., 2000; Krnajski et al., 2001; Sarma et al., 2005). The fifth is a glutathione peroxidase-like protein [P. falciparum glutathione peroxidase-like protein (PfTrx-G1)] that prefers thioredoxin as a reductant (Sztajer et al., 2001). PfTrx-G1 has been biochemically characterized and shows catalytic efficiencies comparable to thioredoxin-dependent peroxidases from other sources (kcat/Km∼ 103−104 M−1 s−1) whereas the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin PfTrx-Px1 reduces hydrogen peroxide with a higher catalytic efficiency of 106 M−1 s−1 (Akerman and Müller, 2003). The biochemical and catalytic features of all other Plasmodium peroxiredoxins have not been analysed yet and structural information is available only for PfAOP (Sarma et al., 2005). Given that the parasites lack catalase and glutathione peroxidase, it has been suggested that peroxiredoxins are key antioxidants that guarantee parasite survival under enhanced oxidative stress (Müller, 2004). However, there appears to be redundancy among the various Prx in Plasmodium as the knockout of PfTrx-Px1 is not lethal although the null mutants show an increased sensitivity towards hydrogen peroxide and peroxinitrite (Komaki-Yasuda et al., 2003). On the other hand, interruption of the thioredoxin redox cycle, by disruption of the gene encoding thioredoxin reductase, is fatal for the parasites, suggesting that their thioredoxin-dependent peroxiredoxin-linked antioxidant system plays a crucial function in defence against oxidative insults (Krnajski et al., 2002). Like other eukaryotes, P. falciparum needs to avoid oxidative insults to its organelles, the mitochondrion and the apicoplast. The mitochondrial respiratory chain results in the formation of superoxide anions that are dismutated by a mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD; Sienkiewicz et al., 2004). The resulting hydrogen peroxide has to be removed to prevent oxidative injury to the organelle and this is likely to be achieved by a mitochondrial peroxiredoxin-linked detoxification system as has been reported for mammals and yeast (Miranda-Vizuete et al., 2000; Wheeler and Grant, 2004). A potential mitochondrial peroxiredoxin gene of P. falciparum (pftrx-px2) has previously been cloned and recombinantly expressed but no further biochemical characterization of the protein was performed (Rahlfs and Becker, 2001). Immunofluorescent studies using polyclonal antibodies raised against the protein suggest a mitochondrial localization (Yano et al., 2005). In this study, we report the biochemical and structural characterization of PfTrx-Px2 and identify its mitochondrial reducing partner as well as the localization of both proteins to the mitochondrion in parasites. Our results show that PfTrx-Px2 is a thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase with a preference for H2O2 and that it structurally belongs to the class of typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins. These data suggest an important function of the PfTrx-Px2-linked detoxification of reactive oxygen species in the parasite's mitochondrio",PMC,pos,1,pos,1393,pos_PMC,0.99629277,1

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is caused by mutations in the PKHD1 (polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1) gene on chromosome 6p12. The longest continuous open reading frame comprises 66 exons encoding a novel 4,074 aa multidomain integral membrane protein (polyductin/fibrocystin) of unknown function. Various alternatively spliced transcripts may additionally result in different isoproteins. Overall, the large size of PKHD1, its complex pattern of splicing, multiple allelism and lack of knowledge of the encoded protein's/proteins' functions pose significant challenges to DNA-based diagnostic testing. Nucleotide substitutions, particularly if residing in regulatory elements or introns outside the splice consensus sites, are often difficult to assess without further functional analyses and cannot be unambiguously classified as disease-associated. Investigations on the transcript level, however, are hampered as PKHD1 is not widely expressed in blood lymphocytes. We thus determined the functional significance of the novel splice site mutation c.53-3C>A in intron 2 by RNA analyses by minigene-construction. The mutant allele was shown to cause skipping of exon 3. Thus, given the minigene results together with 400 control chromosomes negative for this change, segregation of the mutation with the phenotype, and a significant lowering of the strength of the splice site by bioinformatics, the mutant allele is most likely pathogenic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that defines the consequences of a PKHD1 splice mutation and underlines the relevance of functional analyses in determining the pathogenicity of changes of unknown significance.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1402,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.5808425,1
16906136,"NMDA-receptor-mediated, cell-specific integration of new neurons in adult dentate gyrus. New neurons are continuously integrated into existing neural circuits in adult dentate gyrus of the mammalian brain. Accumulating evidence indicates that these new neurons are involved in learning and memory. A substantial fraction of newly born neurons die before they mature and the survival of new neurons is regulated in an experience-dependent manner, raising the possibility that the selective survival or death of new neurons has a direct role in a process of learning and memory--such as information storage--through the information-specific construction of new circuits. However, a critical assumption of this hypothesis is that the survival or death decision of new neurons is information-specific. Because neurons receive their information primarily through their input synaptic activity, we investigated whether the survival of new neurons is regulated by input activity in a cell-specific manner. Here we developed a retrovirus-mediated, single-cell gene knockout technique in mice and showed that the survival of new neurons is competitively regulated by their own NMDA-type glutamate receptor during a short, critical period soon after neuronal birth. This finding indicates that the survival of new neurons and the resulting formation of new circuits are regulated in an input-dependent, cell-specific manner. Therefore, the circuits formed by new neurons may represent information associated with input activity within a short time window in the critical period. This information-specific addition of new circuits through selective survival or death of new neurons may be a unique attribute of new neurons that enables them to play a critical role in learning and memory.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1407,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.002225671,0
16935371,"Comparison of enzyme-linked immunomagnetic chemiluminescence with U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Bacteriological Analytical Manual method for the detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Escherichia coli O157:H7, a major foodborne pathogen, has been associated with numerous cases of foodborne illnesses. Rapid methods have been developed for the screening of this pathogen in foods in order to circumvent timely plate culture techniques. Unfortunately, many rapid methods are presumptive and do not claim to confirm the presence of E. coli O157:H7. The previously developed method, enzyme-linked immunomagnetic chemiluminescence (ELIMCL), has been improved upon to allow for fewer incidences of false positives when used to detect E. coli O157:H7 in the presence of mixed cultures. The key feature of this assay is that it combines the highly selective synergism of both anti-O157 and anti-H7 antibodies in the sandwich immunoassay format. This work presents application of a newly semi-automated version of ELIMCL to the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in pristine buffered saline yielding detection limits of approximately 1 x 10(5) to 1 x 10(6) of live cells/mL. ELIMCL was further demonstrated to detect E. coli O157:H7 inoculated into artificially contaminated ground beef at ca. 400 CFU/g after a 5 h enrichment and about 1.5 h assay time for a total detection time of about 6.5 h.

We compared the safety and efficacy of alternating deferoxamine and deferiprone with that of deferoxamine monotherapy. Sixty transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients regularly treated with deferoxamine were randomized to continue deferoxamine alone or to receive an alternating therapy for one year. Both arms resulted in equivalent decreases of serum ferritin and liver iron concentration.

16979660,"Structural basis of interaction between urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor. Recent studies indicate that binding of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) to its high-affinity receptor (uPAR) orchestrates uPAR interactions with other cellular components that play a pivotal role in diverse (patho-)physiological processes, including wound healing, angiogenesis, inflammation, and cancer metastasis. However, notwithstanding the wealth of biochemical data available describing the activities of uPAR, little is known about the exact mode of uPAR/uPA interactions or the presumed conformational changes that accompany uPA/uPAR engagement. Here, we report the crystal structure of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), which contains the three domains of the wild-type receptor but lacks the cell-surface anchoring sequence, in complex with the amino-terminal fragment of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (ATF), at the resolution of 2.8 A. We report the 1.9 A crystal structure of free ATF.

16981686,"Implications for viral capsid assembly from crystal structures of HIV-1 Gag(1-278) and CA(N)(133-278). Gag, the major structural protein of retroviruses such as HIV-1, comprises a series of domains connected by flexible linkers. These domains drive viral assembly by mediating multiple interactions between adjacent Gag molecules and by binding to viral genomic RNA and host cell membranes. Upon viral budding, Gag is processed by the viral protease to liberate distinct domains as separate proteins. The first two regions of Gag are MA, a membrane-binding module, and CA, which is a two-domain protein that makes important Gag-Gag interactions, forms the cone-shaped outer shell of the core (the capsid) in the mature HIV-1 particle, and makes an important interaction with the cellular protein cyclophilin A (CypA). Here, we report crystal structures of the mature CA N-terminal domain (CA(N)(133-278)) and a MA-CA(N) fusion (Gag(1-278)) at resolutions/R(free) values of 1.9 A/25.7% and 2.2 A/25.8%, respectively. Consistent with earlier studies, a comparison of these structures indicates that processing at the MA-CA junction causes CA to adopt an N-terminal beta-hairpin conformation that seems to be required for capsid morphology and viral infectivity. In contrast with an NMR study (Tang, C., et al. (2002) Nat. Struct. Biol. 9, 537-543), structural overlap reveals only small relative displacements for helix 6, which is located between the beta-hairpin and the CypA-binding loop. These observations argue against the proposal that CypA binding is coupled with beta-hairpin formation and support an earlier surface plasmon resonance study (Yoo, S., et al. (1997) J. Mol. Biol. 269, 780-795), which concluded that beta-hairpin formation and CypA-binding are energetically independent events.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1426,pos_MEDLINE,0.99696034,1

The Arabidopsis HY5 protein is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that promotes photomorphogenesis. HY5 binds directly to the promoters of light responsible element containing the G-box and thus regulates their transcriptional activity. The level and activity of HY5 are negatively regulated, in a light-dependent manner, by interaction with the COP1 protein, which targets HY5 for proteasome-mediated degradation in the nucleus. Despite its essential roles in plant development, no structural information exists for HY5. In this article, we report the first structural and biophysical characterization of HY5. Using limited proteolysis in combination with mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we have deduced that the N-terminal 77 amino acids of HY5 form a premolten globular structure, while amino acids 78-110, which constitute the basic region (BR) of the protein, exist in a molten globule state. Our studies also revealed that the overall structural features of full-length HY5 are dominated largely by the disordered N-terminal domain, despite the existence of a bZIP domain at its C-terminus. We propose that HY5 is a member of the intrinsically unstructured protein (IUP) family, and that HY5 functions as an unstructured protein and benefits from being the same, in vivo.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1429,pos_MEDLINE,0.9979532,1
17002283,"Carboxyl terminus of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid protein: self-association analysis and nucleic acid binding characterization. Coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein envelops the genomic RNA to form long helical nucleocapsid during virion assembly. Since N protein oligomerization is usually a crucial step in this process, characterization of such an oligomerization will help in the understanding of the possible mechanisms for nucleocapsid formation. The N protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was recently discovered to self-associate by its carboxyl terminus. In this study, to further address the detailed understanding of the association feature of this C-terminus, its oligomerization was systematically investigated by size exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking assays. Our results clearly indicated that the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV N protein could form not only dimers but also trimers, tetramers, and hexamers. Further analyses against six deletion mutants showed that residues 343-402 were necessary and sufficient for this C-terminus oligomerization. Although this segment contains many charged residues, differences in ionic strength have no effects on its oligomerization, indicating the absence of electrostatic force in SARS-CoV N protein C-terminus self-association. Gel shift assay results revealed that the SARS-CoV N protein C-terminus is also able to associate with nucleic acids and residues 363-382 are the responsible interaction partner, demonstrating that this fragment might involve genomic RNA binding sites. The fact that nucleic acid binding could promote the SARS-CoV N protein C-terminus to form high-order oligomers implies that the oligomeric SARS-CoV N protein probably combines with the viral genomic RNA in triggering long nucleocapsid formation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1430,pos_MEDLINE,0.9920773,1

The ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) with 147 amino acid residues has been identified as a calcium-binding protein, expressed specifically in microglia/macrophages, and is expected to be a key factor in membrane ruffling, which is a typical feature of activated microglia. We have determined the crystal structure of human Iba1 in a Ca(2+)-free form and mouse Iba1 in a Ca(2+)-bound form, to a resolution of 1.9 A and 2.1 A, respectively. X-ray structures of Iba1 revealed a compact, single-domain protein with two EF-hand motifs, showing similarity in overall topology to partial structures of the classical EF-hand proteins troponin C and calmodulin. In mouse Iba1, the second EF-hand contains a bound Ca(2+), but the first EF-hand does not, which is often the case in S100 proteins, suggesting that Iba1 has S100 protein-like EF-hands. The molecular conformational change induced by Ca(2+)-binding of Iba1 is different from that found in the classical EF-hand proteins and/or S100 proteins, which demonstrates that Iba1 has an unique molecular switching mechanism dependent on Ca(2+)-binding, to interact with target molecules.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1438,pos_MEDLINE,0.99770385,1

Taking benefit of previously obtained results, stable complex organic-inorganic hybrid suspensions are successfully prepared by mixing a polystyrene latex aqueous suspension, a titania hydrosol and a nonionic triblock copolymer. These suspensions can be then deposited as thin films on dense or porous substrates. Solvent evaporation induces the formation of spherical micelles by self-assembly of the amphiphilic molecules during the drying of the films. Two types of isolated spherical macropores (few ten nanometers) and mesopores (4-5 nm) are generated inside the layers by the thermal removal of the polystyrene particles and of the micelles, respectively. The remaining inorganic network exhibits an additional interconnected microporosity with a mean pore size of 1.5 nm, resulting from the aggregation of the anatase nanoparticles. A complete removal of the templating units at low temperature is possible using the photocatalytic properties of the anatase network.

Inositol polyphosphates perform essential functions as second messengers in eukaryotic cells, and their cellular levels are regulated by inositol phosphate kinases. Most of these enzymes belong to the inositol phosphate kinase superfamily, which consists of three subgroups, inositol 3-kinases, inositol phosphate multikinases, and inositol hexakisphosphate kinases. Family members share several strictly conserved signature motifs and are expected to have the same backbone fold, despite very limited overall amino acid sequence identity. Sequence differences are expected to play important roles in defining the different substrate selectivity of these enzymes. To investigate the structural basis for substrate specificity, we have determined the crystal structure of the yeast inositol phosphate multikinase Ipk2 in the apoform and in a complex with ADP and Mn(2+) at up to 2.0A resolution. The overall structure of Ipk2 is related to inositol trisphosphate 3-kinase. The ATP binding site is similar in both enzymes; however, the inositol binding domain is significantly smaller in Ipk2.

Regulation of these genes in response to the organism being challenged with galactose has served as a paradigm for eukaryotic transcriptional control over the last 50 years. Three proteins, the activator Gal4p, the repressor Gal80p, and the ligand sensor Gal3p, control the switch between inert and active gene expression. Gal80p, the focus of this investigation, plays a pivotal role both in terms of repressing the activity of Gal4p and allowing the GAL switch to respond to galactose. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of Gal80p from Kluyveromyces lactis and show that it is structurally homologous to glucose-fructose oxidoreductase, an enzyme in the sorbitol-gluconate pathway. Our results clearly define the overall tertiary and quaternary structure of Gal80p and suggest that Gal4p and Gal3p bind to Gal80p at distinct but overlapping sites. In addition to providing a molecular basis for previous biochemical and genetic studies, our structure demonstrates that much of the enzymatic scaffold of the oxidoreductase has been maintained in Gal80p, but it is utilized in a very different manner to facilitate transcriptional regulation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1467,pos_MEDLINE,0.99783,1

NAPc2, an anticoagulant protein from the hematophagous nematode Ancylostoma caninum evaluated in phase-II/IIa clinical trials, inhibits the extrinsic blood coagulation pathway by a two step mechanism, initially interacting with the hitherto uncharacterized factor Xa exosite involved in macromolecular recognition and subsequently inhibiting factor VIIa (K(i)=8.4 pM) of the factor VIIa/tissue factor complex. NAPc2 is highly flexible, becoming partially ordered and undergoing significant structural changes in the C terminus upon binding to the factor Xa exosite.

Multichain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs) found on the surface of T cells, B cells, mast cells, natural killer cells, basophils, and other immune cells are formed by the association of several single-pass transmembrane proteins, with immunoglobulin-like ligand recognition domains and signal-transducing domains present on separate subunits. The MIRR signaling subunits all have cytoplasmic domains containing one or more copies of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), tyrosine residues of which are phosphorylated upon receptor engagement in an early and obligatory event in the signaling cascade. Despite the proximity to the cell membrane and crucial role in transmembrane signal transduction, little is known about the structure and lipid-binding activity of the ITAM-containing cytoplasmic domains. Here we investigate the conformation and lipid-binding activity of several MIRR cytoplasmic domains, namely, T cell receptor zetacyt, CD3epsiloncyt, CD3deltacyt, and CD3gammacyt, B cell receptor Igalphacyt and Igbetacyt, and Fc receptor FcepsilonRIgammacyt, using purified recombinant proteins. Secondary structure prediction analysis and experimental circular dichroism spectra identify each of these cytoplasmic domains as natively unfolded proteins. We also report that zetacyt, CD3epsiloncyt, and FcepsilonRIgammacyt bind to acidic and mixed phospholipid vesicles and that the binding strength correlates with the protein net charge and the presence of clustered basic amino acid residues. Circular dichroism analysis reveals the lack of secondary structure for these domains in lipid-bound form. Phosphorylation of zetacyt and FcepsilonRIgammacyt does not alter their random-coil conformation but weakens binding to membranes.

Sir3p self-associates extensively in moderate salt and at micromolar protein concentrations producing a broad range of oligomers that sediment from 8 to in excess of 85 S.

Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) has an important, but as yet uncharacterised, role in host cell invasion by the malaria parasite, Plasmodium. The protein, which is quite conserved between Plasmodium species, comprises an ectoplasmic region, a single transmembrane segment and a small cytoplasmic domain. The ectoplasmic region, which can induce protective immunity in animal models of human malaria, is a leading vaccine candidate that has entered clinical trials. The monoclonal antibody F8.12.19, raised against the recombinant ectoplasmic region of AMA1 from Plasmodium vivax, cross-reacts with homologues from Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium cynomolgi, Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium falciparum, as shown by immunofluorescence assays on mature schizonts. The binding of F8.12.19 to recombinant AMA1 from both P. vivax and P. falciparum was measured by surface plasmon resonance, revealing an apparent affinity constant that is about 100-fold weaker for the cross-reacting antigen when compared to the cognate antigen. Crystal structure analysis of Fab F8.12.19 complexed to AMA1 from P. vivax and P. falciparum shows that the monoclonal antibody recognises a discontinuous epitope located on domain III of the ectoplasmic region, the major component being a loop containing a cystine knot. The structures provide a basis for understanding the cross-reactivity. Antibody contacts are made mainly to main-chain and invariant side-chain atoms of AMA1; contact antigen residues that differ in sequence are located at the periphery of the antigen-binding site and can be accommodated at the interface between the two components of the complex.

Conserved among all coronaviruses are four structural proteins: the matrix (M), small envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins that are embedded in the viral membrane and the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), which exists in a ribonucleoprotein complex in the lumen. The N-terminal domain of coronaviral N proteins (N-NTD) provides a scaffold for RNA binding, while the C-terminal domain (N-CTD) mainly acts as oligomerization modules during assembly. The C terminus of the N protein anchors it to the viral membrane by associating with M protein. We characterized the structures of N-NTD from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in two crystal forms, at 1.17 A (monoclinic) and at 1.85 A (cubic), respectively, resolved by molecular replacement using the homologous avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) structure. Flexible loops in the solution structure of SARS-CoV N-NTD are now shown to be well ordered around the beta-sheet core. The functionally important positively charged beta-hairpin protrudes out of the core, is oriented similarly to that in the IBV N-NTD, and is involved in crystal packing in the monoclinic form. In the cubic form, the monomers form trimeric units that stack in a helical array. Comparison of crystal packing of SARS-CoV and IBV N-NTDs suggests a common mode of RNA recognition, but they probably associate differently in vivo during the formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex. Electrostatic potential distribution on the surface of homology models of related coronaviral N-NTDs suggests that they use different modes of both RNA recognition and oligomeric assembly, perhaps explaining why their nucleocapsids have different morphologies.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1502,pos_MEDLINE,0.9973374,1

Neurabin and spinophilin are neuronal scaffolding proteins that play important roles in the regulation of synaptic transmission through their ability to target protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to dendritic spines where PP1 dephosphorylates and inactivates glutamate receptors. However, thus far, it is still unknown how neurabin and spinophilin themselves are targeted to these membrane receptors. Spinophilin and neurabin contain a single PDZ domain, a common protein-protein interaction recognition motif, which are 86% identical in sequence. We report the structures of both the neurabin and spinophilin PDZ domains determined using biomolecular NMR spectroscopy. These proteins form the canonical PDZ domain fold. However, despite their high degree of sequence identity, there are distinct and significant structural differences between them, especially between the peptide binding pockets. Using two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC NMR analysis, we demonstrate that C-terminal peptide ligands derived from glutamatergic AMPA and NMDA receptors and cytosolic proteins directly and differentially bind spinophilin and neurabin PDZ domains. This peptide binding data also allowed us to classify the neurabin and spinophilin PDZ domains as the first identified neuronal hybrid class V PDZ domains, which are capable of binding both class I and II peptides. Finally, the ability to bind to glutamate receptor subunits suggests that the PDZ domains of neurabin and spinophilin are important for targeting PP1 to C-terminal phosphorylation sites in AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1511,pos_MEDLINE,0.998147,1

We determined the crystal structures of MIM's IMD and that of its WH2 bound to actin. The IMD forms a dimer, with each subunit folded as an antiparallel three-helix bundle. This fold is related to that of the BAR domain. Like the BAR domain, the IMD has been implicated in membrane binding. Yet, comparison of the structures reveals that the membrane binding surfaces of the two domains have opposite curvatures, which may determine the type of curvature of the interacting membrane.

The location of intrinsic disorder in the MeCP2 sequence was predicted using the FoldIndex algorithm. MeCP2 was found to be monomeric in low and high salt and over a nearly 1000-fold concentration range. CD indicated that the MeCP2 monomer was nearly 60% unstructured under conditions where it could preferentially recognize CpG dinucleotides and condense chromatin. Protease digestion experiments demonstrate that MeCP2 is composed of at least six structurally distinct domains, two of which correspond to the well characterized methyl DNA binding domain and transcriptional repression domain. These domains collectively are organized into a tertiary structure with coil-like hydrodynamic properties, reflecting the extensive disorder in the MeCP2 sequence. When expressed as individual fragments, the methyl DNA binding domain and transcriptional repression domain both could function as nonspecific DNA binding domains.

Multiple truncations of each PDZ domain were generated. The four residue extensions, which represent known specificity sequences of the target PDZ domains and cover both class I and II motifs, form intermolecular contacts in the expected manner for the interactions of PDZ domains with protein C termini for both classes.

Here we present the crystal structures of the Arabidopsis TIR1-ASK1 complex, free and in complexes with three different auxin compounds and an Aux/IAA substrate peptide. These structures show that the leucine-rich repeat domain of TIR1 contains an unexpected inositol hexakisphosphate co-factor and recognizes auxin and the Aux/IAA polypeptide substrate through a single surface pocket. Anchored to the base of the TIR1 pocket, auxin binds to a partially promiscuous site, which can also accommodate various auxin analogues. Docked on top of auxin, the Aux/IAA substrate peptide occupies the rest of the TIR1 pocket and completely encloses the hormone-binding site.

The transcriptional coactivator p300 binds to and mediates the transcriptional functions of the tetrameric tumor suppressor p53. Both proteins consist of independently folded domains linked by intrinsically disordered sequences. A well studied short sequence of the p53 transactivation domain, p53(15-29), binds weakly to four folded domains of p300 [Taz1/cysteine-histidine-rich region 1 (CH1), Kix, Taz2/CH3, IBiD], with dissociation constants (K(D)) in the 100 muM region. However, we found that a longer N-terminal transactivation domain construct p53(1-57) bound tightly to each p300 domain. Taz2/CH3 had the greatest affinity (K(D) = 27 nM) and competes with the N-terminal domain of Mdm2 for the p53 N terminus. p300 thus can protect the N terminus of p53 against the binding of other proteins. Mutations of p53 that abrogate transactivation (L22Q/W23S, W53Q/F54S) greatly weakened binding to each p300 domain, linking phenotypic defects to weakened coactivator binding. We propose a complex between tetrameric p53 and p300 in which four domains of p300 wrap around the four transactivation domains of p53.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1554,pos_MEDLINE,0.9964688,1
17473007,"Crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of splicing factor Prp8 carrying retinitis pigmentosa mutants. Prp8 is a critical pre-mRNA splicing factor. Prp8 is proposed to help form and stabilize the spliceosome catalytic core and to be an important regulator of spliceosome activation. Mutations in human Prp8 (hPrp8) cause a severe form of the genetic disorder retinitis pigmentosa, RP13. Understanding the molecular mechanism of Prp8's function in pre-mRNA splicing and RP13 has been hindered by its large size (over 2000 amino acids) and remarkably low-sequence similarity with other proteins. Here we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain (the last 273 residues) of Caenorhabditis elegans Prp8 (cPrp8). The core of the C-terminal domain is an alpha/beta structure that forms the MPN (Mpr1, Pad1 N-terminal) fold but without Zn(2+) coordination. We propose that the C-terminal domain is a protein interaction domain instead of a Zn(2+)-dependent metalloenzyme as proposed for some MPN proteins. Mapping of RP13 mutants on the Prp8 structure suggests that these residues constitute a binding surface between Prp8 and other partner(s), and the disruption of this interaction provides a plausible molecular mechanism for RP13.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1558,pos_MEDLINE,0.9979771,1

Proteins of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family (LRPs) are complex, multimodular type I transmembrane receptors. Productive maturation of these proteins relies on an ER-resident protein called mesoderm development candidate 2 (MESD) in mammals and Boca in Drosophila. We show here that MESD contains a central folded domain flanked by natively unstructured regions required to facilitate maturation of LRP6. Enforced expression of full-length human MESD promotes the secretion of soluble minireceptors derived from LRP6 that contain either one or two beta-propeller-EGF domain pairs. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of human MESD expression blocks secretion of native LRP6 minireceptors and dramatically reduces the level of cell-surface expression of full-length LRP6. Cell-surface expression is only rescued by simultaneous delivery of siRNA-resistant forms of mouse MESD that contain most or all of the unstructured N- and C-termini, implicating the flexible parts of MESD in its function of promoting LRP maturation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1562,pos_MEDLINE,0.9974191,1

The physiological functions of the cellular prion protein, PrP(C), as a cell surface pleiotropic receptor are under debate. We report that PrP(C) interacts with vitronectin but not with fibronectin or collagen. The binding sites mediating this PrP(C)-vitronectin interaction were mapped to residues 105-119 of PrP(C) and the residues 307-320 of vitronectin. The two proteins were co-localized in embryonic dorsal root ganglia from wild-type mice. Vitronectin addition to cultured dorsal root ganglia induced axonal growth, which could be mimicked by vitronectin peptide 307-320 and abrogated by anti-PrP(C) antibodies. Full-length vitronectin, but not the vitronectin peptide 307-320, induced axonal growth of dorsal root neurons from two strains of PrP(C)-null mice. Functional assays demonstrated that relative to wild-type cells, PrP(C)-null dorsal root neurons were more responsive to the Arg-Gly-Asp peptide (an integrin-binding site), and exhibited greater alphavbeta3 activity. Our findings indicate that PrP(C) plays an important role in axonal growth, and this function may be rescued in PrP(C)-knockout animals by integrin compensatory mechanisms.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1565,pos_MEDLINE,0.97517824,1

The fifth HMG-box domain in human upstream binding factor (hUBF) contributes to the synthesis of rRNA by RNA polymerase I (Pol I). The 2.0 A resolution crystal structure of this protein has been solved using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method (SAD). The crystal structure and the reported NMR structure have r.m.s. deviations of 2.18-3.03 A for the C(alpha) atoms. However, there are significant differences between the two structures, with displacements of up to 9.0 A. Compared with other HMG-box structures, the r.m.s. deviations for C(alpha) atoms between hUBF HMG box 5 and HMG domains from Drosophila melanogaster protein D and Rattus norvegicus HMG1 are 1.5 and 1.6 A, respectively. This indicates that the differences between the crystal and NMR structures of hUBF HMG box 5 are larger than those with its homologous structures. The differences between the two structures potentially reflect two states with different structures. The specific interactions between the hUBF HMG box 5 and the first bromodomain of TBP-associated factor 1 (TAF1) were studied by ultrasensitive differential scanning calorimetry and chemical shift perturbation.

Pombe Cdc15 homology (PCH) proteins play an important role in a variety of actin-based processes, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The defining feature of the PCH proteins is an evolutionarily conserved EFC/F-BAR domain for membrane association and tubulation. In the present study, we solved the crystal structures of the EFC domains of human FBP17 and CIP4. The structures revealed a gently curved helical-bundle dimer of approximately 220 A in length, which forms filaments through end-to-end interactions in the crystals. The curved EFC dimer fits a tubular membrane with an approximately 600 A diameter. We subsequently proposed a model in which the curved EFC filament drives tubulation. In fact, striation of tubular membranes was observed by phase-contrast cryo-transmission electron microscopy, and mutations that impaired filament formation also impaired membrane tubulation and cell membrane invagination.

17522259,"Polyelectrostatic interactions of disordered ligands suggest a physical basis for ultrasensitivity. Regulation of biological processes often involves phosphorylation of intrinsically disordered protein regions, thereby modulating protein interactions. Initiation of DNA replication in yeast requires elimination of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 via the SCF(Cdc4) ubiquitin ligase. Intriguingly, the substrate adapter subunit Cdc4 binds to Sic1 only after phosphorylation of a minimum of any six of the nine cyclin-dependent kinase sites on Sic1. To investigate the physical basis of this ultrasensitive interaction, we consider a mean-field statistical mechanical model for the electrostatic interactions between a single receptor site and a conformationally disordered polyvalent ligand. The formulation treats phosphorylation sites as negative contributions to the total charge of the ligand and addresses its interplay with the strength of the favorable ligand-receptor contact. Our model predicts a threshold number of phosphorylation sites for receptor-ligand binding, suggesting that ultrasensitivity in the Sic1-Cdc4 system may be driven at least in part by cumulative electrostatic interactions. This hypothesis is supported by experimental affinities of Cdc4 for Sic1 fragments with different total charges. Thus, polyelectrostatic interactions may provide a simple yet powerful framework for understanding the modulation of protein interactions by multiple phosphorylation sites in disordered protein regions.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1575,pos_MEDLINE,0.99568534,1

17576676,"Structural basis for recognition of cognate tRNA by tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from three kingdoms. INTRODUCTION. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) play a central role in the assembly of amino acids into polypeptide chains. They catalyze the specific esterification of a given amino acid to its corresponding tRNA through a two-step reaction (1). In the first step, the specific amino acid and ATP substrates are recognized and then are converted into a reactive aminoacyl-adenylate (aa-AMP) intermediate in the presence of magnesium ions. In the next step, the amino acid moiety from the aa-AMP is transferred to the 3′-CCA terminus of the cognate tRNA. This enzymatic function is crucial for the fidelity of protein synthesis, in which the genetic code is translated to the amino acid sequence. The primary sequence analyses as well as the tertiary structure determinations allowed the partition of the 20 aaRSs into two exclusive classes, I and II, each consisting of 10 enzymes (2). Each class I enzyme has a Rossmann-fold domain as the catalytic domain. In addition, two consensus motifs, HIGH and KMSKS, are conserved among the class I enzymes. The class I enzymes are further divided into three sub-classes: Ia, Ib and Ic (3,4). The class Ic enzymes are aaRSs for tyrosine and tryptophan and are unusual in that they act as dimers, while the other class I (Ia and Ib) enzymes act as monomers. Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) is the first aaRS to have its crystal structure solved (5). The specific aminoacylation of tRNA by TysRS relies on the identity determinants (the anticodon bases, the C1-G72 base pair, and the discriminator base A73) in the cognate tRNATyr (6–8). To date, a number of crystal structures of the TyrRSs have been solved: they are from four bacteria, Bacillus stearothermophilus [BstTyrRS, (9)], Staphylococcus aureus [SauTyrRS, (10)], Thermus thermophilus [TthTyrRS, (11)] and Escherichia coli [EcoTyrRS, (12)]; from eukarya Homo sapiens [HsaTyrRS, (13)]; and from four archaea, Methanococcus jannaschii [MjaTyrRS, (14,15)], Archaeglobus fulgidus, Pyrococcus horikoshi and Aeropyrum pernix [AfuTyrRS, PhoTyrRS, and ApeTyrRS, respectively, (16)]. Because the archaeal/eukaryotic TyrRSs–tRNATyrs pairs do not cross-react with their bacterial counterparts (8), the recognition modes of the identity determinants by the archaeal and eukaryotic TyrRSs were expected to be similar to each other but different from that by the bacterial TyrRSs. Such orthogonality is used for the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins with engineered pairs of TyrRSs and tRNATyrs (17). In such situations, structural information on archaeal, eukaryotic and bacterial TyrRSs complexed with their cognate tRNATyrs has long been awaited. In a half-decade, crystal structure analyses of bacterial (Thermus thermophilus) (11) and archaeal (Methanococcus jannaschii) (14) TyrRSs complexed with their cognate tRNATyrs have been reported. Although previous experiments showed that TyrRS could bind only one tRNA per dimer (18) in solution, the crystal structure analyses (11,14) have shown that two tRNATyrs are bound to each dimer in a symmetrical fashion in the crystal. A plausible explanation for this discrepancy (asymmetry in solution vs symmetry in crystal) has been described by Yaremchuk et al. (11). A structural comparison revealed the structural basis for orthogonal specificities of archaeal and bacterial TyrRSs (14). On the other hand, no structures are available for eukaryotic TyrRSs complexed with their cognate tRNATyrs. To understand the molecular basis for the recognition of their cognate tRNATyrs by eukaryotic TyrRSs, we initiated the structure analysis of TyrRS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SceTyrRS), the model organism for lower eukaryotes. Here we present the crystal structure at 2.4-Å resolution of the ternary complex of SceTyrRS complexed with a Tyr-AMP analog and the native tRNATyr(GΨA). The present structure of SceTyrRS complexed with the cognate tRNATyr and the previously reported structures of bacterial and archaeal TyrRSs (TthTyrRS and MjaTyrRS, respectively) complexed with their cognate tRNATyrs provide a full set of the recognition modes of the identity determinants of tRNATyrs by TyrRSs from three kingdoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS. CRYSTALLIZATION. Chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). The purification of native modified tRNATyr was performed in a way similar to the method as described (44). A Tyr-AMP analog (O-(adenosine-5′-O-yl) N-(L-tyrosyl)phosphoramidate (Tyr-AMPN), (Figure 1A) was prepared as described (45). We expressed and purified a C-terminally truncated SceTyrRS (hereafter simply SceTyrRS, residues 1–364), which has full TyrRS activity, for the present crystal structure analysis. SceTyrRS was expressed and purified in a way similar to the method described previously for the full-length SceTyrRS (residues 1–394) (34). Crystals of the ternary complex of SceTyrRS were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method, as described elsewhere (46). Briefly, a droplet was prepared by mixing an equal volume of a protein solution containing ca. 0.2 mM SceTyrRS, 5 mM Tyr-AMPN (Figure 1A), ca. 0.2 mM tRNATyr, 40 mM KCl in 20 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.5 and a reservoir solution containing 25% (v/v) polyethyleneglycol 400 (PEG400) and 100 mM CaCl2 in 100 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.5. The crystals belong to tetragonal space group P41212 with cell dimensions of a = b = 63.85 Å and c = 330.3 Å (under the cryogenic conditions described below). Assuming one SceTyrRS subunit and one tRNATyr molecule per asymmetric unit, we obtained a VM value of 2.55 Å3/Da, corresponding to a solvent content of 52%. Since the crystallization conditions of SceTyrRS contained 25% (v/v) PEG400 in reservoir solutions, X-ray data collections could be performed under cryogenic conditions without further addition of a cryo-protectant. Crystals were mounted in nylon loops and flash-cooled in a cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K just before data collection.

Enterobacter cloacae is an emerging clinical pathogen that may be responsible for nosocomial infections. Management of these infections is often difficult, owing to the high frequency of strains that are resistant to disinfectants and antimicrobial agents in the clinical setting. Multidrug efflux pumps, especially those belonging to the resistance-nodulation-division family, play a major role as a mechanism of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative pathogens. In the present study, we cloned and sequenced the genes encoding an AcrAcB-TolC-like efflux pump from an E. cloacae clinical isolate (isolate EcDC64) showing a broad antibiotic resistance profile. Sequence analysis showed that the acrR, acrA, acrB, and tolC genes encode proteins that display 79.8%, 84%, 88%, and 82% amino acid identities with the respective homologues of Enterobacter aerogenes and are arranged in a similar pattern. Deletion of the acrA gene to yield an AcrA-deficient EcDC64 mutant (EcDeltaacrA) showed the involvement of AcrAB-TolC in multidrug resistance in E. cloacae.

The interaction of membrane-embedded voltage-activated potassium channels (Kv) with intracellular scaffold proteins, such as the postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) protein, is mediated by the channel C-terminal segment. This interaction underlies Kv channel clustering at unique membrane sites and is important for the proper assembly and functioning of the synapse. In the current study, we address the molecular mechanism underlying Kv/PSD-95 interaction. We provide experimental evidence, based on hydrodynamic and spectroscopic analyses, indicating that the isolated C-terminal segment of the archetypical Shaker Kv channel (ShB-C) is a random coil, suggesting that ShB-C belongs to the recently defined class of intrinsically disordered proteins. We show that isolated ShB-C is still able to bind its scaffold protein partner and support protein clustering in vivo, indicating that unfoldedness is compatible with ShB-C activity. Pulldown experiments involving C-terminal chains differing in flexibility or length further demonstrate that intrinsic disorder in the C-terminal segment of the Shaker channel modulates its interaction with the PSD-95 protein. Our results thus suggest that the C-terminal domain of the Shaker Kv channel behaves as an entropic chain and support a ""fishing rod"" molecular mechanism for Kv channel binding to scaffold proteins.

PURPOSE Primary open-angle glaucoma is a significant health-economic burden in both the United States and Europe that is likely to increase. This study compared treatment patterns and cost among patients with primary open-angle glaucoma in these locations. METHODS Retrospective medical chart reviews were conducted in the United States (1990 to 2002) and Europe (1995 to 2003). A total sample of 151 US charts and 194 European charts was studied, and patients were assigned a baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) and baseline stage, using a 6-stage visual functional glaucoma staging algorithm. Resource utilization and direct costs were assessed by stage of disease using publicly available United States and European costs. Cox Proportional Hazards modeling were used to examine covariates predicting glaucoma surgery. Total cost was predicted, adjusting for covariates using Generalized Linear Models, with baseline stage as the independent variable. RESULTS Glaucoma surgery requirement was highly associated with baseline disease stage and IOP increase before surgery in the United States and somewhat associated with these factors in Europe. Within both locations, baseline IOP was highly associated with glaucoma surgery requirement. Controlling for covariates, patients at higher baseline stages incurred greater costs in the United States (P=0.0017) and Europe (P=0.0715). Surgery and medication were also highly predictive of increased cost (P<0.0001). Cost of care differed greatly between the European countries, with costs lowest in Italy.

Relative to other parvalbumin isoforms, the mammalian beta-parvalbumin (oncomodulin) displays attenuated divalent ion affinity. High-resolution structural data for the Ca(2+)-bound protein have provided little insight into the physical basis for this behavior, prompting an examination of the unliganded state. This article describes the solution structure and peptide backbone dynamics of Ca(2+)-free rat beta-parvalbumin (beta-PV). Ca(2+) removal evidently provokes significant structural alterations. Interaction between the D helix and the AB domain in the Ca(2+)-bound protein is greatly diminished in the apo-form, permitting the D helix to straighten. There is also a significant reorganization of the hydrophobic core and a concomitant remodeling of the interface between the AB and CD-EF domains. These modifications perturb the orientation of the C and D helices, and the energetic penalty associated with their reversal could contribute to the low-affinity signature of the CD site. By contrast, Ca(2+) removal causes a comparatively minor perturbation of the E and F helices, consistent with the more typical divalent ion affinity observed for the EF site. Ca(2+)-free rat beta-PV retains structural rigidity on the picosecond-nanosecond timescale.

The signal-recognition particle (SRP) is a ubiquitous protein-RNA complex that targets proteins to cellular membranes for insertion or secretion. A key player in SRP-mediated protein targeting is the evolutionarily conserved core consisting of the SRP RNA and the multidomain protein SRP54. Communication between the SRP54 domains is critical for SRP function, where signal sequence binding at the M domain directs receptor binding at the GTPase domain (NG domain). These SRP activities are linked to domain rearrangements, for which the role of SRP RNA is not clear. In free SRP, a direct interaction of the GTPase domain with SRP RNA has been proposed but has never been structurally verified. In this study, we present the crystal structure at 2.5-A resolution of the SRP54-SRP19-SRP RNA complex of Methanococcus jannaschii SRP. The structure reveals an RNA-bound conformation of the SRP54 GTPase domain, in which the domain is spatially well separated from the signal peptide binding site.

In this article, it is demonstrated that calreticulin is a high affinity ligand of GABARAP.

By phage display screening of a randomized peptide library, peptides that specifically bind GABARAP were identified. Their amino acid sequences allowed us to identify calreticulin as a potential GABARAP binding protein. GABARAP binding to calreticulin was confirmed by pull-down experiments with brain lysate and colocalization studies in N2a cells.

Members of the (L)Sm (Sm and Sm-like) protein family are found across all kingdoms of life and play crucial roles in RNA metabolism.

EDC3 is composed of a N-terminal LSm domain, a central FDF domain, and a C-terminal YjeF-N domain. We show that this modular architecture enables EDC3 to interact with multiple components of the decapping machinery, including DCP1, DCP2, and Me31B. The LSm domain mediates DCP1 binding and P-body localization. We determined the three-dimensional structures of the LSm domains of Drosophila melanogaster and human EDC3 and show that the domain adopts a divergent Sm fold that lacks the characteristic N-terminal alpha-helix and has a disrupted beta4-strand. This domain remains monomeric in solution and lacks several features that canonical (L)Sm domains require for binding RNA. The structures also revealed a conserved patch of surface residues that are required for the interaction with DCP1 but not for P-body localization.

Despite the well-described functionality and physiological activity of this system in E. coli, no structural study was performed on the folding and stability of the protein pair in solution. Here we structurally and thermodynamically characterize the RelBE system components from E. coli in solution, both separately and in their complexed state. The RelB antitoxin, an alpha-helical protein according to circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy, forms oligomers in solution, exhibits high thermostability with a TM of 58.5 degrees C, has a considerable heat resistance, and has high unfolding reversibility. In contrast, the RelE toxin includes a large portion of antiparallel beta-sheets, displays lower thermostability with a TM of 52.5 degrees C, and exhibits exceptional sensitivity to heat. Complex formation, accompanied by a structural transition, leads to a 12 degrees C increase in the TM and substantial heat resistance. Moreover, in vivo interaction and protein footprint experiments indicate that the C-terminal part of RelB is responsible for RelB-RelE interaction, being protease sensitive in its free state, while it becomes protected from proteolysis when complexed with RelE. Overall, our findings support the notion that RelB lacks a well-organized hydrophobic core in solution whereas RelE is a well-folded protein. Furthermore, our results support that RelB protein from E. coli is similar to ParD and CcdA antitoxins in both fold and thermodynamic properties. The differential folding state of the proteins is discussed in the context of their physiological activities.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1672,pos_MEDLINE,0.9975514,1
18032669,"Alcohol regulates gene expression in neurons via activation of heat shock factor 1. Drinking alcohol causes widespread alterations in gene expression that can result in long-term physiological changes. Although many alcohol-responsive genes (ARGs) have been identified, the mechanisms by which alcohol alters transcription are not well understood. To elucidate these mechanisms, we investigated Gabra4, a neuron-specific gene that is rapidly and robustly activated by alcohol (10-60 mM), both in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that alcohol can activate elements of the heat shock pathway in mouse cortical neurons to enhance the expression of Gabra4 and other ARGs. The activation of Gabra4 by alcohol or high temperature is dependent on the binding of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) to a short downstream DNA sequence, the alcohol response element (ARE). Alcohol and heat stimulate the translocation of HSF1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and the induction of HSF1-dependent genes, Hsp70 and Hsp90, in cultured neurons and in the mouse cerebral cortex in vivo. The reduction of HSF1 levels using small interfering RNA prevented the stimulation of Gabra4 and Hsp70 by alcohol and heat shock. Microarray analysis showed that many ARGs contain ARE-like sequences and that some of these genes are also activated by heat shock. We suggest that alcohol activates phylogenetically conserved pathways that involve intermediates in the heat shock cascade and that sequence elements similar to the ARE may mediate some of the changes in gene expression triggered by alcohol intake, which could be important in a variety of pathophysiological responses to alcohol.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1703,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.03132112,0
18093982,"A structural-dynamical characterization of human Cox17. Human Cox17 is a key mitochondrial copper chaperone responsible for supplying copper ions, through the assistance of Sco1, Sco2, and Cox11, to cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial energy transducing respiratory chain. A structural and dynamical characterization of human Cox17 in its various functional metallated and redox states is presented here. The NMR solution structure of the partially oxidized Cox17 (Cox17(2S-S)) consists of a coiled coil-helix-coiled coil-helix domain stabilized by two disulfide bonds involving Cys(25)-Cys(54) and Cys(35)-Cys(44), preceded by a flexible and completely unstructured N-terminal tail. In human Cu(I)Cox17(2S-S) the copper(I) ion is coordinated by the sulfurs of Cys(22) and Cys(23), and this is the first example of a Cys-Cys binding motif in copper proteins. Copper(I) binding as well as the formation of a third disulfide involving Cys(22) and Cys(23) cause structural and dynamical changes only restricted to the metal-binding region. Redox properties of the disulfides of human Cox17, here investigated, strongly support the current hypothesis that the unstructured fully reduced Cox17 protein is present in the cytoplasm and enters the intermembrane space (IMS) where is then oxidized by Mia40 to Cox17(2S-S), thus becoming partially structured and trapped into the IMS. Cox17(2S-S) is the functional species in the IMS, it can bind only one copper(I) ion and is then ready to enter the pathway of copper delivery to cytochrome c oxidase. The copper(I) form of Cox17(2S-S) has features specific for copper chaperones.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1718,pos_MEDLINE,0.99784267,1

The effects of misoprostol and cimetidine on diazepam pharmacokinetics were evaluated in order to determine whether the kinetic variables for diazepam and nordiazepam alone differ with the repeated oral administration of misoprostol and cimetidine to healthy adult volunteers. The trial was conducted as an open crossover study in 12 normal subjects, divided into two groups with all subjects receiving both regimens. Total study duration was 5 weeks. An initial clinical assessment, including blood biochemistry and assessment of subject oxidation status was carried out on study day 1. On this day, subjects began taking diazepam (10 mg) orally for one week, with pharmacokinetic studies performed at day 8, when steady state levels of diazepam were reached. This was followed by one week with active drug, misoprostol to Group I and cimetidine to Group II, with pharmacokinetic studies performed at the end of a 1-week treatment. After a 2-week wash-out period, both groups took for one week, the alternate drug, i.e. cimetidine plus diazepam to Group I and misoprostol plus diazepam to Group II. On days 8, 15 and 36, subjects were admitted to the hospital for 12 h, during which time a clinical examination was carried out and blood samples were taken at time zero and at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36 h post-dosing for the measurement of serum diazepam and nordiazepam. The main parameters measured and evaluated were diazepam and nordiazepam pharmacokinetics at steady state (days 8, 15 and 36). These were areas under the curve in the dose intervals (AUC0-24h), maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax), time to peak concentrations (Tmax), elimination half-life (t1/2), elimination constant (Kel), distribution volume (Vd), total body clearance (ClB) and clearance after oral administration (Cloral). The results demonstrated that plasma diazepam and nordiazepam concentrations had a significant increase after steady states have been reached with the simultaneous administration of 800 mg of cimetidine daily for one week. The simultaneous administration of 800 micrograms of misoprostol did not cause any significant change in diazepam and nordiazepam plasma levels after steady states had been reached. Comparing the pharmacokinetic parameters of Groups A and B as well as within groups on days 8, 15 and 36, a significant increase in plasma diazepam and nordiazepam levels was detected. This was due to a cimetidine-induced impairment in microsomal oxidation of diazepam and nordiazepam, which caused a decrease in total metabolic clearance and increased mean steady state plasma concentrations. A more prolonged half-life was observed for both groups taking cimetidine as well as an increase of mean maximum plasma concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1720,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0027202787,0

18162019,"Quality of treatment and disability compensation in depression: comparison of 2 nationally representative samples with a 10-year interval in Finland. OBJECTIVE Depressive disorders cause substantial work impairment that can lead to disability compensation. The authors compared treatment received for depression preceding disability pension between 2 nationally representative samples with a 10-year interval. METHOD The medical statements for 2 random samples drawn from the Finnish national disability pension registers, representing populations granted a disability pension for DSM-III-R major depression during a 12-month period from October 1993 through September 1994 (N = 277) and for ICD-10 depressive disorders (F32-F33) from October 2003 through September 2004 (N = 265) were examined. The proportions of persons receiving weekly psychotherapy, antidepressants, adequate antidepressant dosage, sequential antidepressant trials, lithium augmentation, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) were compared. RESULTS No significant differences emerged between the 2 samples, except for the adequacy of antidepressant dosage. Few subjects in either of the samples (8.7% for 1993-1994 vs. 10.6% for 2003-2004, p = .45) had received weekly psychotherapy. Most had received antidepressants (87.4% vs. 85.6%, p = .55) with increasingly adequate dosage (75.6% vs. 85.0%, p = .02), but only a minority had received sequential antidepressant trials (39.5% vs. 44.5%, p = .24). Lithium augmentation and ECT were rare (1.1% vs. 1.5%, p = .66 and 4.0% vs. 1.5%, p = .08, respectively). Even in 2003-2004, over half of the subjects were granted a disability pension without sequential antidepressant trials. CONCLUSION This nationally representative study indicates that, despite an increased antidepressant use and improved practice guidelines for depression, a considerable proportion of the people granted long-term compensation for depression seem to be suboptimally treated. Given the enormous costs of the disability, attention to the quality of treatment provided for depression is warranted before long-term disability compensations are granted.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1726,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0022650503,0

18183453,"Composition of the phyllospheric microbial populations on vegetable plants with different glucosinolate and carotenoid compositions. The plant phyllosphere is intensely colonized by a complex and highly diverse microbial population and shows pronounced plant-species-specific differences. The mechanisms and influencing factors determining whether and in which density microorganisms colonize plant phyllosphere tissues are not yet fully understood. One of the key influencing factors is thought to be phytochemical concentration and composition. Therefore, correlations between various concentrations of individual glucosinolates and carotenoids in four different plant species-Brassica juncea, Brassica campestris, Cichorium endivia, and Spinacea oleracea-and the phyllospheric bacterial population size associated with the aerial parts of the same plants were analyzed. The concentration of various individual glucosinolates and carotenoids were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. The phyllospheric bacterial population size including both nonculturable and culturable organisms was assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the physiological profile of the culturable microbial community was analyzed using the Biolog system. Results show significant differences between plant species in both concentration and composition of secondary metabolites, bacterial population size, and microbial community composition in three consecutively performed experiments. An interesting and underlying trend was that bacterial density was positively correlated to concentrations of beta-carotene in the plant phyllosphere of the four plant species examined. Likewise, the alkenyl glucosinolates, 2-propenyl, 3-butenyl, and 4-pentenyl, concentrations were positively correlated to the bacterial population density, whereas the aromatic glucosinolate 2-phenylethyl showed a negative correlation to the phyllospheric bacterial population size.

18184806,"Structural basis for specific lipid recognition by CERT responsible for nonvesicular trafficking of ceramide. In mammalian cells, ceramide is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and transferred to the Golgi apparatus for conversion to sphingomyelin. Ceramide transport occurs in a nonvesicular manner and is mediated by CERT, a cytosolic 68-kDa protein with a C-terminal steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain. The CERT START domain efficiently transfers natural D-erythro-C16-ceramide, but not lipids with longer (C20) amide-acyl chains. The molecular mechanisms of ceramide specificity, both stereo-specific recognition and length limit, are not well understood. Here we report the crystal structures of the CERT START domain in its apo-form and in complex with ceramides having different acyl chain lengths. In these complex structures, one ceramide molecule is buried in a long amphiphilic cavity. At the far end of the cavity, the amide and hydroxyl groups of ceramide form a hydrogen bond network with specific amino acid residues that play key roles in stereo-specific ceramide recognition. At the head of the ceramide molecule, there is no extra space to accommodate additional bulky groups. The two aliphatic chains of ceramide are surrounded by the hydrophobic wall of the cavity, whose size and shape dictate the length limit for cognate ceramides. Furthermore, local high-crystallographic B-factors suggest that the alpha-3 and the Omega1 loop might work as a gate to incorporate the ceramide into the cavity. Thus, the structures demonstrate the structural basis for the mechanism by which CERT can distinguish ceramide from other lipid types yet still recognize multiple species of ceramides.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1739,pos_MEDLINE,0.9971827,1

18298090,"Identification and structural characterization of an unusual RING-like sequence within an extracellular biomineralization protein, AP7. The RING or Really Interesting New Gene represents a family of eukaryotic sequences that bind Zn (II) ions and participate in intracellular processes involving protein-protein interaction. Although found in over 400 different proteins, very little is known regarding the structure-function properties of these domains because of the aggregation problems associated with RING sequences. To augment this data set, we report an unusual 36 AA C-terminal sequence of an extracellular matrix mollusk shell protein, AP7, that exhibits partial homology to the RING family. This Cys, His-containing sequence, termed AP7C, binds Zn (II) and other multivalent ions, but does not utilize a tetracoordinate complexation scheme for binding such as that found in Zn (II) finger polypeptides. Moreover, unlike Zn (II) finger and RING domains, this 36 AA can fold into a relatively stable structure in the absence of Zn (II). This folded structure consists of three short helical segments (A, B, and C), with segments A and B separated by a 4 AA type I beta-turn region and segments B and C separated by a 7 AA loop-like region. Interestingly, the putative RING-like region, -RRPFHECALCYSI-, experiences slow conformational exchange between two structural states in solution, most likely in response to imido ring interconversion at P8 and P21. Poisson-Boltzmann solvation calculations reveal that the AP7C molecular surface possesses a cationic region near its N-terminus, which lies adjacent to the 30 AA mineral modification domain in the AP7 protein. Given that the AP7C sequence does not influence mineralization, it is probable that this cationic pseudo-RING region is utilized by the AP7 protein for other tasks such as protein-protein interaction within the mollusk shell matrix.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1783,pos_MEDLINE,0.9973374,1

The oligomeric state and the hydrodynamic properties of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) phosphoprotein (P), a known cofactor of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), and a trypsin-resistant fragment (X) that includes its oligomerization domain were analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium and velocity using analytical ultracentrifugation. The results obtained demonstrate that both P and fragment X are homotetrameric with elongated shapes, consistent with electron micrographs of the purified P protein in which thin rod-like molecules of approximately 12.5 +/- 1.0 nm in length were observed. A new chymotrypsin resistant fragment (Y*) included in fragment X has been identified and purified by gel filtration chromatography. Fragment Y* may represent a minimal version of the P oligomerization domain. Thermal denaturation curves based on circular dichroism data of P protein showed a complex behavior. In contrast, melting data generated for fragments X and particularly fragment Y* showed more homogeneous transitions indicative of simpler structures. A three-dimensional model of X and Y* fragments was built based on the atomic structure of the P oligomerization domain of the related Sendai virus, which is in good agreement with the experimental data.

The tumor suppressor CYLD antagonizes NF-kappaB and JNK signaling by disassembly of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains synthesized in response to cytokine stimulation. Here we describe the crystal structure of the CYLD USP domain, revealing a distinctive architecture that provides molecular insights into its specificity toward Lys63-linked polyubiquitin. We identify regions of the USP domain responsible for this specificity and demonstrate endodeubiquitinase activity toward such chains. Pathogenic truncations of the CYLD C terminus, associated with the hypertrophic skin tumor cylindromatosis, disrupt the USP domain, accounting for loss of CYLD catalytic activity. A small zinc-binding B box domain, similar in structure to other crossbrace Zn-binding folds--including the RING domain found in E3 ubiquitin ligases--is inserted within the globular core of the USP domain.

These activities are presumably associated with Nogo splice isoforms expressed on the cell surface and function largely in trans, exerting an influence as an intercellular membrane-bound ligand. Nogo, and other reticulon paralogues and orthologues, are however mainly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and are likely to have cell autonomous functions that are not yet clear.

The experimental objective was to determine the effects of feeding prepubertal dairy heifers a high-energy diet for 3, 6, or 12 wk on mammary growth and composition. Holstein heifers (age = 11 wk; body weight = 107 +/- 1 kg) were assigned to 1 of 4 treatments (n = 16/ treatment). The treatment period lasted 12 wk and treatments were H0 (low-energy diet fed for 12 wk, with no weeks on the high-energy diet); H3 (low-energy diet fed for 9 wk, followed by the high-energy diet for 3 wk); H6 (low-energy diet fed for 6 wk, followed by the high-energy diet for 6 wk); and H12 (high-energy diet for all 12 wk). The low- and high-energy diets were formulated to achieve 0.6 and 1.2 kg of average daily gain, respectively. Heifers were slaughtered at 23 wk of age and mammary tissue was collected. A longer duration of feeding the high-energy diet increased total mass of the mammary gland, extraparenchymal fat, and intraparenchymal fat, but did not alter the mass of fat-free parenchymal tissue. When adjusted for carcass weight to reflect differences in physical maturity, the mass of fat-free parenchymal tissue decreased in a linear fashion with a longer duration on the high-energy diet. Total masses of mammary parenchymal DNA and RNA were not different. However, after adjustment for carcass weight, the masses of DNA and RNA decreased as heifers were fed the high-energy diet for a longer duration. The percentages of epithelium, stroma, and lumen, the number of epithelial structures, and the developmental scores of mammary parenchymal tissue were not different among treatments. However, the percentage of proliferating epithelial cells in the terminal ductal units, as indicated by Ki-67 labeling, decreased as heifers were fed the high-energy diet for a longer duration. We concluded that feeding prepubertal heifers a high-energy diet for a longer duration resulted in a linear decrease in both the percentage of mammary epithelial cells that were proliferating and in the mass of fat-free mammary parenchyma per unit of carcass. High-energy feeding hastens puberty and, in this study, decreased mammary epithelial cell proliferation in areas of active ductal expansion. These data are consistent with the idea that feeding heifers a high-energy diet will reduce mammary parenchymal mass at puberty.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1817,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0029810332,0

The CASK CaM-kinase domain is presumed to be a catalytically inactive pseudokinase because it lacks the canonical DFG motif required for Mg2+ binding that is thought to be indispensable for kinase activity. Here we show, however, that CASK functions as an active protein kinase even without Mg2+ binding. High-resolution crystal structures reveal that the CASK CaM-kinase domain adopts a constitutively active conformation that binds ATP and catalyzes phosphotransfer without Mg2+. The CASK CaM-kinase domain phosphorylates itself and at least one physiological interactor, the synaptic protein neurexin-1, to which CASK is recruited via its PDZ domain. Thus, our data indicate that CASK combines the scaffolding activity of MAGUKs with an unusual kinase activity that phosphorylates substrates recuited by the scaffolding activity.

BACKGROUND In response to the requirements of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD), a national implementation group was formed to liaise with local implementation groups at nine different pilot sites. As part of this process, a pilot EWTD compliant rota was run for six weeks amongst general surgical SHOs in University Hospital Galway. METHODS A rota was devised for nine general surgical SHOs, the aim being to achieve EWTD compliance. SHOs were asked to complete questionnaires to assess the effectiveness of the pilot. RESULT During the pilot SHOs were rostered for an average of 53.6 hours. Actual hours worked were 58.1 hours. Fifty-two point five per cent of working weeks were non-compliant with the provisions of the EWTD. Seventy per cent of the time SHOs felt that continuity of care was not achieved. Eighty-one per cent felt that patient care deteriorated during the pilot. SHOs spent an average of 2.5 days per week engaged in sessional commitments with their consultant. Fifty percent of SHOs missed elective operating sessions or outpatient clinics. SHOs attended an average of 1.3 emergency operations per week (range 0-8) and 5.5 elective procedures per week (range 0-12). All SHOs reported a deterioration in quantity or quality of training.

18502763,"The type III secretion chaperone SycE promotes a localized disorder-to-order transition in the natively unfolded effector YopE. Many virulence-related, bacterial effector proteins are translocated directly into the cytosol of host cells by the type III secretion (TTS) system. Translocation of most TTS effectors requires binding by specific chaperones in the bacterial cytosol, although how chaperones promote translocation is unclear. To provide insight into the action of such chaperones, we studied the consequences of binding by the Yersinia chaperone SycE to the effector YopE by NMR. These studies examined the intact form of the effector, whereas prior studies have been limited to well ordered fragments. We found that YopE had the characteristics of a natively unfolded protein, with its N-terminal 100 residues, including its chaperone-binding (Cb) region, flexible and disordered in the absence of SycE. SycE binding caused a pronounced disorder-to-order transition in the Cb region of YopE. The effect of SycE was strictly localized to the Cb region, with other portions of YopE being unperturbed. These results provide stringent limits on models of chaperone action and are consistent with the chaperone promoting formation of a three-dimensional targeting signal in the Cb region of the effector.

We report the 2.6 A crystal structure of yeast poly(A) polymerase in complex with a peptide containing residues 80-105 of Fip1. The Fip1 peptide binds to the outside surface of the C-terminal domain of the polymerase. On the basis of this structure, we designed a mutant of the polymerase (V498Y, C485R) that is lethal to yeast. The mutant is unable to bind Fip1 but retains full polymerase activity. Fip1 is found in all eukaryotes and serves to connect poly(A) polymerase to pre-mRNA processing complexes in yeast, plants, and mammals. However, the Fip1 sequence is highly divergent, and residues on both Pap1 and Fip1 at the observed interaction surface are poorly conserved. Herein we demonstrate using analytical ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism, proteolytic studies, and other techniques that, in the absence of Pap1, Fip1 is largely, if not completely, unfolded.

The mutation of this phosphorylation site impairs cell adhesion, actin reorganization, and cell spreading. Thr758 is contained in a Thr triplet of beta2 that also mediates binding to filamin. Here, we investigated the binding of filamin, talin, and 14-3-3 proteins to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated beta2 integrins by biochemical methods and x-ray crystallography. 14-3-3 proteins bound only to the phosphorylated integrin cytoplasmic peptide, with a high affinity (K(d), 261 nM), whereas filamin bound only the unphosphorylated integrin cytoplasmic peptide (K(d), 0.5 mM). Phosphorylation did not regulate talin binding to beta2 directly, but 14-3-3 was able to outcompete talin for the binding to phosphorylated beta2 integrin. X-ray crystallographic data clearly explained how phosphorylation eliminated filamin binding and induced 14-3-3 protein binding. Filamin knockdown in T cells led to an increase in stimulated cell adhesion to ICAM-1-coated surfaces. Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of beta2 integrins on Thr758 acts as a molecular switch to inhibit filamin binding and allow 14-3-3 protein binding to the integrin cytoplasmic domain, thereby modulating T-cell adhesion.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1864,pos_MEDLINE,0.99719906,1
18561946,"Solution structure of the c-terminal dimerization domain of SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein solved by the SAIL-NMR method. INTRODUCTION. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently emergent disease caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (CoV). , The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) packages the viral genomic RNA into a ribonucleoprotein complex and is crucial for the assembly of infectious virus particles. Based on comparative NMR studies of SARS-CoV NP deletion constructs, the protein contains two structural domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD; containing residues 45–181) and the C-terminal domain (CTD; containing residues 248–365), flanked by the long, disordered N- and C-termini and the linker sequence (Fig. 1a). The NTD reportedly acts as a putative RNA-binding domain, and the CTD functions as a dimerization domain. , Recently, the CTD has also been shown to bind nucleic acids with high affinity. Structural investigations of the isolated SARS-CoV NP CTD have been performed by NMR and X-ray crystallography. In a previous NMR study, the topological structure of the isolated SARS-CoV NP CTD as a homodimer was elucidated based on limited intersubunit and intrasubunit nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs). This topology was confirmed by the subsequently reported crystal structures of the SARS-CoV NP CTD and of a shorter construct spanning residues 270–370. , The crystal structure of the CTD revealed that residues 248–280 form a positively charged patch, which acts as a putative oligonucleotide-binding region. The patch also participates in intermolecular and intramolecular interactions within the crystal, resulting in the formation of an octameric asymmetric unit. However, previous biochemical and biophysical studies have shown that the CTD exists solely as a dimer in solution. These findings motivated us to investigate the nature of the CTD in solution. Initial attempts at the complete structure elucidation of the SARS-CoV NP CTD through NMR were impeded by its short T 2 relaxation times and significant peak overlaps. Recently, we have developed the stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL) method, which utilizes proteins exclusively composed of stereo- and regio-specifically labeled amino acids. Compared to conventional uniform 13C,15N isotopic labeling, the quality of the spectra of the SAIL sample was sufficiently improved, so that a high-resolution solution structure determination could be performed. The sharpened resonance lines and reduced peak overlap with the SAIL method are due to the selective deuteration of many nonlabile protons. The remaining protons with known stereo-specific assignments provide plentiful information about the structure of the protein. In this study, we performed an NMR study of the SARS-CoV NP CTD with the help of the SAIL method. Compared to the protein uniformly labeled with 13C and 15N, the SAIL sample significantly improved the quality of the NMR spectra, to the extent that a high-resolution structure determination could be performed. The tertiary structure obtained by NMR is almost identical with that of the crystal structure, except for a disordered putative RNA-binding domain at the N-terminus. We further applied NMR, mutation analyses, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to pinpoint the nucleic-acid-binding site. The active site thus identified agrees well with the helical ribonucleoprotein model suggested by the crystal structure. RESULTS. PREPARATION OF THE SAIL SAMPLE OF THE SARS-COV NP CTD. The preparation of proteins composed of SAIL amino acids requires cell-free expression to efficiently incorporate the SAIL amino acids into the protein without them being affected by metabolic scrambling in living cells. The expression of the SARS-CoV NP CTD was initially examined in a small-scale reaction (Fig. 1b). Subsequently, the 1H–15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) of the 15N-labeled SARS-CoV NP CTD produced by cell-free expression was compared with that produced by in vivo expression. These spectra were identical, thus confirming that the structures of the proteins produced by cell-free and in vivo expressions are identical (data not shown). The final sample of the SAIL SARS-CoV NP CTD was produced by using the Escherichia coli cell-free protein synthesis system, with optimizations for the production of labeled NMR samples. THE SAIL METHOD IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF THE NMR SPECTRUM. The 1H–13C constant time (CT) HSQC spectra of an aliphatic region were compared between uniformly labeled (UL) and SAIL samples under the same conditions. In the case of the UL sample, the signals were prone to overlap between diastereotopic pairs, and some signals were severely broadened beyond detection in the methylene region (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the corresponding spectrum from the SAIL sample had much better quality than that from the UL sample (Fig. 2b). The signal/noise ratios for the SAIL sample were several times higher than those for the corresponding UL sample, consistent with previous results for calmodulin- and maltodextrin-binding proteins (Fig. 2c). For the SARS-CoV NP CTD, the number of peaks to be observed theoretically in the 1H–13C CT HSQC spectra, including methyl, methylene, and methane protons, decreased from 517 for the UL sample to 343 for the SAIL sample, greatly simplifying the analytical process. For the aromatic region, improvement due to the use of the SAIL method was even more striking. The aromatic rings of UL Phe and Tyr contain four and five 13C–1H pairs, respectively (Fig. 3a). In the case of SAIL, the six-membered aromatic rings are labeled by alternating 13C–1H and 12C–2H moieties (13C at the ε and γ positions; 12C at the δ and ζ positions) (Fig. 3b). In the UL sample, signals for the 1H–13C moieties at the δ, ε, and ζ positions of Phe, and at the δ position of Tyr, are overlapped around 131 ppm in the carbon dimension, thus resulting in severe spectral crowding (Fig. 3c). In contrast, the corresponding region for the SAIL sample was much simpler due to the presence of signals exclusively from the 1H–13C moieties at the ε",PMC,pos,1,pos,1867,pos_PMC,0.99772614,1

The positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) (CDK9/cyclin T (CycT)) promotes mRNA transcriptional elongation through phosphorylation of elongation repressors and RNA polymerase II. To understand the regulation of a transcriptional CDK by its cognate cyclin, we have determined the structures of the CDK9/CycT1 and free cyclin T2. There are distinct differences between CDK9/CycT1 and the cell cycle CDK CDK2/CycA manifested by a relative rotation of 26 degrees of CycT1 with respect to the CDK, showing for the first time plasticity in CDK cyclin interactions. The CDK9/CycT1 interface is relatively sparse but retains some core CDK-cyclin interactions. The CycT1 C-terminal helix shows flexibility that may be important for the interaction of this region with HIV TAT and HEXIM. Flavopiridol, an anticancer drug in phase II clinical trials, binds to the ATP site of CDK9 inducing unanticipated structural changes that bury the inhibitor. CDK9 activity and recognition of regulatory proteins are governed by autophosphorylation.

18571199,"Mechanism-based inhibitors of cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase attack FAD cofactor. Cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases (CKOs) mediate catabolic regulation of cytokinin levels in plants. Several substrate analogs containing an unsaturated side chain were studied for their possible inhibitory effect on maize CKO (ZmCKO1) by use of various bioanalytical methods. Two allenic derivatives, N(6)-(buta-2,3-dienyl)adenine (HA-8) and N(6)-(penta-2,3-dienyl)adenine (HA-1), were identified as strong mechanism-based inhibitors of the enzyme. Despite exhaustive dialysis, the enzyme remained inhibited. Conversely, substrate analogs with a triple bond in the side chain were much weaker inactivators. The crystal structures of recombinant ZmCKO1 complexed with HA-1 or HA-8 were solved to 1.95 A resolution. Together with Raman spectra of the inactivated enzyme, it was revealed that reactive imine intermediates generated by oxidation of the allenic inhibitors covalently bind to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor. The binding occurs at the C4a atom of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, the planarity of which is consequently disrupted. All the compounds under study were also analyzed for binding to the Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors AHK3 and AHK4 in a bacterial receptor assay and for cytokinin activity in the Amaranthus bioassay. HA-1 and HA-8 were found to be good receptor ligands with a significant cytokinin activity. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inactivate CKO in the desired time intervals or developmental stages, they both represent attractive compounds for physiological studies, as the inhibition mechanism of HA-1 and HA-8 is mainly FAD dependent.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1871,pos_MEDLINE,0.9948704,1
18571423,"Structural basis for the recognition of histone H4 by the histone-chaperone RbAp46. SUMMARY. RbAp46 and RbAp48 (pRB-associated proteins p46 and p48, also known as RBBP7 and RBBP4, respectively) are highly homologous histone chaperones that play key roles in establishing and maintaining chromatin structure. We report here the crystal structure of human RbAp46 bound to histone H4. RbAp46 folds into a seven-bladed β propeller structure and binds histone H4 in a groove formed between an N-terminal α helix and an extended loop inserted into blade six. Surprisingly, histone H4 adopts a different conformation when interacting with RbAp46 than it does in either the nucleosome or in the complex with ASF1, another histone chaperone. Our structural and biochemical results suggest that when a histone H3/H4 dimer (or tetramer) binds to RbAp46 or RbAp48, helix 1 of histone H4 unfolds to interact with the histone chaperone. We discuss the implications of our findings for the assembly and function of RbAp46 and RbAp48 complexes. INTRODUCTION. The nucleosome is the fundamental structural unit of chromatin in all eukaryotic cells. The core of the nucleosome is an octameric histone complex, comprising two H3/H4 heterodimers that associate to form a tetramer and that then bind two H2A/H2B dimers. Nucleosomes convey chemically encoded information either through covalent modifications or the incorporation of variant histone isoforms. They are made during replication, when histone octamers must be assembled and incorporated into DNA de novo. Histone chaperones are essential components of the machinery that aides the assembly of nucleosomes during replication and recruits the enzymes needed to mark the histones covalently. In addition, histone chaperones are also found in many chromatin-associated complexes, where they often work in conjunction with enzymes that remodel chromatin structure by repositioning nucleosome cores in an ATP-dependent manner. RbAp46 and RbAp48 are highly homologous histone chaperones that play key roles in protein complexes that function to establish and maintain chromatin structure. They are integral subunits of protein complexes that either add or remove acetyl moieties from the ɛ-amino groups of lysine residues on the flexible N-terminal tail of histone H4, and they are also key components of histone methylases. RbAp46 binds to and enhances the activity of the type B histone acetyltransferase HAT1, an enzyme that acetylates histone H4 specifically at lysine residues 5 and 12 prior to their incorporation into nucleosomes during replication (Parthun et al., 1996; Verreault et al., 1998). This specific pattern of acetylation of newly synthesized histone H4 is conserved from yeast to humans (Benson et al., 2006). The importance of this modification is indicated by the crucial role HAT1 plays in the cellular resistance to genotoxic agents (Barman et al., 2006; Benson et al., 2007). RbAp48, on the other hand, is an evolutionarily conserved subunit of the chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) complex, where it associates with two other subunits, known as p150 and p60 in human cells. Like RbAp46, RbAp48 also contributes to a large number of other protein complexes within the cell, and they are sometimes both found in the same protein complex. Intriguingly, although RbAp46 and RbAp48 are 90% identical at the amino acid sequence level, in both human and yeast cells RbAp46 is found exclusively in complexes with HAT1, whereas RbAp48 is instead found in the CAF-1 complex (Parthun et al., 1996; Kaufman et al., 1997; Verreault et al., 1996, 1998). Both RbAp46 and RbAp48 are found in the catalytic cores of histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes that promote transcriptional repression of target genes, including those repressed by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Korenjak et al., 2004; Nicolas et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 1999). The other components of the core HDAC complex are HDAC1 and HDAC2 (Zhang et al., 1999). This core HDAC complex associates with other proteins in both the Sin3A HDAC complex (Vermaak et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 1998) and the nucleosome remodeling and HDAC complex, NuRD (Wade et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 1999). In addition, both RbAp46 and RbAp48 are found as components of two distinct EZH2/EED complexes that methylate either histone H3 lysine 27 or histone H1 lysine 26 to promote epigenetic silencing of regulatory genes during development (Kuzmichev et al., 2004). Moreover, both proteins are also components of the ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF), which has been implicated in transcriptional regulation (Barak et al., 2003; Martinez-Balbas et al., 1998). In Drosophila, p55 is the sole ortholog of RbAp46/48 and, in addition to being a subunit of CAF-1, p55 also forms a complex with histone H4 and an essential centromeric variant of histone H3, known as CID in Drosophila or CENP-A in mammals (Furuyama et al., 2006). Finally, compelling evidence indicates that orthologs of p55 in S. pombe (Mis16) and human cells (RbAp48) are required for deposition and/or retention of CENP-A into centromeric chromatin (Hayashi et al., 2004). This is puzzling because CAF-1 deposits histone H3/H4 throughout the genome, whereas the p55/CENP-A/H4 complex is likely specific for centromeres. We report here the crystal structure of human RbAp46 bound to histone H4. Our results suggest that when the histone H3/H4 dimer (or tetramer) binds RbAp46, helix 1 of histone H4 unfolds and adopts a different conformation than is observed in either the nucleosome or in the complex with ASF1, another histone chaperone. We discuss the implications of our findings for the orchestrated assembly and function of RbAp46 and RbAp48 complexes. RESULTS. OVERALL STRUCTURE. Earlier studies have shown that residues 15–41 of histone H4 are sufficient for recognition by either RbAp46 or RbAp48 (Verreault et al., 1998).

18590740,"The SOCS box domain of SOCS3: structure and interaction with the elonginBC-cullin5 ubiquitin ligase. Suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) is responsible for regulating the cellular response to a variety of cytokines, including interleukin 6 and leukaemia inhibitory factor. Identification of the SOCS box domain led to the hypothesis that SOCS3 can associate with functional E3 ubiquitin ligases and thereby induce the degradation of bound signalling proteins. This model relies upon an interaction between the SOCS box, elonginBC and a cullin protein that forms the E3 ligase scaffold. We have investigated this interaction in vitro using purified components and show that SOCS3 binds to elonginBC and cullin5 with high affinity. The SOCS3-elonginBC interaction was further characterised by determining the solution structure of the SOCS box-elonginBC ternary complex and by deletion and alanine scanning mutagenesis of the SOCS box. These studies revealed that conformational flexibility is a key feature of the SOCS-elonginBC interaction. In particular, the SOCS box is disordered in isolation and only becomes structured upon elonginBC association. The interaction depends upon the first 12 residues of the SOCS box domain and particularly on a deeply buried, conserved leucine. The SOCS box, when bound to elonginBC, binds tightly to cullin5 with 100 nM affinity. Domains upstream of the SOCS box are not required for elonginBC or cullin5 association, indicating that the SOCS box acts as an independent binding domain capable of recruiting elonginBC and cullin5 to promote E3 ligase formation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1880,pos_MEDLINE,0.9978594,1

Glycosome biogenesis is mediated by proteins called ""peroxins,"" which are considered to be promising drug targets in pathogenic Trypanosomatidae. The first step during protein translocation across the glycosomal membrane of peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1)-harboring proteins is signal recognition by the cytosolic receptor peroxin 5 (PEX5). The C-terminal PTS1 motifs interact with the PTS1 binding domain (P1BD) of PEX5, which is made up of seven tetratricopeptide repeats. Obtaining diffraction-quality crystals of the P1BD of Trypanosoma brucei PEX5 (TbPEX5) required surface entropy reduction mutagenesis. Each of the seven tetratricopeptide repeats appears to have a residue in the alpha(L) conformation in the loop connecting helices A and B. Five crystal structures of the P1BD of TbPEX5 were determined, each in complex with a hepta- or decapeptide corresponding to a natural or nonnatural PTS1 sequence. The PTS1 peptides are bound between the two subdomains of the P1BD. These structures indicate precise recognition of the C-terminal Leu of the PTS1 motif and important interactions between the PTS1 peptide main chain and up to five invariant Asn side chains of PEX5. The TbPEX5 structures reported here reveal a unique hydrophobic pocket in the subdomain interface that might be explored to obtain compounds that prevent relative motions of the subdomains and interfere selectively with PTS1 motif binding or release in trypanosomatids, and would therefore disrupt glycosome biogenesis and prevent parasite growth.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1882,pos_MEDLINE,0.9977743,1

In this study, a recombinant human reelin-N domain has been expressed, purified, and shown to bind heparin. The crystal structure of the reelin-N domain resolved to 2.0 A reveals a variant immunoglobulin-like fold and potential heparin-binding sites. Substantial conformational variations even in secondary structure are observed between the two chemically identical reelin-N domains in one crystallographic asymmetric unit. The variations may result from extensive, highly specific interactions across the interface of the two reelin-N domains. The calculated values of buried surface area and the interface's shape complementarity are consistent with the formation of a weak dimer. The homophilic asymmetric dimer can potentially offer advantages in binding to ligands such as glycosaminoglycans, which may, in turn, bridge the two reelin-N domains and stabilize the dimer.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1883,pos_MEDLINE,0.99762183,1

18630911,"NMR structure of the complex between the Tfb1 subunit of TFIIH and the activation domain of VP16: structural similarities between VP16 and p53. The Herpes Simplex Virion Protein 16 (VP16) activates transcription through a series of protein/protein interactions involving its highly acidic transactivation domain (TAD). The acidic TAD of VP16 (VP16TAD) has been shown to interact with several partner proteins both in vitro and in vivo, and many of these VP16 partners also bind the acidic TAD of the mammalian tumor suppressor protein p53. For example, the TADs of VP16 and p53 (p53TAD) both interact directly with the p62/Tfb1 (human/yeast) subunit of TFIIH, and this interaction correlates with their ability to activate both the initiation and elongation phase of transcription. In this manuscript, we use NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetery (ITC) and site-directed mutagenesis studies to characterize the interaction between the VP16TAD and Tfb1. We identify a region within the carboxyl-terminal subdomain of the VP16TAD (VP16C) that has sequence similarity with p53TAD2 and binds Tfb1 with nanomolar affinity. We determine an NMR structure of a Tfb1/VP16C complex, which represents the first high-resolution structure of the VP16TAD in complex with a target protein. The structure demonstrates that like p53TAD2, VP16C forms a 9-residue alpha-helix in complex with Tfb1. Comparison of the VP16/Tfb1and p53/Tfb1 structures clearly demonstrates how the viral activator VP16C and p53TAD2 shares numerous aspects of binding to Tfb1. Despite the similarities, important differences are observed between the p53TAD2/Tfb1 and VP16C/Tfb1 complexes, and these differences demonstrate how selected activators such as p53 depend on phosphorylation events to selectively regulate transcription.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1888,pos_MEDLINE,0.99794525,1

Molecular dynamics simulations of this 34-amino acid peptide revealed electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with the detergent molecules that induce helical structure formation from residues 8-10 toward the C-terminus. The orientation in the micelles was experimentally confirmed by backbone amide proton exchange. The simulation and the experiment indicated that the N-terminal region is disordered, and the peptide curves to adopted the micelle shape.

Isoform A, found in fungi and plants, comprises approximately 530 residues, whereas isoform G, found only in bacteria, is larger by approximately 200 residues. Crystal structures of malate synthase isoform G from Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were previously determined at moderate resolution.

In addition, a crystal structure for Bacillus anthracis MSA at 1.70 A resolution is reported. The increase in size between isoforms A and G can be attributed primarily to an inserted alpha/beta domain that may have regulatory function. Upon binding of inhibitor or substrate, several active site loops in MSA undergo large conformational changes.

Most of the available antidepressants, with different pharmacological profiles, such as inhibitors of serotonin reuptake (SSRIs) or norepinephrine reuptake (NRIs) or both (SNRIs), have limitations leading some patients to drop out of treatment. Another direction of research has therefore been undertaken, based initially on the fact that affective disorders are most often characterized by abnormal patterns of circadian rhythms. This consideration has led to the synthesis of agomelatine, a novel antidepressant combining melatonergic MT(1) and MT(2) agonism and serotonergic 5-HT(2C) antagonism. The antidepressant effects of agomelatine have been investigated in different animal models, including chronic mild stress, forced swimming, learned helplessness and psychosocial stress.

18762196,"Solution structure of a cyanobacterial phytochrome GAF domain in the red-light-absorbing ground state. SUMMARY. The unique photochromic absorption behavior of phytochromes (Phys) depends on numerous reversible interactions between the bilin chromophore and the associated polypeptide. To help define these dynamic interactions, we determined by NMR spectroscopy the first solution structure of the chromophore-binding cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenylcyclase/FhlA (GAF) domain from a cyanobacterial Phy assembled with phycocyanobilin (PCB). The three dimensional NMR structure of Synechococcus OS-B′ Cph1 in its red light-absorbing Pr state revealed that PCB is bound to Cys-138 of the GAF domain via the A-ring ethylidene side chain and is buried within the GAF domain in a ZZZsyn,syn,anti configuration. The D ring of the chromophore sits within a hydrophobic pocket and is tilted approximately 80° relative to the B/C rings by contacts with Lys-52 and His-169. The solution structure revealed remarkable flexibility for PCB and several adjacent amino acids, indicating that the Pr chromophore has more freedom in the binding pocket than anticipated. The propionic acid side chains of rings B and C and Arg-101 and Arg-133 nearby are especially mobile and can assume several distinct and energetically favorable conformations. Mutagenic studies on these arginines, which are conserved within the Phy superfamily, revealed that they have opposing roles with Arg-101 and Arg-133 helping stabilize and destabilize Pfr, respectively. Given the fact that the Synechococcus OS-B′ GAF domain can by itself complete the Pr→Pfr photocycle, it should now be possible to determine the solution structure of the far-red light-absorbing Pfr chromophore and surrounding pocket using this Pr structure as a framework. INTRODUCTION. Microorganisms and plants have evolved a collection of photoreceptors that help them adapt both physiologically and developmentally to the ambient light environment. One of the most influential is the phytochrome (Phy) superfamily, a large collection of diverse photoreceptors that use bilins (or linear tetrapyrroles) as the chromophore.1,2,3 Through unique interactions between the bilin and its binding pocket, Phys can exist in two stable photointerconvertible states, a red light (R)-absorbing Pr form that is typically the ground state, and a far-red light (FR)-absorbing Pfr form that is often biologically active. Through this photochromicity, Phys act as reversible switches in various photosensory cascades. Processes regulated by these switches include seed germination, chloroplast development, shade avoidance and flowering time in plants 3, and phototaxis and photosynthetic potential in bacteria.1. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that individual Phys are composed of a series of defined structural domains that are combinatorially arranged to impart distinct attributes to the photoreceptors.1,2,4 The photosensing portion typically includes an N-terminal Per/Arndt/Sim (PAS) domain immediately followed by a cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenylcyclase/FhlA (GAF) domain. The GAF domain provides the bilin lyase activity, and together with the bound chromophore, generates most of the unique R/FR photochromic absorption properties of Phys. For bacterial (BphPs) and fungal Phys, biliverdin IXα (BV) is the chromophore,1 which is attached via a conserved cysteine upstream of the PAS domain. For cyanobacterial (Cph) and plant Phys, phycocyanobilin (PCB) and phytochromobilin are the chromophores, respectively, which are bound via a conserved cysteine in the GAF domain.2 This switch in bilin and attachment site appears to have been advantageous to photosynthetic organisms by better enabling their Phys to detect shading by competitors.5 Downstream of the GAF domain is a structurally related phytochrome (PHY) domain that helps complete the Pr→Pfr photocycle and stabilizes the Pfr form. The C-terminal end of Phys contains one or more motifs that promote signal transmission and dimerization.1,2 The most common output motifs are histidine kinase or related domains that enable Phys to act as photoreversible phosphotransferases. Despite intense effort, the molecular details related to how Phys photointerconvert between Pr and Pfr and how this photochromicity directs signal transmission remain largely unresolved. Important insights were made recently by us 5,6 and others 7 through the x-ray crystallographic analysis of PAS-GAF fragments from two BphPs in the Pr conformation. These static three-dimensional (3D) structures revealed that the BV chromophore is buried deeply within the GAF domain and arranged in a ZZZsyn,syn,anti configuration as Pr. A large hydrophobic cavity surrounds the D pyrrole ring,5 which may facilitate the proposed Z to E isomerization of the C15=C16 methylene bridge and concomitant rotation of the D ring during Pr→Pfr photoconversion.2 The PAS domain does not contact the chromophore directly but instead is connected via a figure-of-eight knot to the bilin and the GAF domain.6 The interface between the bilin and the GAF domain includes a number of amino acids highly conserved within the Phy superfamily, many of which have been shown to be photochemically important. Examples include an aspartic acid within an invariant DIP motif that participates in a proton exchange cycle of the bilin during photoconversion, a histidine that torsionally strains the D ring of the Pr chromophore, and a number of amino acids that help the bilin dock with its binding pocket.7,8,9,10,11. Full mechanistic appreciation of Phys still requires one or more 3D structures of the Pfr state to elucidate how the chromophore and protein move during phototransformation. In addition, structures of Cphs and/or plant Phys are needed to confirm expectations that they adopt similar chromophore conformations despite their use of different bilins conjugated at a different site. X-ray crystallographic approaches to the structural determination of Pfr have been particularly challenging. Two main problems are that most Pfr preparations are substantially contam",PMC,pos,1,pos,1918,pos_PMC,0.9974885,1
18762554,"Consequences of poly-glutamine repeat length for the conformation and folding of the androgen receptor amino-terminal domain. Poly-amino acid repeats, especially long stretches of glutamine (Q), are common features of transcription factors and cell-signalling proteins and are prone to expansion, resulting in neurodegenerative diseases. The amino-terminal domain of the androgen receptor (AR-NTD) has a poly-Q repeat between 9 and 36 residues, which when it expands above 40 residues results in spinal bulbar muscular atrophy. We have used spectroscopy and biochemical analysis to investigate the structural consequences of an expanded repeat (Q45) or removal of the repeat (DeltaQ) on the folding of the AR-NTD. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that in aqueous solution, the AR-NTD has a relatively limited amount of stable secondary structure. Expansion of the poly-Q repeat resulted in a modest increase in alpha-helix structure, while deletion of the repeat resulted in a small loss of alpha-helix structure. These effects were more pronounced in the presence of the structure-promoting solvent trifluoroethanol or the natural osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the microenvironments of four tryptophan residues were also altered after the deletion of the Q stretch. Other structural changes were observed for the AR-NTDQ45 polypeptide after limited proteolysis; in addition, this polypeptide not only showed enhanced binding of the hydrophobic probe 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulphonic acid but was more sensitive to urea-induced unfolding. Taken together, these findings support the view that the presence and length of the poly-Q repeat modulate the folding and structure of the AR-NTD.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1919,pos_MEDLINE,0.9965771,1
18779323,"An unusual intrinsically disordered protein from the model legume Lotus japonicus stabilizes proteins in vitro. Intrinsic structural disorder is a prevalent feature of proteins with chaperone activity. Using a complementary set of techniques, we have structurally characterized LjIDP1 (intrinsically disordered protein 1) from the model legume Lotus japonicus, and our results provide the first structural characterization of a member of the Lea5 protein family (PF03242). Contrary to in silico predictions, we show that LjIDP1 is intrinsically disordered and probably exists as an ensemble of conformations with limited residual beta-sheet, turn/loop, and polyproline II secondary structure. Furthermore, we show that LjIDP1 has an inherent propensity to undergo a large conformational shift, adopting a largely alpha-helical structure when it is dehydrated and in the presence of different detergents and alcohols. This is consistent with an overrepresentation of order-promoting residues in LjIDP1 compared with the average of intrinsically disordered proteins. In line with functioning as a chaperone, we show that LjIDP1 effectively prevents inactivation of two model enzymes under conditions that promote protein misfolding and aggregation. The LjIdp1 gene is expressed in all L. japonicus tissues tested. A higher expression level was found in the root tip proximal zone, in roots inoculated with compatible endosymbiotic M. loti, and in functional nitrogen-fixing root nodules. We suggest that the ability of LjIDP1 to prevent protein misfolding and aggregation may play a significant role in tissues, such as symbiotic root nodules, which are characterized by high metabolic activity.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,1926,pos_MEDLINE,0.9979372,1

18818516,"X-ray structure of the complex of regulatory subunits of human DNA polymerase delta. INTRODUCTION. Efficient replication and repair of genomic DNA is vitally important for the inheritance in humans and for the prevention of genetic disorders and cancer. Pol δ is one of the three major replicases in eukaryotes.1,2 In concert with Pol α, it can synthesize both leading and lagging DNA strands in the SV40 system and in yeast strains with no catalytic subunit of Pol ε.3,4 It belongs to B family DNA polymerases, one of the largest DNA polymerase families, with representatives in many organisms, from prokaryotes, archaea, phages and viruses to multi-cellular eukaryotes.5 The structure of several B family polymerases from these groups, except eukaryotes, has been solved. Classic example is the single-subunit replicase of bacteriophage RB69, in a complex with DNA and a nucleotide.6 Because of homology it is likely that catalytic subunits of eukaryotic polymerases possess similar organization. Structural information from lower organisms can be used to model the effects of amino acid substitutions on functions of eukaryotic B family polymerases.7 However, proper Pol δ function relies on a multi-protein complex of catalytic subunit with tightly associated regulatory subunits, whose structure is unknown. The only information available is a model of yeast Pol ε built on the basis of cryo-electron microscopy.8 It provides the overview of possible DNA polymerase complex architecture with 20 Å resolution but does not reveal the details of interactions between subunits necessary to understand the mechanism of polymerase transactions. The best studied genetically and biochemically are Pol δ’s from yeast: a three-subunit complex from budding yeast S. cerevisiae and a four-subunit complex from fission yeast S. pombe. The largest catalytic subunit contains the polymerase and 3′→5′ exonuclease active sites domains, as well as regions for protein-protein interactions,9 for example a PCNA binding motif.2 The essential second subunit serves as a stabilizer for the catalytic subunit and as a matchmaker with the third subunit. The third subunit plays several important roles. The N-terminal part interacts with the second subunit whereas the C-terminal part contains a conserved PCNA-binding motif and a motif that mediates interaction with Pol α10–12 The gene encoding the third subunit, POL32, is dispensable for growth in budding yeast, suggesting that the two-subunit Pol δ retains its role in bulk replication.2 However, other critical biological processes are severely impaired. Deletion of the POL32 gene renders yeast UV-sensitive and UV-immutable,13–15 suggesting a role of the Pol32 protein in the regulation of error-prone trans-lesion DNA synthesis (TLS).5,16 It was recently found that Pol32 is also required for break-induced recombination (BIR) and for telomerase-independent telomere maintenance.17. Human Pol δ consists of four subunits: p125, p50, p66 and p12. The first three subunits correspond to the three subunits of S. cerevisiae Pol δ. No catalytic activity is associated with the auxiliary subunits, and they are thought to play a regulatory role, stimulate the polymerase activity of p125 by mediating additional interactions with PCNA, and stabilize the entire Pol δ complex.18,19 p50 serves as a scaffold for the assembly of Pol δ by interacting simultaneously with all of the other three subunits.20 In addition, p50 is also involved in the recruitment of several proteins regulating DNA metabolism, including p21,21 PDIP1, PDIP38, PDIP46 and WRN (reviewed in ref. 21). The parts of p50 responsible for interactions with p66, p125 and p12 have not been defined. Using two-hybrid screening, the human p66 has been shown to contain p50- and PCNA-binding domains within the 144 N- and 20 C-terminal amino acids, respectively.22 Interestingly, many essential functions of Pol δ, including the regulation of replication, TLS and BIR, are mediated by the third subunit13,15,17,23,24 and thus apparently depend on the interaction between its second and third subunits. Here we report the crystal structure of the complex between the second p50 subunit and the 144 amino acids N-terminal domain of the third p66 subunit (p66N) of human Pol δ. The structure revealed a formation of a tight complex between these two subunits of Pol δ, confirmed by two-hybrid analysis of interface mutants. The biological significance of p50•p66 interaction has been demonstrated by genetic experiments in yeast. The results have broad implications for understanding the structure, function and evolution of replicative DNA polymerase complexes. RESULTS. OVERALL STRUCTURE OF P50•P66N. The crystal structure of p50•p66N has been determined using the multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) method and refined at 3 Å resolution. Four discrete molecules of p50•p66N without apparent oligomerization were located in an asymmetric unit and each molecule contained all amino acid residues of p66N and p50, except disordered regions in four loops and the C-terminal tail of p50. The structure revealed an extended cashew-shaped molecule with overall dimensions of 100 × 60 × 50 Å3 and three domains: phosphodiesterase-like (PDE) and oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) domains in p50, and a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) domain in p66 (Figs. 1A and B, and 2). The PDE domain is located in the center of the molecule and bound to an OB domain on one side, and a wHTH domain on the other side.

18820236,"Minimal folding pathways for coarse-grained biopolymer fragments. The minimal folding pathway or trajectory for a biopolymer can be defined as the transformation that minimizes the total distance traveled between a folded and an unfolded structure. This involves generalizing the usual Euclidean distance from points to one-dimensional objects such as a polymer. We apply this distance here to find minimal folding pathways for several candidate protein fragments, including the helix, the beta-hairpin, and a nonplanar structure where chain noncrossing is important. Comparing the distances traveled with root mean-squared distance and mean root-squared distance, we show that chain noncrossing can have large effects on the kinetic proximity of apparently similar conformations. Structures that are aligned to the beta-hairpin by minimizing mean root-squared distance, a quantity that closely approximates the true distance for long chains, show globally different orientation than structures aligned by minimizing root mean-squared distance.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,1941,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0025809042,0

A novel norvancomycin-bonded chiral stationary phase (NVC-CSP) was synthesized by using the chiral selector of norvancomycin. The chiral separation of enantiomers of several dansyl-amino acids by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the reversed-phase mode is described. The effects of some parameters, such as organic modifier concentration, column temperature, pH and flow rate of the mobile phase, on the retention and enantioselectivity were investigated. The study showed that ionic, as well as hydrophobic interactions were engaged between the analyte and macrocycle in this chromatographic system. Increasing pH of buffers usually improved the chiral resolution for dansyl-alpha-amino-n-butyric acid (Dns-But), dansyl-methionine (Dns-Met) and dansyl-threonine (Dns-Thr), but not for dansyl-glutamic acid (Dns-Glu) which contains two carboxylic groups in its molecular structure.

19026786,"The Skap-hom dimerization and PH domains comprise a 3'-phosphoinositide-gated molecular switch. SUMMARY. PH domains, by binding to phosphoinositides, often serve as membrane-targeting modules. Using crystallographic, biochemical and cell biological approaches, we have uncovered a mechanism that the integrin-signaling adaptor Skap-hom uses to mediate cytoskeletal interactions. Skap-hom is a homodimer containing an N-terminal four-helix-bundle dimerization domain, against which its two PH domains pack in a conformation incompatible with phosphoinositide binding. The isolated PH domains bind PI[3,4,5]P3, and mutations targeting the dimerization domain or the PH domain’s PI[3,4,5]P3-binding pocket prevent Skap-hom localization to ruffles. Targeting is retained when the PH domain is deleted or by combined mutation of the PI[3,4,5]P3-binding pocket and the PH/dimerization domain interface. Thus, the dimerization and PH domain form a novel PI[3,4,5]P3-responsive molecular switch that controls Skap-hom function. INTRODUCTION. Cells use a variety of modular domains and motifs to target signaling molecules appropriately. One common module, the Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, is found in molecules as diverse as kinases, guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs), and adaptors. Some PH domains, including the PH domains of Btk, Akt and Grp1, exhibit high affinity binding to phosphoinositides. Consequently, the conventional view is that PH domains direct signaling components to sites of phosphoinositide production on various cellular membranes. But a comprehensive survey has shown that most PH/phosphoinositide interactions are relatively weak, implying that PH domains may have additional functions (Lemmon, 2004). Some PH domains do bind specific proteins (Lemmon, 2004), and recently, the SOS1 PH domain was reported to bind phosphatadic acid (Zhao et al., 2007). Yet the biochemical and physiological functions of the majority of PH domains remain unknown. Adaptors function downstream of receptors, including those for growth factors, cytokines, antigens and cell adhesion molecules, and primarily consist of domains that mediate protein/protein and/or protein/membrane interactions (Simeoni et al., 2004). Some adaptors help reorganize the cytoskeleton and/or promote integrin-mediated adhesion upon immunoreceptor activation. In T lymphocytes, these include Adap (adhesion and degranulation promoting adaptor protein, previously known as Fyn-binding protein, Fyb) (da Silva et al., 1997; Griffiths et al., 2001; Peterson et al., 2001) and its binding partner Skap55 (Src-kinase-associated phosphoprotein of 55 kDa) (Wang et al., 2003). Adap55−/− T cells fail to activate the integrin Lfa-1 in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, and have severe functional defects (Griffiths et al., 2001; Peterson et al., 2001). Skap55−/− T cells have a similar phenotype (Wang et al., 2007), suggesting that Skap55 and Adap act together to promote integrin activation. Exactly how this occurs remains unclear. Adap binds Vasp and Wasp, suggesting a role in Arp2/3 recruitment and de novo actin polymerization (Coppolino et al., 2001; Krause et al., 2000). Skap55 has a previously uncharacterized N-terminal region, a central PH domain, a C-terminal SH3 domain that binds Adap, and intervening linkers with tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Given these features, Skap55 might function to target Adap in response to TCR activation, in which case the Skap55−/− phenotype would reflect effective Adap deficiency. Alternatively, because Adap stabilizes Skap55 (Huang et al., 2005), the Adap−/− phenotype could be due to effective Skap55 deficiency. On the other hand, recent data indicate that the Skap55/Adap complex binds Riam1 (Kliche et al., 2006; Menasche et al., 2007), a Rap1 effector that recruits and stimulates the integrin-activating protein Talin (Wegener et al., 2007). Skap55 and Adap alone lack this function, suggesting that a novel Riam1-binding surface is generated or exposed in the Skap55/Adap complex. Adap is expressed broadly in lympho-hematopoietic cells (da Silva et al., 1997), but Skap55 is expressed solely in T lymphocytes (Marie-Cardine et al., 1997). The concerted actions of Skap55 and Adap suggest that another protein(s) substitutes for Skap55 in, for example, myeloid cells. Skap-hom (Skap55 homolog), has the same architecture as Skap55 (Figure 1A), and is expressed widely in lympho-hematopoietic cells (Curtis et al., 2000; Kouroku et al., 1998; Marie-Cardine et al., 1998). Skap-hom also associates via its SH3 domain with Adap, and is implicated in integrin signaling. For example, Skap-hom interacts with actin (Bourette et al., 2005) and, with Adap, undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to plating of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) on fibronectin (Timms et al., 1999). Skap-hom and Adap are substrates for the virulence factor YopH, a tyrosine phosphatase encoded by enteropathogenic Yersinia species and dephosphorylation of Skap-hom appears to interfere with adhesion-dependent events in phagocytosis (Black et al., 2000; Fallman et al., 2002). Finally, Skap-hom−/− B cells show defective adhesion in response to B cell receptor stimulation (Togni et al., 2005). Although Skap proteins couple receptors to cytoskeletal rearrangements, their biochemical properties and mechanism of action remain poorly understood. For example, whether Skap PH domains bind phosphoinositides, and if so which ones, has not been determined. The sequence of the N-terminus of Skap-hom suggests a coiled-coil oligomerization element (Marie-Cardine et al., 1998), but it is unclear whether Skap55 and Skap-hom multimerize in vivo. To provide a foundation for dissecting the function and regulation of SKAP proteins, we undertook a structural and biochemical analysis of Skap-hom. Our results reveal an unusual four-helix-bundle dimerization domain in the Skap-hom N-terminus, and show that the dimerization and PH domains comprise a PI[3,4,5]P3-sensitive conformational switch that regulates its sub-cellular targeting.

Like their counterparts in the vitelline envelope of non-mammalian eggs and many other secreted eukaryotic proteins, zona pellucida subunits polymerize using a 'zona pellucida (ZP) domain' module, whose conserved amino-terminal part (ZP-N) was suggested to constitute a domain of its own.

No evidence could be found to support a role for oxidative protein crosslinking by a free radical mechanism. Crosslinking was not inhibited by blocking protein sulfhydryl groups with iodoacetamide, nor were the protein crosslinks dissociated by boiling with 2% mercaptoethanol prior to SDS-PAGE. The addition of a variety of oxygen free radical quenchers had no effect on the extent of protein crosslinking. In fact, the removal of oxygen from the reaction mixture had no effect on either protein glycation, protein crosslinking or the modification of lysine residues, provided DHA was used as the glycating agent.

Further, the phosphorylation of p38, ERK 1/2 and JNK in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells was suppressed by CA in a concentration-dependent manner. LPS-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also effectively inhibited by CA. These results suggest that CA exerts anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages by inhibition of NF-kappaB activation and MAP kinase phosphorylation.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,2087,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0032858336,0
19369963,"Ascorbic acid inhibits antitumor activity of bortezomib in vivo. Earlier studies have shown that ascorbic acid (vitamin C) inhibits bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity against cancer cells in vitro. However, the clinical significance of vitamin C on bortezomib treatment is unclear. In this study, we examined whether daily oral intake of vitamin C inhibits antimultiple myeloma (MM) activities of bortezomib. Vitamin C, at orally achievable concentrations, inhibited in vitro MM cell cytotoxicity of bortezomib and blocked its inhibitory effect on 20S proteasome activity. Specifically, plasma collected from healthy volunteers taking 1 g/day vitamin C reduced bortezomib-induced MM cell death in vitro. This antagonistic effect of vitamin C against proteasome inhibitors is limited to the boronate class of inhibitors (bortezomib and MG262). In vivo activity of this combination treatment was then evaluated using our xenograft model of human MM in SCID (severe combined immune-deficient) mice. Bortezomib (0.1 mg/kg twice a week for 4 weeks) significantly inhibits in vivo MM cell growth, which was blocked by oral vitamin C (40 mg/kg/day). Therefore, our results for the first time show that vitamin C can significantly reduce the activity of bortezomib treatment in vivo; and importantly, suggest that patients receiving treatment with bortezomib should avoid taking vitamin C dietary supplements.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,2094,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0027576222,0
19386620,"Structural basis for m7G-cap hypermethylation of small nuclear, small nucleolar and telomerase RNA by the dimethyltransferase TGS1. INTRODUCTION. The m7G-cap of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) as well as the telomerase RNA TLC1 is known to be hypermethylated by the Trimethylguanosine Synthase 1 (TGS1) during maturation of the respective ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). Especially the biogenesis of the human uridyl-rich snRNPs U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6, the major components of the spliceosome, is well characterized (1,2). Except for U6snRNP, in vertebrates the biogenesis of UsnRNPs involves a nucleocytoplasmic transport cycle. After transcription by RNA-polymerase II, the snRNAs U1, U2, U4 and U5 acquire an m7G-cap and are subsequently exported to the cytoplasm in a cap dependent manner (3,4). In the cytoplasm seven Sm-proteins (B/B′, D1, D2, D3, E, F and G) are assembled in a doughnut-like structure around the highly conserved Sm-site (5′-PuA(U)nGPu-3′) of the UsnRNA (5–7). The resulting Sm-core UsnRNP was shown to be a prerequisite for m7G-cap hypermethylation (7,8) by a cap dimethyltransferase, catalyzing the addition of two methyl groups to the exocyclic NH2 group of the N7-methylguanine (m7G) (7,9,10). The m3G-cap and the Sm-core serve as bipartite import signal, which mediates the import of the assembled UsnRNP-core into the nucleus (11–17). The import occurs by the concerted action of snurportin1 (SPN1), the survival of motor neuron (SMN)-complex and importinβ (Impβ). SPN1 binds the hypermethylated UsnRNA cap-guanine and the first nucleotide of the RNA in a stacked conformation and bridges the interaction to the import factor Impβ (13,18). After translocation Impβ dissociates from the complex due to the binding of Ran-GTP. A sub-complex containing at least the assembled UsnRNP and SPN1, which is bound to the m3G-cap, remains (19) and its disassembly is not yet understood. The released UsnRNPs individually associate with specific sets of proteins, resulting in the particular, mature UsnRNPs U1, U2, U4 and U5 (20). However, the U6snRNP is generated by a different pathway that does not include such cytoplasmic maturation steps. In contrast to all other UsnRNPs it is transcribed by RNA polymerase III (21–23) and acquires a γ-monomethyl-phosphate-cap. Together with the other UsnRNPs it accumulates subsequent to maturation in nuclear (interchromatin) speckles and in cajal bodies (24,25). The enzyme responsible for hypermethylation of the UsnRNA-m7G-cap in yeast was first identified by Mouaikel and co-workers in 2002 and it was named TGS1 in accordance to its function (26). As a bona fide dimethyltransferase it catalyzes two successive methyl group transfers, each from one S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to the exocyclic nitrogen N2 of the cap-guanine, generating two S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine molecules (AdoHcy) and the modified m2,2,7G (m3G)-cap (27). The two Sm-proteins SmB and SmD1 of the UsnRNP-core bind to TGS1 in yeast and in human cells suggesting an additional interaction between the dimethyltransferase and the RNP besides the cap (10,26). Although the yeast TGS1 (yTGS1) is not essential for cell viability its deletion results in a cold-sensitive phenotype, as the mutants show reduced growth at lower temperatures as well as missing m3G-caps on certain UsnRNAs and snoRNAs (26). As a consequence of this deletion a splicing defect at restrictive temperatures is observed and linked to the appearance of nucleolar retention of U1snRNAs. Furthermore, the nucleolar morphology is disturbed and the cells show impairment in ribosome biogenesis. However, it turned out that it is the TGS1 protein per se, rather than its catalytic activity that is required for efficient ribosome synthesis (28). In contrast to yTGS1, the orthologs from Xenopus laevis, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens additionally contain large N-terminal domains. The human ortholog of yTGS1 was originally designated PIMT (PRIP-interacting protein with methyltransferase domain) because of its binding capability to PRIP (PPAR-interacting protein) and the presence of the C-terminal methyltransferase domain (29). As shown recently, the purified C-terminal methyltransferase domain of hTGS1 containing the amino acids 576–853 is able to complement the cold-sensitive phenotype of a yeast Δtgs1-strain demonstrating that the human TGS1 methyltransferase domain is a true functional ortholog of the yeast enzyme (30). Hence, H. sapiens PIMT is referred to as hTGS1 with respect to its function and relatedness to yTGS1. It was found that hTGS1 is not only able to bind via its large N-terminus to PRIP, but also to enhance its action. PRIP was shown to interact with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). This suggests that the human TGS1 is a component of the nuclear receptor signal transduction cascade acting through PRIP, and at least in human cells is involved in transcriptional regulation (29). Besides that, hTGS1 was shown to interact with the transcriptional coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP), p300 and PPAR-binding protein (PBP) in vitro and in vivo (31). hTGS1 exists in two isoforms, a full-length cytoplasmic and an N-terminally shortened nuclear form, which might be involved in snoRNP maturation (32,33). In addition it was found in vivo and in vitro, that the C-terminal part of the human cap dimethyltransferase interacts directly with the survival of motor neuron protein (SMNp) (34). This interaction is greatly impaired in vivo as well as in vitro by a SMN mutation (SMNΔEx7) that is most commonly present in patients who are adversely affected by the neuromuscular disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Both proteins are localized in the cytoplasm as well as in the nuclear cajal bodies, where the assembled UsnRNPs and snoRNPs reside (34). Contrary to the comparative mild effects upon deletion of yTGS1, the deletion of its counterpart in D. melanogaster is lethal to the larvae in the early pupal stages indicating an essential function in development (35).

A new, rapid, sensitive, non-extraction batch, and flow injection spectrophotometric method for the determination of cationic surfactants (CSs) such as cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), tetra-n-butyl ammonium chloride (TBAC) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) is proposed. The method is based on the interaction of cationic surfactants with eriochrome black-T to form an ion-association complex. This complex has strong absorbance at 708 nm. The effects of chemical parameters and FIA variables on the determination of cationic surfactants were studied in detail, especially for CTAB.

19428378,"Mitochondrial DNA base excision repair and mitochondrial DNA mutation in human hepatic HuH-7 cells exposed to stavudine. The mitochondrial toxicity of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is due to the inhibition of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma (Pol gamma), resulting in a blockade of mtDNA replication and subsequent disruption of cellular energetics. Because mtDNA Pol gamma is not only involved in mtDNA replication but also responsible for mtDNA repair, we hypothesize that mitochondrial oxidative stress leads to changes in the balance between mtDNA repair and mutation following stavudine (d4T) treatment. However, the mechanisms underlying how changes in mtDNA base excision repair (mtBER) lead to mtDNA mutation remain unclear. To test this hypothesis, total mitochondrial repair capability, different steps of mtBER, mtDNA mutations in D-loop, and oxidative stress were all assessed in cultured HuH-7 human hepatoblast cells treated with d4T for 2 weeks. Assessment by denaturing Southern blotting and quantitative PCR revealed that d4T significantly reduced in vivo repair of H(2)O(2) damaged mtDNA in HuH-7 cells. d4T reduced total in vitro mtBER and DNA Pol gamma capability, but did not affect mtDNA oxoguanine glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity in HuH-7 cells. In addition, d4T treatment is associated with a significant increase in the frequency of mtDNA mutations in HuH-7 cells. In conclusion, d4T treatment reduces mtBER and contributes mechanistically to NRTI-induced mtDNA mutation. These events may potentially be associated with some diseases linked to mtDNA mutation.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,2110,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0021531414,0
19447903,"Survival of pathogenic mycobacteria in macrophages is mediated through autophosphorylation of protein kinase G. Pathogenic mycobacteria survive within macrophages through the inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion. A crucial factor for avoiding lysosomal degradation is the mycobacterial serine/threonine protein kinase G (PknG). PknG is released into the macrophage cytosol upon mycobacterial infection, suggesting that PknG might exert its activity by interfering with host signaling cascades, but the mode of action of PknG remains unknown. Here, we show that PknG undergoes autophosphorylation on threonine residues located at the N terminus. In contrast to all other mycobacterial kinases investigated thus far, autophosphorylation of PknG was not involved in the regulation of its kinase activity. However, autophosphorylation was crucial for the capacity of PknG to promote mycobacterial survival within macrophages. These results will contribute to a better understanding of the virulence mechanisms of pathogenic mycobacteria and may help to design improved inhibitors of PknG to be developed as antimycobacterial compounds.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2114,pos_MEDLINE,0.9859364,1
1949070,"Purification and properties of an antivenom factor from the plasma of the South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terrificus). The lethal toxicity of Crotalus durissus terrificus (Crotalinae, Viperidae) can be attributed mainly to the presence of a neurotoxic protein, crotoxin, which also shows phospholipase A2 activity. It has been previously demonstrated that both lethal and phospholipase A2 activities of crotoxin can be neutralized by an alpha 1-globulin factor that is present in the homologous blood. Crotalus durissus terrificus plasma also renders some degree of protection to mice against the lethal toxicity of heterologous venoms from snakes of the genus Bothrops (Crotalinae, Viperidae), but not of the genus Micrurus (Elapinae, Elapidae). An anti-toxic factor was purified to homogeneity from C.d. terrificus plasma after three chromatographic steps (DEAE-Sephacel anion exchange, CM-Sepharose cation exchange and Pro-RPC reverse phase chromatography); it is named CNF for Crotalus neutralizing factor. The purification process was accompanied by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS and by measurements of phospholipase A2 inhibition. After the first two purification steps, an 86-fold increase of the inhibitory activity of CNF was observed; however, the third step caused an apparent inactivation of the factor. The inactive CNF was shown to correspond to the previously active plasma material and to be homogeneous on electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis and partial amino-terminal sequence.

19553667,"A progesterone receptor co-activator (JDP2) mediates activity through interaction with residues in the carboxyl-terminal extension of the DNA binding domain. Progesterone receptor (PR) belongs to the nuclear receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors and mediates the major biological effects of progesterone. Transcriptional co-activators that are recruited by PR through the carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain have been studied extensively. Much less is known about co-activators that interact with other regions of receptors. Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2) is a PR co-activator that enhances the transcriptional activity of the amino-terminal domain by increasing the alpha-helical content and stability of the intrinsically disordered amino-terminal domain. To gain insights into the mechanism of JDP2 co-activation of PR, the structural basis of JDP2-PR interaction was analyzed using NMR. The smallest regions of each protein needed for efficient protein interaction were used for NMR and included the basic region plus leucine zipper (bZIP) domain of JDP2 and the core zinc modules of the PR DNA binding domain plus the intrinsically disordered carboxyl-terminal extension (CTE) of the DNA binding domain. Chemical shift changes in PR upon titration with JDP2 revealed that most of the residues involved in binding of JDP2 reside within the CTE. The importance of the CTE for binding JDP2 was confirmed by peptide competition and mutational analyses. Point mutations within CTE sites identified by NMR and a CTE domain swapping experiment also confirmed the functional importance of JDP2 interaction with the CTE for enhancement of PR transcriptional activity. These studies provide insights into the role and functional importance of the CTE for co-activator interactions.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2149,pos_MEDLINE,0.9977437,1

Leptospira interrogans is a pathogenic spirochete that causes disease in both humans and animals. LigB (Leptospiral immunoglobulin-like protein B) contributes to the binding of Leptospira to extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin (Fn), fibrinogen, laminin, and collagen. A high affinity Fn-binding region of LigB has been recently localized to LigBCen2, which contains the partial eleventh and full twelfth immunoglobulin-like repeats (LigBCen2R) and 47 amino acids of the non-repeat region (LigBCen2NR) of LigB. In this study, LigBCen2NR was shown to bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Fn (K(D) = 379 nm) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and isothermal titration calorimetry. Interestingly, this sequence was not observed to adopt secondary structure by far UV circular dichroism or by differential scanning calorimetry, in agreement with computer-based secondary structure predictions. A low partition coefficient (K(av)) measured with gel permeation chromatography, a high hydrodynamic radius (R(h)) measured with dynamic light scattering, and the insensitivity of the intrinsic viscosity to guanidine hydrochloride treatment all suggest that LigBCen2NR possesses an extended and disordered structure. Two-dimensional (15)N-(1)H HSQC NMR spectra of intact LigBCen2 in the absence and presence of NTD are consistent with these observations, suggesting the presence of both a beta-rich region and an unstructured region in LigBCen2 and that the latter of these selectively interacts with NTD.

Plakoglobin and beta-catenin are homologous armadillo repeat proteins found in adherens junctions, where they interact with the cytoplasmic domain of classical cadherins and with alpha-catenin. Plakoglobin, but normally not beta-catenin, is also a structural constituent of desmosomes, where it binds to the cytoplasmic domains of the desmosomal cadherins, desmogleins and desmocollins. Here, we report structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies aimed at understanding the molecular basis of selective exclusion of beta-catenin and alpha-catenin from desmosomes. The crystal structure of the plakoglobin armadillo domain bound to phosphorylated E-cadherin shows virtually identical interactions to those observed between beta-catenin and E-cadherin. Trypsin sensitivity experiments indicate that the plakoglobin arm domain by itself is more flexible than that of beta-catenin. Binding of plakoglobin and beta-catenin to the intracellular regions of E-cadherin, desmoglein1, and desmocollin1 was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. Plakoglobin and beta-catenin bind strongly and with similar thermodynamic parameters to E-cadherin. In contrast, beta-catenin binds to desmoglein-1 more weakly than does plakoglobin. beta-Catenin and plakoglobin bind with similar weak affinities to desmocollin-1. Full affinity binding of desmoglein-1 requires sequences C-terminal to the region homologous to the catenin-binding domain of classical cadherins. Although pulldown assays suggest that the presence of N- and C-terminal beta-catenin ""tails"" that flank the armadillo repeat region reduces the affinity for desmosomal cadherins, calorimetric measurements show no significant effects of the tails on binding to the cadherins.

19800308,"Structural and biophysical properties of metal-free pathogenic SOD1 mutants A4V and G93A. INTRODUCTION. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain, eventually leading to paralysis and death [1]. Approximately 90% of cases are termed “sporadic” (sALS), arising without family history or known cause. About 10% of cases have a genetic component and are termed “familial” (fALS), with approximately 20% of fALS cases being linked to dominant mutations in the gene encoding the cytosolic antioxidant enzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) [2, 3]. To date, over 100 different pathogenic SOD1 mutations have been reported (reviewed in [4–9]). A steadily increasing list of mutations can be monitored at http://alsod.iop.kcl.ac.uk/Als. Studies in transgenic mice have established that pathogenic SOD1 proteins elicit motor neuron dysfunction through a gain of a toxic property and not a loss of enzymatic function. Mice expressing human ALS SOD1 polypeptides in addition to their endogenous SOD1 (thereby retaining normal SOD1 activity) become paralyzed [10–13], while SOD1 knockout mice do not [14]. Although the exact nature of this toxicity is not well understood, the observation that insoluble proteinaceous inclusions enriched in pathogenic SOD1 appear concomitant with the onset of paralytic symptoms in these animals suggests that SOD1-linked ALS is a protein misfolding disease [4–9]. Human SOD1 is a 32-kDa homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the detoxification of superoxide anion (O2 −) to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (2O2 − + 2H+ → O2 + H2O2) [15, 16]. Figure 1 shows that each subunit folds as an eight-stranded Greek key β-barrel, binds one copper and one zinc ion, and contains an intrasubunit disulfide bond [17]. The protein-bound copper ion is essential for catalysis, while the protein-bound zinc ion is important to maintain the structural integrity of the enzyme and for the proper positioning of charged residues that assist in the electrostatic guidance of the superoxide substrate into the active site [18, 19]. SOD1 is abundant in brain and spinal cord, presumably because these highly respiring tissues produce copious levels of superoxide as a normal byproduct of respiration. The binding of metal ions and the oxidation of the intrasubunit disulfide bond by nascent SOD1 have been demonstrated to favor dimerization [20–22] and are also known to impart enormous thermal stability to the enzyme. The importance of these posttranslational modifications to the stability of SOD1 in the context of pathogenic SOD1 misfolding and aggregation has focused attention on the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS), a helper protein that recognizes and binds to newly translated SOD1, inserts the catalytic copper ion, and catalyzes the oxidation of the intrasubunit disulfide bond in each SOD1 monomer [23, 24]. Hindering these posttranslational modifications results in immature, metal-deficient and/or disulfide-reduced forms of SOD1 that are increasingly observed as components of the higher order oligomers believed to be relevant in ALS toxicity [25–28]. However, whether the oligomers of pathogenic SOD1 mutants are the causative agents or are symptomatic of motor neuron dysfunction is not yet clear. A rapidly progressing form of ALS arises from mutations at position A4 (A4V, A4T, and A4S), of which A4V is the most common in North American patients. ALS patients harboring the A4V mutation have a mean survival time of only about 1.5 years post diagnosis [29]. Figure 1 shows that A4 is located in the first β-strand that forms part of the dimer interface. Mutations at the A4 position are predicted to affect SOD1 dimerization [30] and/or to destabilize the Greek key β- barrel because A4 packs into the hydrophobic core of the SOD1 monomer. There are six known pathogenic substitutions at G93 (G93A, G93C, G93D, G93R, G93S, and G93V). As shown in Figure 1, G93 is positioned in the short loop V connecting the anti-parallel β-strands 5 and 6, and which is near residues 37 – 42 of loop III. Substitution of G93 is also predicted to destabilize the β-barrel by interfering with the packing of residues that form the “apolar plug” found at one end of the β-barrel [31]. Here, we describe crystal structures of metal-free A4V and metal-bound and metal-free G93A pathogenic SOD1 variants. The structures reveal the destabilizing effects of metal ion deficiency on the conformations of two major loop elements of the enzyme and illuminate intriguing posttranslational modifications of C111 residues in A4V. These data, taken together with data coming from transgenic mouse and cell culture experiments, suggest the hypothesis that SOD1-linked ALS may arise from a general failure of a subset of newly translated pathogenic SOD1 mutants to mature. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PROTEIN EXPRESSION, PURIFICATION, AND DEMETALLATION. DNA fragments encoding the human A4V and G93A mutations were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ligated into the YEP351 plasmid, where expression of the human SOD1 is directed under the control of its own promoter. A4V and G93A SOD1 proteins were expressed, purified, and when appropriate, stripped of their metals as previously described [21]. The metal contents of all SOD1 proteins used in this study were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) at the mass spectrometry facility in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles as described previously [21]. CRYSTALLIZATION AND DATA COLLECTION. Two distinct metal-containing SOD1 samples were used in crystallization experiments. The “metal-bound” G93A SOD1 sample contained the complement of metal ions present after purification, while the “metal-reconstituted” G93A SOD1 sample contained the complement of metal ions present after the purified G93A SOD1 protein is incubated with 1 mM copper and zinc sulfate overnight, followed by dialysis against 2.25 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.5, 150 mM sod",PMC,pos,1,pos,2199,pos_PMC,0.99437994,1

We report the X-ray crystal structure of a phosphodiesterase (PDE) that includes both catalytic and regulatory domains. PDE2A (215-900) crystallized as a dimer in which each subunit had an extended organization of regulatory GAF-A and GAF-B and catalytic domains connected by long alpha-helices. The subunits cross at the GAF-B/catalytic domain linker, and each side of the dimer contains in series the GAF-A and GAF-B of one subunit and the catalytic domain of the other subunit. A dimer interface extends over the entire length of the molecule. The substrate binding pocket of each catalytic domain is occluded by the H-loop. We deduced from comparisons with structures of isolated, ligand-bound catalytic subunits that the H-loop swings out to allow substrate access. However, in dimeric PDE2A (215-900), the H-loops of the two catalytic subunits pack against each other at the dimer interface, necessitating movement of the catalytic subunits to allow for H-loop movement. Comparison of the unliganded GAF-B of PDE2A (215-900) with previous structures of isolated, cGMP-bound GAF domains indicates that cGMP binding induces a significant shift in the GAF-B/catalytic domain linker. We propose that cGMP binding to GAF-B causes movement, through this linker region, of the catalytic domains, such that the H-loops no longer pack at the dimer interface and are, instead, free to swing out to allow substrate access. This increase in substrate access is proposed as the basis for PDE2A activation by cGMP and may be a general mechanism for regulation of all PDEs.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2208,pos_MEDLINE,0.99778724,1

The acquisition of approximately 100 overlapping peptide fragments that redundantly cover the 243-residue apoA-I polypeptide made it possible to define the positions and stabilities of helical segments and to draw inferences about their interactions and dynamic properties. Residues 7-44, 54-65, 70-78, 81-115, and 147-178 form alpha-helices, accounting for a helical content of 48 +/- 3%, in agreement with circular dichroism measurements (49%). At 3 to 5 kcal/mol in free energy of stabilization, the helices are far more stable than could be achieved in isolation, indicating mutually stabilizing helix bundle interactions. However the helical structure is dynamic, unfolding and refolding in seconds, allowing facile apoA-I reorganization during HDL particle formation and remodeling.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2215,pos_MEDLINE,0.99695444,1

19884733,"Morphological analysis of second-intention wound healing in rats submitted to 16 J/cm 2 lambda 660-nm laser irradiation. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been extensively applied to improve wound healing due to some biostimulatory properties presented by laser arrays apparently able to accelerate the cicatricial repair of soft tissue injuries. However, many controversial results have been reported in the literature, probably as a result of the wide sort of different protocols of photobiomodulation employed in those experiments. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of a low-dose protocol of LLT on the intensity of the inflammatory response and the pattern of collagen fibers' deposition during second-intention wound healing in rodents. MATERIALS AND METHODS Standard-sized wounds were carried out in the back of 24 male rats. Half of them underwent LLLT treatment (16 J/cm 2 ) at 660 nm delivered for 7 days. Eight and 14 days after the wounds were performed, the repairing area was removed and stained in HE and Masson's trichrome, and the inflammatory response, epithelization, and collagen fiber depositions were evaluated. RESULTS We found that LLLT was able to slightly reduce the intensity of the inflammatory reaction as well as to enhance substantially the epithelization process at both 8 th and 14 th days. In addition, it also appeared to stimulate the deposition of collagen fibers at the final stages of wound healing.

The virophage Sputnik is a satellite virus of the giant mimivirus and is the only satellite virus reported to date whose propagation adversely affects its host virus' production. Genome sequence analysis showed that Sputnik has genes related to viruses infecting all three domains of life. Here, we report structural studies of Sputnik, which show that it is about 740 A in diameter, has a T=27 icosahedral capsid, and has a lipid membrane inside the protein shell. Structural analyses suggest that the major capsid protein of Sputnik is likely to have a double jelly-roll fold, although sequence alignments do not show any detectable similarity with other viral double jelly-roll capsid proteins.

19892943,"Structure of the LKB1-STRAD-MO25 complex reveals an allosteric mechanism of kinase activation. Loss-of-function mutations in the LKB1 tumor suppressor gene cause the rare inherited disease Peutz-Jeghers cancer Syndrome (PJS) in humans [1] and are associated with various sporadic cancers, in particular non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [2]. One prominent function of LKB1 is to ensure that growth and division are coupled to the availability of cellular energy. LKB1 phosphorylates and activates the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) when energy levels are low, thereby leading to inhibition of signalling pathways that promote proliferation [3]. The therapeutic effects of AMPK-activating drugs (e.g. metformin) on reducing tumor growth [4], or blood glucose levels [5] are dependent on activation of AMPK by LKB1. Another key role of LKB1 is to control cell polarity, which may be mediated by AMPK [6] as well as a group of AMPK-related protein kinases, including microtubule affinity regulating kinases (MARKs, homologous to the C. elegans kinase Par-1) [7] that are also phosphorylated and activated by LKB1 [8]. In cells, LKB1 is found in a 1:1:1 heterotrimeric complex with the pseudokinase STRAD (STe20-Related ADaptor) [9] and the scaffolding MO25 (MOuse protein 25) [10]. There are two closely related human isoforms of both STRAD (STRADα and STRADβ) and MO25 (MO25α and MO25β) that similarly interact with LKB1 [11]. Unlike the majority of protein kinases, which are regulated by phosphorylation, LKB1 is activated by binding to STRAD and MO25 [12,11] through an unknown, phosphorylation-independent, molecular mechanism. Structural analysis of MO25α reveals a helical repeat, horseshoe-shaped protein, that interacts with the C-terminal WEF (Trp-Glu-Phe) motif of STRADα through a hydrophobic pocket, located on its convex C-terminal surface [13]. The structure of STRADα complexed with MO25α reveals additional interactions between the concave surface of MO25α and the regulatory αC helix of STRADα [14]. STRADα, despite being a catalytically inactive pseudokinase, adopts a closed conformation typical of fully active protein kinases. The closed conformation of STRADα is maintained through its cooperative binding to ATP and MO25α. Mutations that inhibit binding to ATP and MO25α prevent LKB1 activation, suggesting that the active conformational state of STRADα may be required for activation of LKB1 [14]. We report the crystal structure of the LKB1-STRADα-MO25α heterotrimeric complex. We used an insect cell expression system to produce an active core LKB1-STRADα-MO25α heterotrimeric complex, comprising the kinase domain of LKB1 (residues 43-347), complexed with the pseudokinase domain of STRADα (residues 59-431) and full length MO25α (Fig. S2). The crystal structure of the heterotrimeric complex with a catalytically inactive mutant of LKB1 (Asp194Ala, preventing Mg2+ ion binding, but not assembly of the complex, Fig. S2B) in complex with the ATP analogue adenyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) was solved and refined to 2.65 Å (Table S1). There are two heterotrimeric complexes in the asymmetric unit displaying similar conformations (RMSD = 0.5 Å on 791 Cα atoms). Both STRADα and LKB1 are in complex with AMP-PNP, displaying binding modes typical of other protein kinases (Fig. S3) [15]. The LKB1 heterotrimer has an overall compact globular shape with considerable interactions between all of the three subunits (Figs. 1A and S4). The pseudokinase domain of STRADα binds to the kinase domain of LKB1. The horseshoe-shaped MO25α acts as a scaffold for assembly of the heterotrimer, by binding both LKB1 and STRADα through highly conserved residues on the concave face of its helical repeats (Figs. 1A and S4B). MO25α binds to STRADα through a large (2930 Å2) interface centred on the regulatory helix αC of STRADα (Fig. 1A). The structure of the STRADα-MO25α complex within the heterotrimer is similar to the binary STRADα-MO25α complex structure [14] (RMSD = 0.5 Å on 529 Cα atoms, Fig. S5), including ordered electron density for the STRADα C-terminal WEF motif interacting with a pocket on MO25α [13,14]. The remaining MO25α concave surface is engaged in contacts (1580 Å2) with the LKB1 activation loop, helix αI and the C-terminus of helix αC (Figs. 1A, S4). The interface between LKB1 and STRADα mainly involves the C-lobe of STRADα and both N- and C-lobes of LKB1 (1840 Å2, Figs. 1C, S4), and is comparable in size to the interaction between LKB1 and MO25α. Activation of LKB1 is thought to be mediated through a conformational change triggered by binding to STRAD and MO25 [12,11]. The structure of the core LKB1 heterotrimer is consistent with this, as LKB1 lacks phosphorylation of the activation loop, yet adopts an active conformation (Fig. S6). The LKB1 αC helix is rotated into the canonical closed conformation, forming the conserved salt bridge between Lys78 (the so-called VAIK motif in subdomain II) and Glu98 (αC-helix in subdomain III, Fig. S6). This active conformation of LKB1 appears to be achieved through contributions of both STRADα and MO25α. Structural elements on the STRADα C-terminal lobe that normally make up the substrate binding site in active protein kinases (i.e. the αG helix [16] and the p+1 loop [15]), interact with LKB1 (Figs. 1B and S7). Furthermore, the activation loop of STRADα interacts with both N- and C-lobes of the LKB1 kinase domain (Fig. 1B). Mutation of residues in the substrate-binding region of STRADα (Leu241 in the p+1 loop and Gln251 in the αEF-αF loop) inhibit interaction with LKB1, whereas mutation of Gln286 (αG helix) had a moderate effect (Fig. 2A). Mutation of Gln251 (αEF-αF loop) alone or in combination with a mutation on STRADα that disrupts the MO25α-STRADα interaction (Tyr185Phe) [14], suppressed LKB1 activation without affecting complex assembly (Fig. 2B). The reciprocal mutation of Arg74 on LKB1 that hydrogen bonds to Gln251 (Fig. 1B) also impairs the ability of STRADα to activate LKB1 without affecting complex assembly (Fig. 2D).

19893533,"Structural insights into the mechanism of abscisic acid signaling by PYL proteins. Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important phytohormone that regulates plant stress responses. Proteins from the PYR-PYL-RCAR family were recently identified as ABA receptors. Upon binding to ABA, a PYL protein associates with type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) such as ABI1 and ABI2, inhibiting their activity; the molecular mechanisms by which PYLs mediate ABA signaling remain unknown, however. Here we report three crystal structures: apo-PYL2, (+)-ABA-bound PYL2 and (+)-ABA-bound PYL1 in complex with phosphatase ABI1. Apo-PYL2 contains a pocket surrounded by four highly conserved surface loops. In response to ABA binding, loop CL2 closes onto the pocket, creating a surface that recognizes ABI1. In the ternary complex, the CL2 loop is located near the active site of ABI1, blocking the entry of substrate proteins. Together, our data reveal the mechanisms by which ABA regulates PYL-mediated inhibition of PP2Cs.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2227,pos_MEDLINE,0.99757034,1
19906968,"Overexpressing temperature-sensitive dynamin decelerates phototransduction and bundles microtubules in Drosophila photoreceptors. INTRODUCTION. The fly orthologue of Dynamin is encoded by shibire (Chen et al., 1991), a GTPase involved in endocytosis (van der Bliek and Meyerowrtz, 1991; Damke et al., 1994). Under previously tested conditions, the temperature-sensitive allele shibirets1 (shits1) allows, normal endocytosis to occur at temperatures below 22°C, but prevents membrane retrieval at temperatures exceeding 30°C, leading to reduced neurotransmitter release and synaptic blockade (Kosaka and Ikeda, 1983). Overexpression of shits1 (Kitamoto, 2001) using the Gal4/UAS system (Brand and Perrimon, 1993) allows targeted temperature-dependent blockade of synaptic transmission within the Drosophila nervous system (for a review see: Duffy, 2002). Hence, the contribution of individual neurons to identified circuits can be assessed (Luo et al., 2008), such as those involved in color (Gao et al., 2008) or motion perception (Rister et al., 2007). Temperature-dependent activation of UAS-shits1 was originally studied in Drosophila photoreceptors (Kitamoto, 2001), from which the continuous release (Zheng et al., 2006) of histamine (Hardie, 1987; Sarthy, 1991), to the Large Monopolar Cells (LMC) (Zheng et al., 2006) is blocked by mutant shits1 at restrictive temperatures. In an Electroretinogram (ERG), the eye’s field potential response to a light pulse (Heisenberg, 1971), such blockade is apparent by the lack of “On”- and “Off”-transients (Zheng et al., 2006), reported by Coombe (1986) to derive from the LMCs. The permissive (18°C) and restrictive (31°C) temperatures for shits1 action, originally defined from their effects on the ERG of homozygous mutant flies (Chen and Stark, 1993), have been confirmed for the UAS-shits1 transgene by recording the ERGs of light-adapted flies overexpressing UAS-shits1 in their photoreceptors (Kitamoto, 2001). Other variables may also affect photoreceptors overexpressing UAS-shits1. For example, light exposure increases endocytosis and membrane turnover in fly photoreceptors (Stark et al., 1988; Bähner et al., 2002; Kosloff et al., 2003; Chorna-Ornan et al., 2005; Frechter et al., 2007; Han et al., 2007). In addition, ageing reduces the time needed for synaptic blockade (Beramendi et al., 2007) and the eye marker gene, white, interacts with shits1 action (Chen and Stark, 1993). A study controlling for these factors in flies overexpressing shibirets1 has hitherto been lacking and should reveal additional functions of dynamin. For example, dynamin may act in vivo as a microtubule associated protein (MAP), an interaction previously demonstrated biochemically (Shpetner and Vallee, 1989). To address dynamin function in vivo, we examine how interactions between light exposure, temperature, genetic background and age affect the synaptic output of outer photoreceptors (R1–R6) overexpressing UAS-shits1. To evaluate changes in neurotransmission, we compare the ERGs. These results are then related to changes in phototransduction, recorded intracellularly through light-evoked voltage responses, and to changes in ultrastructure using electron microscopy, EM. We show that at 19°C, photoreceptors overexpressing UAS-shits1 have decelerated phototransduction and compromised neurotransmission, both after dark-adaptation and in older flies. At 19°C, photoreceptor terminals contain fewer vesicles, vacuolated mitochondria typical of apoptosis and bundled microtubules decorated with dynamin. These changes reveal the outcome of overexpressing a temperature-sensitive form of dynamin that is functionally impaired even at a permissive temperature of 19°C. MATERIALS AND METHODS. FLY STOCKS. The reporter line UAS-shits1 was provided by Dr. Toshihiro Kitamoto (University of Iowa); Canton-S (wild-type), w1118 (here referred to simply as white), Rh1-Gal4 and GMR-Gal4 were acquired from the Bloomington Stock Center. Mutant ort5 (US6096) was a gift from Prof. Roger Hardie (University of Cambridge), MJ85b-Gal4 was a gift from Prof. Leslie C. Griffith (Brandeis University), and hdcJK910 flies were from Prof. Erich Buchner (Julius-Maximilians-Universität, Würzburg). Flies were raised at 18°C in a 12-12 dark-light cycle. Female flies were used for all experiments. UAS-SHITS1 OVEREXPRESSION IN PHOTORECEPTORS. We used the UAS/Gal4 system (Brand and Perrimon, 1993) to overexpress UAS-shits1 and dominate wild-type Dynamin function by the mutant temperature-sensitive form of the protein. The driver Rh1-Gal4 was chosen to ensure that UAS-shits1 was expressed solely in photoreceptors R1–R6. Rh1-Gal4 is expressed only in later stages of pupal development of R1–R6 (Kumar and Ready, 1995). Given the weak expression of Rh1-Gal4, we generated homozygous flies for both the UAS-shits1 and Rh1-Gal4 insertions, and reared them at the permissive temperature, 18°C. Two different types of homozygous Rh1-shits1 flies were used, having either the wild-type eye color (w+), or the white mutation (w1118). In addition, we used GMR-Gal4, which is strongly expressed in all eight photoreceptors, R1–R8, as well as in the supporting cells in the eye imaginal disc (Freeman, 1996). GMR-Gal4 expression, which starts much earlier than Rh1-Gal4 expression, can induce a rough-eye phenotype in homozygous flies when reared at >23°C (Kramer and Staveley, 2003). To prevent a rough-eye phenotype and preserve the normal optics of the compound eyes, we therefore used only heterozygous +; GMR-Gal4/+; UAS-shits1/+ flies reared at 18°C. FLY CROSSES. white Rh1-shits1 flies with insertions of P(ry+, Rh1-Gal4) and P(w+, UAS-shits1) on chromosomes 2 and 3 respectively, were generated by crossing each insertion line to a white double balancer stock (white; If/CyO; MKRS/TM6b) over two generations, to produce white; Rh1-Gal4/CyO; MKRS/TM6b and white; If/CyO; UAS-shits1/TM6b stocks. These stocks were then crossed to each other to produce a balanced Rh1-shits1 stock carrying both insertions (white; Rh1-Gal4/CyO; UAS-shits1/TM6b).

Previous population genetic studies of the Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni Froggatt (Diptera: Tephritidae), in its central range have shown barely detectable genetic differentiation across distances of almost 3000 km (F(st)=0.003). In this study, we investigated the genetic structuring of southern border populations of B. tryoni, in the region extending from the central population to the recently colonized southern range limit. The expectation was that marginal populations would be small, fragmented population sinks, with local adaptation limited by gene flow or drift. Unexpectedly, we found that the population at the southern extreme of the range was a source population, rather than a sink, for the surrounding region. This was shown by assignment testing of recent outbreaks in an adjoining quarantine area and by indirect migration estimates. Furthermore, populations in the region had formed a latitudinal cline in microsatellite allele frequencies, spanning the region between the central population and the southern range limit. The cline has formed within 250 generations of the initial invasion and appears stable between years. We show that there is restricted gene flow in the region and that effective population sizes are of the order of 10(2)-10(3).

20002332,"MtPM25 is an atypical hydrophobic late embryogenesis-abundant protein that dissociates cold and desiccation-aggregated proteins. Late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins are one of the components involved in desiccation tolerance (DT) by maintaining cellular structures in the dry state. Among them, MtPM25, a member of the group 5 is specifically associated with DT in Medicago truncatula seeds. Its function is unknown and its classification as a LEA protein remains elusive. Here, evidence is provided that MtPM25 is a hydrophobic, intrinsically disordered protein that shares the characteristics of canonical LEA proteins. Screening protective activities by testing various substrates against freezing, heating and drying indicates that MtPM25 is unable to protect membranes but able to prevent aggregation of proteins during stress. Prevention of aggregation was also found for the water soluble proteome of desiccation-sensitive radicles. This inhibition was significantly higher than that of MtEM6, one of the most hydrophilic LEA protein associated with DT. Moreover, when added after the stress treatment, MtPM25 is able to rapidly dissolve aggregates in a non-specific manner.

20005203,"Biophysical characterization reveals structural disorder in the developmental transcriptional regulator LBH. INTRODUCTION. Limb-bud and heart (LBH) is a highly conserved tissue-specific transcriptional regulator in vertebrates with important roles in embryonic development [1–3]. Aberrant gain of function of LBH, which maps to human chromosome 2p21, is associated with partial trisomy 2p syndrome, a rare human autosomal disorder with characteristic cardiovascular, skeletal and postaxial limb defects [2]. Moreover, overexpression of LBH during mouse and chick embryogenesis results in dramatic phenotypes, including cardiovascular anomalies, impaired bone formation and angiogenesis [2, 3]. LBH is small nuclear acidic protein of 12.2 kD (105 amino acids) and a theoretical isoelectric point of 4.2 that exhibits no sequence homology to any known protein families [1]. However, a conserved nuclear localization signal and a C-terminal glutamic acid-rich putative transcriptional activation domain in the absence of a DNA-binding domain, hinted that LBH may act as a transcription cofactor [1]. This was confirmed by fusion of LBH to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, which led to transcriptional activation of a reporter gene [1, 4]. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of LBH are required for its transcriptional activity [4]. In heart development, LBH predominantly represses the transcriptional activities of key cardiac transcription factors Nkx2.5 and Tbx5 resulting in inhibition of the expression of a common target gene Nppa [2]. Furthermore, overexpression of LBH during bone development efficiently represses transcription of the key bone transcription factor Runx2 and the pro-angiogenic factor Vegf [3]. Other in vitro studies suggest that LBH may act synergistically with the transcriptional activators AP1 and SRF [4]. Thus, LBH appears to have both transcription co-activator and co-repressor activities. Despite the importance of LBH as a key gene regulator in human development and disease, the structural basis for the function of LBH is not understood. In an effort to understand structure-function relationships, we overexpressed and purified full length LBH in E. coli for biophysical characterization. Employing a diverse array of biophysical techniques, we demonstrate that native LBH is intrinsically disordered with no discernable secondary or tertiary structure exuding rod-like properties in solution. Our structural characterization of LBH provides further insight into the transcription regulator function of LBH in mechanistic terms. MATERIALS AND METHODS. CLONING, PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. The murine Lbh open reading frame (Image Clone 6813866; ATCC) was cloned via BamHI and SmaI sites into pGEX2T vector (Promega) using PCR technology. The pGEX2T-LBH expression vector was transformed into E. coli BL21 Star™ (DE3) cells (Invitrogen). A single colony of transformed cells was grown in 50 mL PG minimal medium (50 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM Na2SO4) supplemented with 100 µg/mL carbenicillin, 2 mM MgSO4, 56 mM NH4Cl, 0.6% glucose, and 0.2× of a trace metal mixture [5] at 37°C overnight to make a starter culture. Upon inoculation of 15 mL of starter culture in 500 mL of PG medium plus supplements, the culture was allowed to grow at 37°C to an optical cell density of OD600 = 0.8. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl- β-dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and the culture was grown for an additional 4 h at 37°C before harvesting. For 15N-isotopic labeling of LBH, NH4Cl in the culture medium was replaced with an identical amount of 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.). Cells (~3 g/500 mL of culture) were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 500 mM NaCl (4 mL/g of cells), and lyzed in GST-binding buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol; 10 mL/g of cells) using an EmulsiFlex-C3 homogenizer (Avestin, Inc.). After centrifugation for 30 min at 35,000g, the soluble fraction containing the GST-LBH fusion protein was loaded at a flow rate of 1 mL/min onto tandem 5 mL GSTrap FF affinity columns (equilibrated at 4°C in GST-binding buffer) connected to an AKTAbasic 100 Explorer FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The columns were washed with 50 mL of GST-binding buffer containing 0.01% Triton X-100, and subsequently with detergent free GST-binding buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm returned to baseline. GST-LBH protein was eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 mM glutathione. Fractions containing the GST-LBH protein were combined and exchanged back into GST-binding buffer using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). The GST affinity tag was cleaved off with 10 units of Thrombin (GE Healthcare) per mg of GST fusion protein and incubation at 4 °C for 16 h. The cleavage reaction was loaded (1 mL/min) onto the tandem GSTrap FF affinity columns, which retained cleaved GST and any uncleaved GST-LBH. The cleaved LBH that was not retained was collected, concentrated to ~1 mL using a 3K ultrafiltration concentrator (Millipore) and loaded onto a Superdex™ 75 16/60 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated at 4 °C in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and 250 mM NaCl.

20026641,"Identification of beta-catenin as a target of the intracellular tyrosine kinase PTK6. Disruption of the gene encoding protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) leads to increased growth, impaired enterocyte differentiation and higher levels of nuclear beta-catenin in the mouse small intestine. Here, we demonstrate that PTK6 associates with nuclear and cytoplasmic beta-catenin and inhibits beta-catenin- and T-cell factor (TCF)-mediated transcription. PTK6 directly phosphorylates beta-catenin on Tyr64, Tyr142, Tyr331 and/or Tyr333, with the predominant site being Tyr64. However, mutation of these sites does not abrogate the ability of PTK6 to inhibit beta-catenin transcriptional activity. Outcomes of PTK6-mediated regulation appear to be dependent on its intracellular localization. In the SW620 colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, nuclear-targeted PTK6 negatively regulates endogenous beta-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity, whereas membrane-targeted PTK6 enhances beta-catenin/TCF regulated transcription. Levels of TCF4 and the transcriptional co-repressor TLE/Groucho increase in SW620 cells expressing nuclear-targeted PTK6. Knockdown of PTK6 in SW620 cells leads to increased beta-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity and increased expression of beta-catenin/TCF target genes Myc and Survivin. Ptk6-null BAT-GAL mice, containing a beta-catenin-activated LacZ reporter transgene, have increased levels of beta-galactosidase expression in the gastrointestinal tract.

Due to their apparently transient existence, the pro-peptides of NGF and other neurotrophins (NTs) have been thought to function only to promote protein folding and regulate neurotrophin secretion.4; 5 However, recent studies demonstrate that proNGF can be released by cells and is a specific signaling ligand to mediate cellular apoptosis.6 This was a surprising finding not only because the unprocessed form is biologically active ligand in its own right, but because the mature and pro-forms of NGF execute opposing actions. Subsequent studies demonstrated that pro- and mature NGF mediate their functions via binding to distinct receptor complexes. NGF binds to two classes of transmembrane receptor: TrkA, a Tyrosine Kinase receptors superfamily member7 and p75NTR, a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) receptor family member.8 All NTs bind to p75NTR while each NT preferentially interacts with a different Trk receptor subtype (TrkA, B, or C). Although p75NTR can respond to mature neurotrophins independently, Trk receptors are the key mediators of the trophic function, while p75NTR appears to enhance the binding affinity and specificity of Trk receptors for neurotrophins, as well as mediate apoptotic functions.9; 10 With regards to structural studies, NGF crystal structures have been available in its free form,11 in complex with p75NTR,12 and in complex with TrkA.13; 14. In contrast to NGF, both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that proNGF preferentially interacts with p75NTR, but not TrkA, and plays an important role in cell death induction.6; 15 Increased proNGF is observed in pathological conditions resulting in neuronal cell death, such as seizures, spinal cord injury (SCI) and the Alzheimer’s disease.16; 17; 18; 19 Delivery of antibodies to proNGF, chemicals preventing proNGF binding to p75NTR, or drugs inhibiting proNGF synthesis significantly attenuates neuronal death.17; 19; 20 In addition, sortilin, a member of a novel Vps10p-domain receptor family, was identified as a co-receptor in a proNGF-induced apoptosis complex.15 Sortilin is an important component, as demonstrated by the reduction in proNGF-induced retinal ganglion cell death in sortilin-deficient embryos,21 and its co-expression with p75NTR in neurons undergoing selective elimination.22; 23; 24; 25 These functional studies, together with crosslinking analysis, indicate that proNGF simultaneously binds sortilin and p75NTR, creating a ternary complex that activates neuronal apoptosis.15 Therefore, the choice between life and death of neurons may be a delicate balance between cleavage or non-cleavage of proNGF, and expression of TrkA or p75NTR/sortilin receptor complexes on the cell surface. The molecular basis underlying the signaling by the proNGF-mediated death complex largely remains elusive, but it is known that the pro- and mature domains of proNGF bind to sortilin and p75NTR, respectively.15 Two crystal structures available for mature NTs (NGF and NT-3) complexed to p75NTR have shown asymmetric (2:1) and symmetric (2:2) binding stoichiometries with p75NTR.12; 26 Unlike the ligand-induced dimerization mechanism for NGF activation of TrkA through 2:2 receptor complexes,13; 14 a ligand-induced conformational change in a preformed p75NTR dimer is the likely activation mechanism,27 raising the question of the implications of the 2:1 NGF/p75NTR versus the 2:2 NT-3/p75NTR complexes. For proNGF, crystallographic analysis of the pro-peptide domain has been hindered because of its intrinsic flexibility and susceptibility to cleavage. Information to date using E.coli-derived proNGF indicates a flexible structure, with a possible intramolecular interaction of the NGF pro-peptide domain with the mature region,28 and a crab-like overall shape predicted by a combination of antibody epitope-mapping and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS).29 Despite the significant advance of a crystal structure of sortilin with the neuropeptide neurotensin,30 no information is available on how sortilin interacts with proNGF. The aim of the present study is to characterize biochemically and structurally proNGF in complex with p75NTR and in the full ternary complex with sortilin, to gain insight into the docking geometry and stoichiometry of the complex, and to begin to reconcile recent structural data on the contrasting stoichiometries of the NT-3/p75NTR and NGF/p75NTR complexes. Our structural, biochemical and cell-based studies thus improve the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which proNGF and mature neurotrophins interact with their receptors. RESULTS. PROPERTIES OF CLEAVAGE-RESISTANT TRIPLE-MUTANT PRONGF. ProNGF can undergo post-translational cleavage in vivo and in vitro to yield several products, making it difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of stable and biologically active proNGF for structural and cellular studies. Thus, most studies on proNGF structure have used material refolded from E. coli, despite being substantially less potent compared to that secreted in active form from a eukaryotic source. Insect cell-derived proNGF, in which one or more of the potential dibasic amino acid cleavage consensus sites have been mutated, does not require refolding and is biologically active 31. To obtain sufficient quantities of recombinant proNGF for crystallographic analysis, we performed alanine mutagenesis for three processing sites of mouse proNGF and expressed this material in insect cells (Figure 1A). Compared to a single processing site mutant proNGF (mutated amino acids -1, -2) (data not shown), triple-site mutant proNGF (mutated",PMC,pos,1,pos,2266,pos_PMC,0.9974738,1

After undergoing initial reconstructive surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome performed between August 1985 and March 1989, 59 patients (age range 3 to 27 months, mean 13.8 +/- 4.5) underwent elective cardiac catheterization in anticipation of a modified Fontan procedure. Five important hemodynamic and anatomic features considered to be components of successful reconstructive surgery were specifically addressed. 1) Interatrial communication: Only two patients had a measured pressure difference of greater than 4 mm Hg across the atrial septum. 2) Tricuspid valve function: Angiography demonstrated significant tricuspid valve regurgitation in only five patients (moderate in two and severe in three). 3) Aortic arch: Pressure tracings from the right ventricle to the descending aorta revealed a gradient greater than 25 mm Hg in only two patients. 4) Pulmonary vasculature: Ten patients had a calculated pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 4 U.m2; 51 (86%) of the 59 patients had no evidence of distortion (stenosis or hypoplasia) of either the left or the right pulmonary artery. 5) Right ventricular function: Five patients had an end-diastolic pressure in the right ventricle greater than 12 mm Hg and two patients had qualitative assessment of decreased ventricular function. Comparison of catheterization data between survivors and nonsurvivors of the subsequent modified Fontan procedure showed that only significant tricuspid regurgitation is a possible predictor of poor outcome.

20088881,"Targeting mechanism of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor by a prototypical viral oncoprotein. Structural modularity, intrinsic disorder and phosphorylation of human papillomavirus E7. DNA tumor viruses ensure genome amplification by hijacking the cellular replication machinery and forcing infected cells to enter the S phase. The retinoblastoma (Rb) protein controls the G1/S checkpoint, and is targeted by several viral oncoproteins, among these the E7 protein from human papillomaviruses (HPVs). A quantitative investigation of the interaction mechanism between the HPV16 E7 protein and the RbAB domain in solution revealed that 90% of the binding energy is determined by the LxCxE motif, with an additional binding determinant (1.0 kcal.mol(-1)) located in the C-terminal domain of E7, establishing a dual-contact mode. The stoichiometry and subnanomolar affinity of E7 indicated that it can bind RbAB as a monomer. The low-risk HPV11 E7 protein bound 2.0 kcal.mol(-1) more weakly than the high-risk HPV16 and HPV18 type counterparts, but the modularity and binding mode were conserved. Phosphorylation at a conserved casein kinase II site in the natively unfolded N-terminal domain of E7 affected the local conformation by increasing the polyproline II content and stabilizing an extended conformation, which allowed for a tighter interaction with the Rb protein. Thus, the E7-RbAB interaction involves multiple motifs within the N-terminal domain of E7 and at least two conserved interaction surfaces in RbAB. We discussed a mechanistic model of the interaction of the Rb protein with a viral target in solution, integrated with structural data and the analysis of other cellular and viral proteins, which provided information about the balance of interactions involving the Rb protein and how these determine the progression into either the normal cell cycle or transformation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2283,pos_MEDLINE,0.9979771,1
20098687,"Crystal structure and substrate specificity of Drosophila 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase. INTRODUCTION. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) decarboxylase (DDC) is a pyridoxal-5′-phophate (PLP)-dependent enzyme which physiologically catalyzes the decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine to dopamine, and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) to 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) [1], [2]. Because the enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of other aromatic L-amino acids as well, it is commonly named aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. The enzyme is present in the majority of living species from select bacteria to humans. DDC from mammals and insects has attracted significant attention because both dopamine and serotonin serve as classical neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, or neurohormones [3], [4], [5], [6]. A DDC inhibitor is being used in conjunction with DOPA in humans for the treatment of Parkinson's disease [7]. In insects DDC occupies a special position because dopamine is a key precursor in insect cuticle formation [8], [9], eggshell hardening [10], [11] and is involved in immune responses [8], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. A protein BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search using pig DDC sequence shows that Drosophila has at least five aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylases or DDC-like sequences, but mammals have only one. In Drosophila, one of the five DDC-like sequences is the typical DDC, two of the DDC-like sequences have been proposed to be tyrosine decarboxylases, and the other two DDC-like sequences have been named α-methyl DOPA-resistant proteins. The role of tyrosine decarboxylase was proposed for two of the DDC-like sequences based on the negative effect on tyramine production of their mutations [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], but the biochemical characteristics of these proposed tyrosine decarboxylases have not been clearly established. The α-methyl DOPA-resistant protein was named based on the observation that Drosophila having this protein were resistant to the toxic compound α-methyl DOPA [23], [24], [25], [26]. The insect DDC-like sequences share high sequence identity with one another (>40%) and their level of identity increases to ∼50% when only their putative catalytic domains are compared. The presence of multiple DDC-like sequences in insects raises an important question – why have multiple DDC-like sequences evolved in insects and what are their structure-function relationships? In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the typical Drosophila DDC (drDDC). Based on what we found in the structure, we further performed site-directed mutagenesis of the enzyme, tested the substrate specificity and identified residues that affect the substrate binding affinity and the turnover number of the enzyme. Our results provide insight into substrate specificity for drDDC. RESULTS. BIOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF DRDDC WILD-TYPE (WT) AND MUTANT PROTEINS. Three site directed mutations, T82A, T82S and H192W, as well as the wildtype drDDC were investigated. Based on SDS-PAGE analysis, all four recombinant proteins were of high purity (data not shown). Freezing and thawing did not result in activity changes of the isolated enzymes. drDDC WT protein was tested for optimal temperature and pH. It showed maximum activity at 30 to 60°C (Fig. 1a), and at pH 7 (Fig. 1b). OVERALL STRUCTURE. The structure of drDDC was determined by molecular replacement and refined to 1.75 Å resolution with excellent statistics (Table 1). The final model contains 2×448 amino acid residues and yields a crystallographic R value of 19.7% and an Rfree value of 22.6%. All residues in the two subunits are in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, as defined with PROCHECK [27]. Table 1 illustrates refinement statistics of drDDC and the statistics on Ramachandran plot. There are two protein molecules in an asymmetric unit, which forms a biological homodimer. The fragment of V322 to P348 of both subunits in the structure was highly disordered; therefore, they were not included in the final drDDC model. An overview of the dimeric structure model is illustrated in Fig. 2a. Each of the two monomers is composed of three distinct domains (Fig. 2b). The large domain (Residues 86–380) contains a seven-stranded beta sheet, and the small domain comprises the C-terminal part of the chain (residues 380–475), which folds into a 4-stranded beta sheet covered with helices on one side. Based on the above features of the structure, drDDC is a fold-type I PLP-dependent enzyme [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. In addition to these two domains, drDDC contains an additional N-terminal domain (residues 1–85). This domain is composed of two parallel helices and one small helix. This structure lies like a flap over the top of the second subunit and vice versa, with the first helix of one subunit aligning antiparallel to the equivalent helix of the other subunit. The drDDC architecture represents the same sub-fold type as that of pig DDC [33]. COFACTOR BINDING SITE. The active site of drDDC is located near the monomer-monomer interface but is composed mainly of residues from one monomer (Fig. 3). The cofactor PLP binds to K302 through a Schiff base linkage to form an internal aldimine, lysine-pyridoxal-5-phosphate (LLP). The carboxyl group of D270 and the protonated pyridine nitrogen of PLP form a pair of salt bridges, which is structurally and functionally conserved within fold-type I of the PLP-dependent enzyme family. The cofactor is further anchored to the protein through an extended hydrogen bond network and hydrophobic interaction. The PLP pyridine ring is stacked between residues A272 on one side and H192 on the other side. The phosphate moiety of PLP is anchored by polar interactions with the peptide amide groups of residues A148 and S149 as well as by the side chains of S149, N299, and two water molecules. PLP also interacts with one residue from the other subunit, F103*. All residues involved in PLP binding in drDDC are conserved with those involved in the PLP binding sites in pig DDC.

Neuronal specification is regulated by the activity of transcription factors containing the basic helix-loop-helix motif (bHLH); these regulating proteins include, among others, the neurogenin (Ngn) family, related to the atonal family of genes. Neurogenin 1 (NGN1) is a 237-residue protein that contains a bHLH domain and is involved in neuronal differentiation. In this work, we synthesized the bHLH region of NGN1 (bHLHN) comprising residues 90-150 of the full-length NGN1. The domain is a monomeric natively unfolded protein with a pH-dependent premolten globule conformation, as shown by several spectroscopic techniques (namely, NMR, fluorescence, FTIR, and circular dichroism). The unfolded character of the domain also explains, first, the impossibility of its overexpression in several Escherichia coli strains and, second, its insolubility in aqueous buffers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive study of the conformational preferences of a bHLH domain under different solution conditions. Upon binding to two DNA E-boxes, the protein forms ""fuzzy"" complexes (that is, the complexes were not fully folded).

20107563,"A comparison of the modified score for the assessment of chronic rheumatoid affections of the hands and the australian/canadian osteoarthritis hand index in hand osteoarthritis patients. 1. INTRODUCTION. Hand osteoarthritis (HOA) is a highly prevalent condition, which can result in considerable disability. [1] In comparison with the diagnostic and therapeutic efforts concerning knee or hip OA, HOA was neglected for quite some time—either due to its unspectacularity or due to a number of difficulties in its diagnosis and classification. Driven by European Standing Committee for International Clinical Studies including Therapeutics (ESCISIT), separate evidence-based recommendations for hip and knee OA were developed between 2000 and 2005. In September 2005, the members of the EULAR OA task force met for the first time to start developing recommendations primarily for the management and afterwards for the diagnosis of HOA—thus emphasizing the importance of this clinical topic [2, 3]. Already in 1999, the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) agreed upon core outcomes for clinical trials in hand osteoarthritis (HOA) and these efforts have been renewed at the OARSI OA meeting in Boston in December 2005 [4, 5]. These respective core outcomes include pain, functional index, patient's global assessment (PGA), structure, number of painful or tender joints, grip strength, and pinch strength. There was further agreement that patients' self-reported difficulty with daily activities should be assessed with a valid and reliable measure [4]. Some efforts to develop scoring systems for rheumatoid affections of the little finger joints have been made in the past. Two of them, the algofunctional index functional index for hand osteoarthritis (FIHOA) by Dreiser and the rheumatoid hand functional disability scale by Duruoz only assess the functional handicap of patients [6, 7]. These two scores, furthermore, are administered by interviewers which might result in bias due to interaction between the patient and the interviewer [8]. We attempted to create a self-administered instrument which did not only include a functional index but also incorporated pain and stiffness and therefore designed the score for the assessment and quantification of chronic rheumatic affections of the hands, the SACRAH, in 1999 [9]. Bellamy et al. created a comparable score, following the well-established pattern of the WOMAC and exclusively dealing with HOA, the AUSCAN [8, 10, 11]. In this context, it seems questionable, whether an instrument is capable of targeting HOA exclusively. As both AUSCAN and M-SACRAH meet the requirements of the OARSI hand osteoarthritis core outcomes, yet have been designed by different approaches, we compared both scores in one HOA patient group to verify possible differences or similarities in the assessment of the status and outcomes of these patients. Special emphasis of our investigation was put on possible differences between the two scores concerning their results in different genders. A further goal was to investigate possible differences in the responsiveness of the two scores to therapeutic interventions. 2. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Between August 2003 and April 2005, the four authors were assessing patients at the outpatient clinic of our department. Having been diagnosed with HOA according to the ACR criteria by one of the four, patients were included consecutively into the study [12]. Thus, sixty six outpatients completed both questionnaires. 2.1. QUESTIONNAIRES UNDER COMPARISON. 2.1.1. SACRAH/M-SACRAH. In brief, the SACRAH encompasses 23 VAS (100 mm) covering the three categories functional impairment (18 items), stiffness (2 items), and pain (4 items). This score has been validated in 69 HOA and 103 RA patients [13]. In 2004, we presented a modified and shortened version of the SACRAH, the M-SACRAH to simplify the questionnaire's use for the patient [14]. The M-SACRAH—as well as its predecessor, the SACRAH—has been established and validated in German and also consists of 3 domains including 12 items, namely, 8 targeting function, 2 targeting stiffness, and 2 targeting pain. It has, meanwhile, been translated to English according to standardized procedures. Meanwhile, the questionnaire has been translated to English and Serbocroatian according to standardized procedures and has been validated in a Serbian patient group [15]. Data of the principal component analysis are given in Table 6. 2.1.2. AUSCAN-QUESTIONNAIRE. The AUSCAN has been established in English, exclusively dealing with HOA patients and finally published in 2002. It exists in a Likert version, a numerical rating scale (NRS), and in a VAS format [8, 10, 11]. It comprises 15 items covering pain (n = 5), stiffness (n = 1), and function (n = 9). The distribution of questions among the three categories, however, is to some extent different from the M-SACRAH. For the purpose of this study, the VAS-version was used, as the M-SACRAH also encompasses VAS-scales. As the AUSCAN questionnaire is not in the public domain and thus not unrestrictedly available, the candidate items from the publication were used to generate a German version for this specific study. This was done by two professional English-German translaters, one translating the questionnnaire from English into German, the other one translating it back into English. Since the English translation from the German version matched the original AUSCAN questionnaire, the German version was considered primarily valid for the use in this study. The detailed items of the questionnaire are shown in Table 1. Construct validity of this German version was assessed carrying out principal component analysis (Table 7). The main difference between the two questionnaires relates to the importance of stiffness and pain. While the AUSCAN distinguishes between pain on several activities, the M-SACRAH asks for pain at work in general and for pain at rest. Regarding stiffness only morning stiffness is covered by the AUSCAN. The M-SACRAH, however, also asks for starting stiffness during the day. 2.1.3.

20133840,"Structural insights into phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation by the influenza A virus NS1 protein. Seasonal epidemics and periodic worldwide pandemics caused by influenza A viruses are of continuous concern. The viral nonstructural (NS1) protein is a multifunctional virulence factor that antagonizes several host innate immune defenses during infection. NS1 also directly stimulates class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, an essential cell survival pathway commonly mutated in human cancers. Here, we present a 2.3-A resolution crystal structure of the NS1 effector domain in complex with the inter-SH2 (coiled-coil) domain of p85beta, a regulatory subunit of PI3K. Our data emphasize the remarkable isoform specificity of this interaction, and provide insights into the mechanism by which NS1 activates the PI3K (p85beta:p110) holoenzyme. A model of the NS1:PI3K heterotrimeric complex reveals that NS1 uses the coiled-coil as a structural tether to sterically prevent normal inhibitory contacts between the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85beta and the p110 catalytic subunit. Furthermore, in this model, NS1 makes extensive contacts with the C2/kinase domains of p110, and a small acidic alpha-helix of NS1 sits adjacent to the highly basic activation loop of the enzyme. During infection, a recombinant influenza A virus expressing NS1 with charge-disruption mutations in this acidic alpha-helix is unable to stimulate the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate or the phosphorylation of Akt. Despite this, the charge-disruption mutations in NS1 do not affect its ability to interact with the p85beta inter-SH2 domain in vitro. Overall, these data suggest that both direct binding of NS1 to p85beta (resulting in repositioning of the N-terminal SH2 domain) and possible NS1:p110 contacts contribute to PI3K activation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2298,pos_MEDLINE,0.99771273,1
20152057,"Inter-annual variation in prevalence and intensity of mite parasitism relates to appearance and expression of damselfly resistance. BACKGROUND. The factors that cause variation in parasitism and host resistance in natural populations have important implications for the ecology and evolution of both hosts and parasites. Characteristics such as host population size have long been known to affect parasite population dynamics [1], and attention has recently turned to the effects of host sex and age on parasitism and resistance (reviewed by [2]). The effects of abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation on host-parasite interactions also are increasingly being recognized [3-6] and might have effects on whether or not resistance to parasites is expressed. Host resistance to parasites can be behavioral, physiological or mechanical. Not all host species or populations respond immunologically to parasitism [7,8], and there can be variation in response within a species (e.g., between sexes [9]). Physiological resistance by invertebrates is commonly a cell-mediated response that involves encapsulation around a foreign invader by haemocytes. The pro-phenoloxidase enzymatic cascade then kills the parasite through the synthesis of melanin, which has cytotoxic and antimicrobial properties [10,11]. This type of resistance has been shown to vary due to biotic [10,11] and abiotic [12-15] factors, and can have a heritable component [12,16,17]. Our knowledge of the genetic basis of resistance in animals is increasing [18-21], but the degree to which resistance can be a plastic response to environmental variation in natural populations is not well understood. Maintaining immune defenses is costly [22,23], and therefore subject to evolutionary tradeoffs with other important traits, such as competitive ability, reproductive success and survival. These tradeoffs have been demonstrated in many laboratory studies [24-35] that have added to our understanding of life history evolution and immune defense. However, the factors affecting resistance may differ under natural conditions; resistance variation might depend on temperature, resource availability and host and parasite abundance [2,35]. In temperate damselflies, seasonal variation in body size and timing of emergence can be associated with environmental factors such as air temperature and photoperiod [36]. There is also seasonal and inter-annual variation in parasitism by mites [37]. Larval water mites can be resisted physiologically by their odonate hosts, shortly after hosts eclose from their aquatic larval stage. If melanotic encapsulation of the mite feeding tube occurs, it is initiated within 24 h of host emergence. There is evidence that melanotic encapsulation is affected by air temperature under controlled conditions [14,15]. It is also known that the effects of engorging mites on odonates can be severe, as they can affect perching and flight [38,39], cause cellular and tissue damage [40], reduce body fat content [41], reduce mating success [42] and lower fecundity [38,42]. We examined host resistance to a specialist mite in a damselfly population over seven seasons to determine whether variation in abiotic and biotic factors was correlated with variation in resistance. Larvae of the mite Arrenurus pollictus are phoretic on the final aquatic larval instars of the damselfly Lestes disjunctus. When the damselflies eclose, the mites pierce the host cuticle and begin to feed. When damselflies return to water to mate and oviposit, the fully engorged mites drop off their hosts to complete their development in the water. We measured mite prevalence (the percentage of individuals in the sample that were parasitized by one or more mites) and intensity (the number of parasites per infested host, following [43]) on hosts from 2002-2008. We monitored damselfly emergence timing and wing length (a correlate of body size). We also recorded air temperature before emergence and during the flight period each year. RESULTS. EMERGENCE OF PRE-REPRODUCTIVE DAMSELFLIES. The numbers of newly emerged damselflies caught in emergence traps varied considerably among years (analyses were based on 6 years of data, as emergence traps were not deployed in 2007). 2003 was an anomalous year with more than twice the average number of the other years (Additional file 1: Table S1; Figure 1). It was also the only year with a female biased sex ratio (χ2 = 11.78, p = 0.0006). There were no differences between the sexes in the starting dates or durations of the emergence period, so single yearly values are reported in Additional file 1: Table S1. Numbers of parasites on hosts caught in emergence traps varied considerably over the study period (Figure 1). The total numbers of mites ranged from a low of 310 (in 2008 for 75 hosts) to a high of 9174 (for 169 hosts in 2004). A dramatic increase in the parasite population size from 2002-2004 was followed by a decrease in host numbers in 2004 and 2005, which was followed by a decline in parasite numbers in 2005. Resistance first appeared in the host population in 2004, as parasite numbers reached their peak (and host numbers were declining; Figure 1). Prevalence of mites in the L. disjunctus population increased from 86% to 100% in the second year of the study, and declined to 77% in the last year (Additional file 1: Table S1; Figure 2). This inter-annual variation in prevalence was significant (Log-linear χ2 = 49.5, df = 5, p = 0.006). Although there was a trend for higher parasite prevalence in females than in males each year, this was not statistically significant except in 2008 (χ2 = 5.21, p = 0.003). Females were larger than males each year based on wing lengths (used as a proxy of size (Additional file 1: Table S1)), and there was a significant, unexpected, increase in wing length in both females (F1,469 = 44.41, p < 0.0001) and males (F1,338 = 30.79, p < 0.0001; Additional file 1: Table S1) over the seven-year study period. Intensity of parasitism varied yearly, and was highest in 2004 with an average of 54 mites per infested host (Additional file 1: Table S1).",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,2302,far_neg_PMC,0.0027737827,0

Selenocysteine lyase (SCL) catalyzes the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent removal of selenium from l-selenocysteine to yield l-alanine. The enzyme is proposed to function in the recycling of the micronutrient selenium from degraded selenoproteins containing selenocysteine residue as an essential component. The enzyme exhibits strict substrate specificity toward l-selenocysteine and no activity to its cognate l-cysteine. However, it remains unclear how the enzyme distinguishes between selenocysteine and cysteine. Here, we present mechanistic studies of selenocysteine lyase from rat. ESI-MS analysis of wild-type and C375A mutant SCL revealed that the catalytic reaction proceeds via the formation of an enzyme-bound selenopersulfide intermediate on the catalytically essential Cys-375 residue. UV-visible spectrum analysis and the crystal structure of SCL complexed with l-cysteine demonstrated that the enzyme reversibly forms a nonproductive adduct with l-cysteine. Cys-375 on the flexible loop directed l-selenocysteine, but not l-cysteine, to the correct position and orientation in the active site to initiate the catalytic reaction.

Fatty acid biosynthesis is vital for the virulence and pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a deadly pathogen [1], [2]. The first committed step in lipid biosynthesis is the biotinylation of Acetyl Coenzyme A Carboxylase (ACC) mediated by biotin acetyl-CoA carboxylase ligase/biotin protein ligase (BirA) [3]–[5]. It has been shown that BirA is interchangeable between organisms [3], [6] suggesting conserved enzyme-substrate interactions. Yet, a recent biochemical study on Mtb-BirA has revealed significant differences in the ligand-binding properties of this enzyme compared to BirAs from various other organisms [7]. Therefore, on one hand, BirA appears to be an attractive target for the development of broad spectrum therapeutic agents against multiple infections, while on the other, it also appears to be ideal for the development of species-specific novel anti-infective agent. Several crystal structures of both monofunctional and bifunctional BirAs [8], [9] from many genera have been determined either as apoenzyme or as complex with its ligands (Table 1) [10]–[14]. All the apo BirA crystal structures have revealed the presence of disordered flexible loops, which undergo a conformational transition upon biotin and biotinyl-5′-AMP binding. These loops are known to participate in either dimer interface or ligand-binding or both. The apo Escherichia coli (Ec) BirA has four-disordered loops - biotin binding loop:BBL, adenylate binding loop:ABL, dimer loop I:DLI and dimer loop II:DLII. Binding of ligands induces dimerization of EcBirA and structural ordering of these loops [12], [15]–[17]. However, Pyrococcus horikoshii (Ph) BirA exists as a dimer in both the liganded and unliganded forms [13] and the crystal structure of its apo form shows only one disordered loop (BBL) [10], [11]. Similarly, in the crystal structure of BirA from M. tuberculosis (Mtb-BirA), two such loops and a few residues at the N-terminal are missing (Ma and Wilmanns, PDB deposition 2cgh, 2006). Elucidation of molecular structure of these disordered loops may provide insights into species-specific behavior of Mtb-BirA towards its ligands. As reported earlier, the transfer of Mtb-BirA crystals to paraffin and paratone-N oil (cryoprotectants) and subsequent flash freezing resulted in the dehydration of the crystals and significantly reduced their solvent content [18]. Though the crystals diffracted at 2.69 Å, not better than the 1.8 Å data available in PDB for Mtb-BirA (2cgh), the most fortunate effect of the dehydration in our case turned out to be tracing of the structure of otherwise disordered ligand-binding loops absent in 2cgh and other apo BirAs. Involvement of these mobile loops in the biotinylation reaction is indispensable and hence the knowledge of their structure is critical for new leads into protein-ligand interactions. The conditions used in this study for the crystallization of Mtb-BirA protein were different from the one reported in 2cgh PDB entry. Hence, to eliminate the effects arising out of these differences, the Mtb-BirA structure (2.8 Å) was also determined with normal hydration for the purpose of comparison. The dehydrated crystal structure of apo Mtb-BirA reported here provides the active structure of the disordered loops involved in the ligand-binding and functioning of BirA. Since in a dehydrated crystal, protein molecules are more densely packed leading to enhanced intermolecular contacts amongst themselves, dehydration emerges as a simple approach for restricting the conformational flexibility of the loop regions. Furthermore, partial reduction in the crystal's bulk solvent results in entrapping a state, where two protein subunits related by a non-crystallographic twofold axis co-exist in two conformations - (1) the usual inactive apo form and (2) the active ligand bound form, thus violating the symmetry of the dimer. RESULTS. PURIFICATION AND OLIGOMERIC STATUS OF MTB-BIRA. Recombinant Mtb-BirA was overexpressed in E. coli and purified by Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography (Figure 1a). The subunit composition of the purified protein was determined by gel filtration chromatography using standard protein markers (Figure 1b). Based on the chromatographic profile, the Mtb-BirA corresponds to a monomer in solution as reported by Purushothaman et al. [7]. STRUCTURES OF DEHYDRATED AND HYDRATED MTB-BIRA CRYSTALS. Structures of dehydrated (dhMtb-BirA) and hydrated (hMtb-BirA) Mtb-BirA, were determined at 2.69 Å and 2.8 Å, respectively, using crystals grown under similar conditions. The hydrated structure contains 44% solvent content similar to that of Mtb-BirA structure (45.4%) solved at a resolution of 1.8 Å (PDB entry: 2cgh). The asymmetric unit for both hydrated crystal forms (2cgh and hMtb-BirA) includes two monomers in the asymmetric unit. Both the crystal structures are quite similar as indicated by the root-mean-square difference (rmsd) of 0.69 Å for 480 equivalent Cα atom pairs. The backbone structures of subunits A as superimposed with RAPIDO do not display any significant difference between the two structures either (Figure 2a). The Mtb-BirA molecule is composed of two domains; N-terminal domain 1 comprises of 7 β-strands (β1: 29–32, β2: 55–59, β3: 82–88, β4: 124–126, β5: 131–133, β6: 137–147 and β7: 150–158) and 6 α-helices (α1: 13–20, α2: 39–48, α3: 95–114, α4: 173–176, α5: 183–203, α6: 206–215), while C-terminal domain 2 is a SH3 domain with 5 strands forming an antiparallel β-sheet (β8: 220–227, β9: 231–240, β10: 246–250, β11: 253–257 and β12: 261–264). The major loops (Figure 3) in domain 1 are: L1 (21–28), L2 (33–38), L3 (49–54), L4 (60–81), L5 (89–94), L6 (115–123), L7 (127–130), L8 (159–172) & L9 (177–182) and in domain 2 are: L11 (228–230), L12 (241–245), L13 (251–252) & L14 (258–260).

On one occasion one tracer was infused via a leg vein and the other via mesenteric infusion catheters, and dogs were restudied with both tracers infused systemically. The ratios of systemically to portally infused tracers in portal and arterial plasma leucine were used as indexes of the radioactivity in the potential precursor pools and in fibrinogen-bound leucine as a paradigm of hepatic protein synthesis. In the dogs given leucine tracers, the relative proportions of systemically to portally infused radioactivity in portal free leucine (0.50 +/- 0.06) were lower (P less than 0.001) than in arterial free leucine (1.22 +/- 0.03) and not different from that bound in fibrinogen (0.43 +/- 0.02). In the dogs infused intraportally with KIC, these values were 0.81 +/- 0.04, 0.97 +/- 0.05, and 0.74 +/- 0.05, respectively. In the control studies these ratios were not significantly different from the expected value of 1.0. The results suggest that, in postabsorptive dogs, fibrinogen is exclusively synthesized from portally delivered leucine with little or no contribution from the hepatic artery, whereas portally delivered KIC contributes little directly to fibrinogen synthesis.

Molecular dynamic simulations suggested that water molecules permeate freely through the central and side channel pores.

20350262,"Population-based strategies for Helicobacter pylori-associated disease management: a Japanese perspective. THE PREVALENCE OF H. PYLORI INFECTION IN JAPAN. The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection ranges widely between developed and developing countries. In developing regions, such as India, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Africa, the infection rate is high and approximately 80% of the population is infected by this bacterium by 20 years of age [1]. By contrast, the infection rate is as low as 10–20% in developed countries, and increases at a rate of approximately 1% per year [2]. It is supposed that the state of environmental hygiene, such as the development of a modern water and sewage system, is related to the H. pylori infection rate. In Japan, the prevalence of H. pylori infection is also believed to be related to social environment, especially during childhood [3]. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in Japan is very low in children under 10 years old (~5%) and it increases with age [4]. Interestingly, the younger generation have a similar pattern to that seen in developed countries, with low prevalence of H. pylori infection; whereas the older generation has the pattern seen in developing countries, with high prevalence. In 1992, Asaka et al. evaluated the prevalence of H. pylori infection among Japanese individuals undergoing an annual medical check-up (n = 426) and reported that prevelance increased with age [4] (Figure 1). The authors showed that H. pylori infection rates gradually increased up to 39 years of age (e.g., approximately 5% in patients 0–9 years old, 20% in those 10–19 years old, 25% in those 20–29 years old and 40% in those 30–39 years old); whereas the rate was dramatically higher (i.e., ≥70%) at 40 years of age and over. Overall, they concluded that the infection rate was higher among individuals born before 1950 and lower in those born thereafter. There was a rapid change in sanitary conditions and standard of living in Japan after World War II, and clean public water systems were introduced in Japan in the 1950s. This provided us with some evidence that H. pylori infection may be influenced by sanitary conditions. In our preliminary experiment, we also examined the prevalence of H. pylori infection using the urine antibody test (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) [5] for 4331 first-visited patients in Oita University hospital, Japan, between 2002 and 2006 (Figure 1). As expected, the prevalence of H. pylori infection increased with age. In our study, 10 years had passed since the report by Asaka et al.; therefore, as expected, when their results were simply shifted by 10 years, our results were in close agreement with theirs for those under 40 years old. However, they reported that the prevalence in patients aged over 40 years of age was over 70%; whereas we found a prevalence of 60% in patients aged over 50 years. There are several possibilities that may explain the discrepancies. For example, the H. pylori detection methods were different (i.e., they used serum antibody ELISA). Moreover, they chose a cutoff optimal density by themselves, which might have caused the high positive rate. Interestingly, Kumagai et al. reported that the H. pylori infection rate in those aged 9–70 years old decreased by 20% from 1986 to 1994 [6]. As the same population was examined longitudinally, a decrease in the prevalence was observed in every age group. The fall in the prevalence that occurred during the observation period reflected not only the changes in the rate of acquisition of H. pylori in childhood but also the higher rate of loss of the infection. This disappearance of H. pylori was thought to possibly be due to the use of anti microbials for other common infections. Thus, the H. pylori infection rate in Japan will probably continue to fall owing to the improvement of sanitary conditions and the use of antibiotics in the future. THE BACKGROUND FOR THE GUIDELINES IN 2009. In Japan, the first guidelines for management of H. pylori infection were constructed in 2000 [7,8] (Table 1). These aimed to prepare clinicians for the task ahead in view of H. pylori eradication therapy becoming available. Gastric and/or duodenal ulcer were the only diseases for which H. pylori eradication therapy was recommended. Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma was recommended to receive eradication therapy only at specialist institutions where satisfactory histopathologic diagnosis, endoscopic diagnosis (including endoscopic ultrasound) and genetic analysis can be performed, and where close follow-up is available. The second guidelines in 2003 advanced the field greatly [9,10]. As the indication for cure of H. pylori infection, MALT lymphoma was recommended to receive eradication therapy in addition to active gastric and/or duodenal ulcer. In addition, the following three clinical outcomes were upgraded to advisable indications; early gastric cancer after endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR); atrophic gastritis; and gastric hyperplastic polyp. Thus, the 2003 guidelines included evidence-based recommendations for indication, diagnosis and therapy. The guidelines were revised dramatically again in January 2009, 6 years after the second revision [11]. This revision was based on the approval of the Japanese national health insurance system for second-line eradication, the evidence for the relationship between H. pylori and gastric cancer and also the relationship with various extragastric diseases. The results from a large-scale multicenter study in Japan published in 2008 helped the revision grately [12]. In the study, patients with early gastric cancer who received EMR were divided randomly into the eradication treatment group and the noneradication control group, and the development of metachronous recurrence was followed-up for 3 years. As a result, metachronous recurrence was significantly inhibited in the eradication group. That study clearly showed that the cure of H. pylori infection led to a decrease in the development of gastric cancer.

20351248,"Protein folding at the membrane interface, the structure of Nogo-66 requires interactions with a phosphocholine surface. Repair of damage to the central nervous system (CNS) is inhibited by the presence of myelin proteins that prevent axonal regrowth. Consequently, growth inhibitors and their common receptor have been identified as targets in the treatment of injury to the CNS. Here we describe the structure of the extracellular domain of the neurite outgrowth inhibitor (Nogo) in a membrane-like environment. Isoforms of Nogo are expressed with a common C terminus containing two transmembrane (TM) helices. The ectodomain between the two TM helices, Nogo-66, is active in preventing axonal growth [GrandPre T, Nakamura F, Vartanian T, Strittmatter SM (2000) Nature 403:439-444]. We studied the structure of Nogo-66 alone and in the presence of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) vesicles and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles as membrane mimetics. We find that Nogo-66 is largely disordered when free in solution. However, when bound to a phosphocholine surface Nogo-66 adopts a unique, stable fold, even in the absence of TM anchors. Using paramagnetic probes and protein-DPC nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs), we define portions of the growth inhibitor likely to be accessible on the cell surface. With these data we predict that residues (28-58) are available to bind the Nogo receptor, which is entirely consistent with functional assays. Moreover, the conformations and relative positions of side chains recognized by the receptor are now defined and provide a foundation for antagonist design.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2338,pos_MEDLINE,0.998103,1
20367259,"Import, maturation, and function of SOD1 and its copper chaperone CCS in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Cu, Zn, superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is a ubiquitous enzyme localized in multiple cellular compartments, including mitochondria, where it concentrates in the intermembrane space (IMS). Similar to other small IMS proteins, the import and retention of SOD1 in the IMS is linked to its folding and maturation, involving the formation of critical intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds. Therefore, the cysteine residues of SOD1 play a fundamental role in its IMS localization. IMS import of SOD1 involves its copper chaperone, CCS, whose mitochondrial distribution is regulated by the Mia40/Erv1 disulfide relay system in a redox-dependent manner: CCS promotes SOD1 maturation and retention in the IMS. The function of SOD1 in the IMS is still unknown, but it is plausible that it serves to remove superoxide released from the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mutations in SOD1 cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), whose pathologic features include mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction. Mutant SOD1 localization in the IMS is not dictated by oxygen concentration and the Mia40/Erv1 system, but is primarily dependent on aberrant protein folding and aggregation.

20371520,"Insights into the mechanism of Rad51 recombinase from the structure and properties of a filament interface mutant. INTRODUCTION. Homologous recombination (HR) is essential for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks and for the maintenance of genomic stability. HR also provides a key mechanism for the generation of genetic diversity. In eukaryotes, the central steps of HR require the ATP-dependent DNA strand exchange activity of Rad51 protein, which is a member of the highly conserved RecA recombinase family (1). DNA strand exchange reactions occur between homologous molecules of single- and double-stranded DNA. The first step of DNA strand exchange is the formation of a competent presynaptic filament of Rad51 protein on single-stranded DNA. Filament assembly allosterically activates the enzymatic activities of Rad51 including ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis, homology search and DNA strand exchange. The proper assembly and activation of Rad51–ssDNA filaments are critical for DSB repair and cancer avoidance, as illustrated by defects in this process that are associated with cancer predisposition syndromes in humans (2). Presynaptic filament assembly, turnover and DNA strand exchange activity are coupled to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP by Rad51. Therefore signaling between binding sites for DNA and nucleotide ligands is critical for Rad51 recombination activity. It is known that ATP induces or stabilizes a high-affinity ssDNA-binding conformation of Rad51 that is required for the assembly of catalytically competent presynaptic filaments (3). The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP weakens Rad51–DNA interactions, facilitating filament turnover. In the RecA/Rad51 family, high-affinity binding to ssDNA in the presence of ATP or of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs correlates with a high-pitch filament morphology detected by electron microscopy and crystallographic methods (4,5). The high-pitch filament is generally referred to as the active form of the filament. Low-affinity binding to ssDNA in the presence of ADP or no nucleotide correlates with a low-pitch filament morphology that is generally referred to as the inactive form of the filament. The mechanism of inter-conversion between these forms, if it occurs during recombination, is unknown. The assembly of Rad51 filaments on ssDNA is modulated by RPA, the eukaryotic ssDNA-binding protein. RPA promotes filament assembly by removing regions of secondary structure from ssDNA that would otherwise impede Rad51 binding, but the high affinity of RPA for ssDNA imposes a potential barrier to Rad51 filament assembly in vitro (6,7). Biochemical data demonstrate that to form a competent presynaptic filament, Rad51 must displace RPA in order to bind to sites on ssDNA. In vitro, strand exchange occurs optimally when Rad51 is pre-incubated with ssDNA and ATP prior to RPA addition. When the ssDNA is pre-saturated with RPA, however, as is likely to occur in vivo, strand exchange is inhibited due to the rate-limiting displacement of RPA from ssDNA by Rad51. The inhibition is reversed by recombination mediator proteins (Rad52, Rad51 paralogs, or Brca2) that promote RPA displacement by Rad51 (2,8). The importance of Rad51/RPA competition in recombination is illustrated by the observation that recombination-deficient mutations in yeast recombination mediator proteins Rad55 and Rad57 are complemented by mutations in Rad51 that increase its ssDNA-binding affinity and therefore its ability to compete with RPA for binding sites on ssDNA (9). The coupling of ssDNA binding to catalysis is of central importance in the recombination activities of all Rad51/RecA enzymes, but the mechanism of signaling between the various DNA-bound states and catalytic sites is poorly understood. This signaling to and from the active site is coordinated by loops L1 and L2, which are disordered in recombinase structures lacking DNA, but ordered in RecA–DNA structures (4). Major ssDNA binding determinants occur in L2, which is connected at its N-terminal end to a conserved glutamine residue (Gln194 in Escherichia coli RecA, Gln326 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51) that is proposed to act as a sensor for the presence of ATP in the active site (10). Other interactions that span the protomer–protomer interface are proposed to play key roles in coordinating DNA binding to the activation of catalysis. Crystal structures of high-pitch filaments show that the ATPase active site itself spans the protomer–protomer interface (4,11). In the RecA–DNA structures, Lys248 and Lys250 from one protomer coordinate the γ-phosphate of ATP bound to the P-loop region of the adjacent protomer, with Lys250 interacting with the putative catalytic glutamate residue of the adjacent protomer (4). These interactions are proposed to stabilize the interface and activate hydrolysis in response to DNA binding (4). This mechanism is unlikely to be conserved outside of the eubacteria, however, since the sequence and structural motifs containing the two lysine residues are missing from eukaryotic Rad51 and archaeal RadA enzymes. To date only one structure of a eukaryotic Rad51 filament has been published. The S. cerevisiae Rad51 I345T mutant is a gain-of-function mutant with enhanced ssDNA-binding affinity (9). The crystallographic structure of I345T revealed a filament with P31 symmetry (11). An interesting feature of the I354T structure is that the repeating unit is a dimer, so that alternating momomers are in different conformations, creating two classes of interfaces and thus two classes of ATPase active sites. The I354T structure shows that residue His352, which is highly conserved among Rad51, Dmc1 and RadA recombinases, occupies an important position at the protomer–protomer interface near the ATPase site. The equivalent residue in E. coli RecA is Phe217, which is known to be important for allosteric communication within RecA–ssDNA filaments (12). In yeast Rad51 filaments, His352 interacts with P-loop/Walker A residue Phe187 from the adjacent protomer.

20377183,"Elimination of the native structure and solubility of the hVAPB MSP domain by the Pro56Ser mutation that causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The Pro56Ser mutation in the human VAPB MSP domain causes a familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here we present the first structural investigation of both wild-type and Pro56Ser mutant MSP domains. The results reveal that the wild-type MSP domain is well-folded at neutral pH but can undergo acid-induced unfolding reversibly. It has a thermodynamic stability energy (DeltaG degrees (N-U)) of 7.40 kcal/mol and is also active in binding to a Nir2 peptide with a K(D) of 0.65 muM. Further determination of its crystal structure reveals that it adopts a seven-strand immunoglobulin-like beta sandwich in which Pro56 adopts the unusual cis-peptide bond conformation that appears to be critical in maintaining the characteristic S-shaped loop. Markedly, the Pro56Ser mutation renders the MSP domain insoluble in buffer. Nevertheless, as facilitated by our recent discovery that ""insoluble proteins"" can be solubilized in salt-free water, we have successfully characterized the residue-specific conformation of the Pro56Ser mutant by CD and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The Pro56Ser mutant remains lacking of the native tight packing and secondary structures under various conditions and was further characterized as having a non-native helical conformation weakly populated at pH 3.5. Intriguingly, Pro12 located in another S-shaped loop also adopts the cis-peptide bond conformation, and its mutation to Ser is able to make the MSP domain highly insoluble and unfolded like the Pro56Ser mutant.

RESULTS Although HIV/AIDS mortality rates decreased once HAART became available, the declines were not uniformly distributed among population groups. The associations between SES and HIV/AIDS mortality and between race and HIV/AIDS mortality, although present in the pre-HAART period, were significantly greater in the peri- and post-HAART periods, with higher SES and White race associated with the greatest declines in mortality during the post-HAART period. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the fundamental cause hypothesis, as the introduction of a life-extending treatment exacerbated inequalities in HIV/AIDS mortality by SES and by race. In addition to a strong focus on factors that improve overall population health, more effective public health interventions and policies would facilitate an equitable distribution of health-enhancing innovations.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,2357,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0022916892,0
20444480,"The structure of adeno-associated virus serotype 3B (AAV-3B): insights into receptor binding and immune evasion. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) have emerged as leading gene therapy candidate vectors. Cited advantages include lack of disease associated with the virus, the ability to transduce non-dividing cells, absence of an adverse immunological response, and long-term expression of therapeutic payload (Buning, Braun-Falco, and Hallek, 2004; Raake et al., 2008). Despite these attributes, AAVs have broad cell and tissue tropism, low transduction efficiency, and are neutralized by a pre-sensitized host immune system (Halbert et al., 1997), limiting the therapeutic potential of vectors based on natural serotypes. Improved AAV-based vectors can be designed more efficiently with an understanding of the structure and functions of natural virus capsids. Adeno-associated viruses are small (~250Å) non-enveloped parvoviruses with a 4.7kb single-stranded DNA genome packaged inside a protein capsid of T=1 icosahedral (60-fold) symmetry (Chapman and Agbandje-McKenna, 2006). Parvoviruses of the genus Dependovirus, such as AAV, depend in replication upon co-infection with a helper virus, such as adenovirus (Bowles, Rabinowitz, and Samulski, 2006). The AAV genome contains two genes, encoding capsid and replication proteins. Multiple start codons and alternate mRNA splicing give rise to 3 overlapping capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3). Capsid proteins differ only at their N-termini and are present in a 1:1:8 ratio. VP1 contains a unique N-terminal region of ~137 amino acids, followed by a 65 amino acid region, common to VP1 and VP2. The VP3 protein contains ~534 amino acids (depending on the serotype), common to all 3 capsid proteins. 12 AAV serotypes (and hundreds of natural variants thereof) have been identified (Gao et al., 2004; Schmidt et al., 2008). In spite of the high sequence identity of their genomes (53–93%), AAV serotypes are antigenically distinct from one another and use a range of different receptors for cell binding and entry (Akache et al., 2006; Asokan et al., 2006; Qing et al., 1999; Rutledge, Halbert, and Russell, 1998; Seiler et al., 2006; Summerford, Bartlett, and Samulski, 1999; Summerford and Samulski, 1998), which contribute to widely different cell specificities among serotypes. AAV serotype 3 was isolated from a human clinical specimen (Muramatsu et al., 1996) and has somewhat different cell tropism compared to other serotypes (Handa et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2005; Rabinowitz et al., 2002). AAV-3B is a minor variant of AAV-3 (also known as AAV-3A), with 6 amino acid differences in the VP1 capsid protein (Rutledge, Halbert, and Russell, 1998), 4 of which are in VP3. Cell entry by AAV-3B is not inhibited by neutralizing rabbit anti-AAV-2 serum, demonstrating that these 2 serotypes are antigenically distinct (Rutledge, Halbert, and Russell, 1998). Although anti-AAV-2 serum does not efficiently neutralize AAV-3 cell entry, some conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies raised against the AAV-2 capsid are cross-reactive with AAV-3 (Wobus et al., 2000). This suggests structural conservation of some epitopes on the two capsids. Other monoclonal antibodies (such as C37-B) specifically inhibit receptor binding by AAV-2, and are not cross-reactive with other serotypes (Wobus et al., 2000). The effect of structural differences on antibody cross-reactivity among AAV serotypes is not fully understood. In spite of high sequence identity between some of the AAV serotypes, there are important functional differences beyond their antigenic properties. Comparative studies therefore have the potential to shed important light on, for example, the determinants of cell tropism / specificity. AAV-3B is most closely related in sequence to AAV-2, sharing 87% capsid identity to the type species. AAV-2 is the most widely characterized serotype, and its crystal structure was the first to be determined among AAVs (Xie et al., 2002). Subsequently, crystal structures of AAV-4 (Govindasamy et al., 2006) and -8 (Nam et al., 2007) and a cryo-EM structure of AAV-5 (Walters et al., 2004) have been determined. Crystal structures of serotypes 1, 5–7, and 9 are also in progress (DiMattia et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2006; Mitchell et al., 2009; Quesada et al., 2007; Xie et al., 2008). All serotypes have a core β-barrel subunit fold, which is highly conserved among all parvoviruses of known structure (Chapman and Agbandje-McKenna, 2006). The AAV capsid surface topology arises from loops that connect the core beta strands of each subunit, generating distinctive features including protruding spikes surrounding the 3-fold symmetry axis; a cylindrical protrusion surrounding the pore near the 5-fold symmetry axis; and a dimple near the 2-fold symmetry axis. Differences in the intervening loops of AAV-2, -4, and -8 lead to unique capsid structural features, which presumably contribute to serotype-specific receptor interactions, immune recognition, cell tropism and transduction efficiency. AAV-2 and -3 require heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) for cell attachment (Handa et al., 2000; Rabinowitz et al., 2002; Summerford and Samulski, 1998), while serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6 bind to specific sialic acid derivatives prior to cell entry (Kaludov et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2006). AAV-6 can also bind heparan sulfate, but it is sialic acid binding that facilitates cell entry. AAV-3 has a weaker affinity for heparin than AAV-2, as higher concentrations of heparin are required to inhibit cell entry (Handa et al., 2000). This is due, presumably, to incomplete conservation of the heparin binding site identified on AAV-2 (Kern et al., 2003; Levy et al., 2009; Lochrie et al., 2006; O'Donnell, Taylor, and Chapman, 2009; Opie et al., 2003). Following attachment to HSPG, AAV-3 then binds to a co-receptor before entering the cell through an endosomal pathway. FGFR1 and the 37/67kDa laminin receptor (LamR) have been identified as co-receptors for both AAV-2 and AAV-3 (Akache et al., 2006; Belur et al., 2008; Blackburn, Steadman, and Johnson, 2006; Qing et",PMC,pos,1,pos,2375,pos_PMC,0.9962346,1
20478354,"Phenyl- and benzylurea cytokinins as competitive inhibitors of cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase: a structural study. Cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKO) is a flavoenzyme, which irreversibly degrades the plant hormones cytokinins and thereby participates in their homeostasis. Several synthetic cytokinins including urea derivatives are known CKO inhibitors but structural data explaining enzyme-inhibitor interactions are lacking. Thus, an inhibitory study with numerous urea derivatives was undertaken using the maize enzyme (ZmCKO1) and the crystal structure of ZmCKO1 in a complex with N-(2-chloro-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-phenylurea (CPPU) was solved. CPPU binds in a planar conformation and competes for the same binding site with natural substrates like N(6)-(2-isopentenyl)adenine (iP) and zeatin (Z). Nitrogens at the urea backbone are hydrogen bonded to the putative active site base Asp169. Subsequently, site-directed mutagenesis of L492 and E381 residues involved in the inhibitor binding was performed. The crystal structures of L492A mutant in a complex with CPPU and N-(2-chloro-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-benzylurea (CPBU) were solved and confirm the importance of a stacking interaction between the 2-chloro-4-pyridinyl ring of the inhibitor and the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD cofactor. Amino derivatives like N-(2-amino-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-phenylurea (APPU) inhibited ZmCKO1 more efficiently than CPPU, as opposed to the inhibition of E381A/S mutants, emphasizing the importance of this residue for inhibitor binding. As highly specific CKO inhibitors without undesired side effects are of major interest for physiological studies, all studied compounds were further analyzed for cytokinin activity in the Amaranthus bioassay and for binding to the Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors AHK3 and AHK4. By contrast to CPPU itself, APPU and several benzylureas bind only negligibly to the receptors and exhibit weak cytokinin activity.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2388,pos_MEDLINE,0.99683964,1
20479275,"Insights into the recruitment of the NMD machinery from the crystal structure of a core EJC-UPF3b complex. In mammals, Up-frameshift proteins (UPFs) form a surveillance complex that interacts with the exon junction complex (EJC) to elicit nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). UPF3b is the component of the surveillance complex that bridges the interaction with the EJC. Here, we report the 3.4 A resolution crystal structure of a minimal UPF3b-EJC assembly, consisting of the interacting domains of five proteins (UPF3b, MAGO, Y14, eIF4AIII, and Barentsz) together with RNA and adenylyl-imidodiphosphate. Human UPF3b binds with the C-terminal domain stretched over a composite surface formed by eIF4AIII, MAGO, and Y14. Residues that affect NMD when mutated are found at the core interacting surfaces, whereas differences between UPF3b and UPF3a map at peripheral interacting residues. Comparison with the binding mode of the protein PYM underscores how a common molecular surface of MAGO and Y14 recognizes different proteins acting at different times in the same pathway. The binding mode to eIF4AIII identifies a surface hot spot that is used by different DEAD-box proteins to recruit their regulators.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2389,pos_MEDLINE,0.99788433,1
20593814,"Structure of the human sulfhydryl oxidase augmenter of liver regeneration and characterization of a human mutation causing an autosomal recessive myopathy . Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR1; also abbreviated as GFER, HPO and HSS) is a representative of a group of small sulfhydryl oxidases whose founding member, Erv1p, was first recognized as a protein essential for respiration and vegetative growth in yeast (1, 2). Since that time a number of Erv/ALR family members have been characterized including yeast Erv2p and ALR analogs from certain double-stranded DNA viruses, and from plants and animals (3). These proteins share a common flavin binding fold in which the isoalloxazine ring is inserted into the mouth of a bundle of four helices (3). This novel flavin binding mode, first recognized for yeast Erv2p (4), and then for rat ALR (5) and yeast Ero1p (6), is found in all of the well-characterized sulfhydryl oxidases including the larger multidomain Quiescin-sulfhydryl oxidase (QSOX) enzymes (7–10). Mammalian ALR is a covalent homodimer and is found in two splice variants (11–16). The short form (sfALR, 15 kDa; starting at M81 of the human long form, lfALR, sequence depicted in Figure 1A) is a circulating growth factor (11, 12, 15, 17, 18) and interacts with specific receptors on the cell surface (19, 20). Receptors for sfALR stimulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade leading to enhanced liver regeneration (19, 21) and recovery of renal tubular cells from ischemic/reperfusion injury (22). sfALR is also found in the cytosol and in the nucleus and interacts with Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19kDa interacting protein 2-like (23) that confers protection against the effects of viral infection and proapoptotic stimuli (24). sfALR also binds to Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 of the mammalian COP9 signalosome (25). While interest in sfALR is increasing, specific details concerning its enzymatic activity, locale, and mode of action remain unclear. Long form ALR (23 kDa), like its yeast counterpart, Erv1p, populates the intermembrane space (IMS) of the mitochondrion, where it participates in a chain of disulfide exchange reactions that generate disulfide bonds in a number of resident proteins with twin Cx3C and Cx9C motifs (26–37) (Figure 1B). ALR is currently classified as a flavoprotein oxidase catalyzing the generation of disulfides with the following stoichiometry: However, cytochrome c is a much better electron acceptor than oxygen for both sf- and lfALR in vitro (38, 39) This finding led us to suggest that reduction of cytochrome c could minimize the generation of reactive oxygen species associated with generation of disulfides in the IMS (Figure 1B, (38)). Subsequent in vivo studies of the yeast mitochondrial IMS have confirmed that Erv1p and cytochrome c can interact productively during oxidative folding (37, 40). Alternatively, any hydrogen peroxide liberated from these flavoprotein sulfhydryl oxidases could reoxidize cytochrome c catalyzed by cytochrome c peroxidase within the IMS (41). In an interesting recent communication, Comi and colleagues (42) describe the first human ALR mutation to be recognized. Three children from consanguineous parents developed cataract, progressive muscle hypotonia with developmental delay, and hearing loss. Di Fonzo et al. identified the missense mutation which results in the substitution of an arginine for a histidine at position 194 (42). While this R194H mutation did not affect the levels of mRNA, it appeared to impact the import and/or stability of the mutant protein in the mitochondrial IMS. Primary myoblasts from an affected sibling showed an approximately 2-fold increase in doubling time, again consistent with a significant impact of the mutant on cell function (42). Di Fonzo et al. further sought to characterize the mutant by generating the analogous mutation (R182H) in yeast Erv1p. In this background, the mutation significantly impacted cytochrome oxidase biosynthesis because Erv1p is involved in the folding of the copper chaperones required for metal insertion into this respiratory chain component (43). However the focus of their study was neither an enzymological characterization of the human mutant nor a discussion of the molecular environment of R194 and the interactions it might make with neighboring residues. Herein we characterize the R194H mutation in the context of our continuing enzymological studies of human ALR (38, 39, 44). While the yeast Erv1p analog of ALR proved a useful starting point for evaluation of the behavior of the R194H mutation (42), there are significant differences between the yeast and mammalian orthologs. For example, the distal CxxC disulfide responsible for shuttling reducing equivalents from Mia40 to the proximal disulfide that is in redox communication with the flavin is placed some 40 residues distant in the primary structure of the two proteins (Figure 1A) (3, 39, 45). Further, an initial examination of the location of R194 using the published structure of rat ALR (PDB: 1OQC, (5)) suggests that it is placed close to an interchain disulfide bond in the mammalian proteins and is involved in H-bonding interactions across the subunit interface (see later). Not only does Erv1p lack these interchain disulfides, but there are further significant differences between the sequences of yeast and mammalian orthologs in the vicinity of R194 (Figure 1A). It is therefore important to assess the impact of the R194H mutation with the cognate human protein. Since a structure of human ALR was unavailable, we have determined a high resolution crystal structure of the short form ALR, intending to pair this with a companion structure of the R194H mutant. Although we have been unsuccessful in obtaining crystals of the R194H mutant, we have utilized 2D NMR methods to document a marked increase in protein mobility compared to the corresponding wild type protein. While the mutant flavoprotein remains fully active in a variety of assays, the resulting protein appears less stable, prone to loss of FAD cofactor, susceptible to reduction of its intersubunit disulfide bonds, and se",PMC,pos,1,pos,2415,pos_PMC,0.9975177,1
20595394,"Quantitative characterization of Tob interactions provides the thermodynamic basis for translation termination-coupled deadenylase regulation. Translation termination-coupled deadenylation is the first and often the rate-limiting step of eukaryotic mRNA decay in which two deadenylases, Ccr4-Caf1 and Pan2, play key roles. One of the deadenylases, Caf1, associates with Tob, which recruits Caf1 to the poly(A) tail through interactions with a cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABPC1). We previously proposed that the competition between Tob and eRF3 (a translation termination factor that interacts with PABPC1) is responsible for the regulation of deadenylase activity. However, the molecular mechanism of the regulation should be addressed by investigating the binding affinity and the cellular levels of these proteins. In this work, we characterized the human Tob interactions with Caf1 and a C-terminal domain of PABPC1 (PABC). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Western blot analyses revealed that Tob consists of a structured N-terminal BTG-Tob domain and an unstructured C-terminal region with two conserved PAM2 (PABPC1-interacting motif 2) motifs. The BTG-TOB domain associates with Caf1, whereas the C-terminal PAM2 motif binds to PABC, with a K(d) value of 20 microM. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the levels of eRF3 and Tob in HeLa cells are 4-5 microM and less than 0.2 microM, respectively. On the basis of these results, we propose a thermodynamic mechanism for the translation termination-coupled deadenylation mediated by the Tob-Caf1 complex.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2417,pos_MEDLINE,0.99279517,1
20599753,"Crystal structure of human gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase. Gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase (GBBH) is a 2-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase that catalyzes the biosynthesis of l-carnitine by hydroxylation of gamma-butyrobetaine (GBB). l-carnitine is required for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for generating metabolic energy. The only known synthetic inhibitor of GBBH is mildronate (3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium) propionate dihydrate), which is a non-hydroxylatable analog of GBB. To aid in the discovery of novel GBBH inhibitors by rational drug design, we have solved the three-dimensional structure of recombinant human GBBH at 2.0A resolution. The GBBH monomer consists of a catalytic double-stranded beta-helix (DBSH) domain, which is found in all 2KG oxygenases, and a smaller N-terminal domain. Extensive interactions between two monomers confirm earlier observations that GBBH is dimeric in its biological state. Although many 2KG oxygenases are multimeric, the dimerization interface of GBBH is very different from that of related enzymes. The N-terminal domain of GBBH has a similar fold to the DUF971 superfamily, which consists of several short bacterial proteins with unknown function. The N-terminal domain has a bound Zn ion, which is coordinated by three cysteines and one histidine. Although several other 2KG oxygenases with known structures have more than one domain, none of them resemble the N-terminal domain of GBBH. The N-terminal domain may facilitate dimer formation, but its precise biological role remains to be discovered.

Electron transfer (ET) between the large membrane-integral redox complexes in the terminal part of the respiratory chain is mediated either by a soluble c-type cytochrome, as in mitochondria, or by a membrane-anchored cytochrome c, as described for the ET chain of the bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans. Here, the structure of cytochrome c(552) from P. denitrificans with the linker segment that attaches the globular domain to the membrane anchor is presented. Cytochrome c(552) including the linker segment was crystallized and its structure was determined by molecular replacement. The structural features provide functionally important information. The prediction of the flexibility of the linker region [Berry & Trumpower (1985), J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2458-2467] was confirmed by our crystal structure. The N-terminal region from residues 13 to 31 is characterized by poor electron density, which is compatible with high mobility of this region. This result indicates that this region is highly flexible, which is functionally important for this protein to shuttle electrons between complexes III and IV in the respiratory chain. Zinc present in the crystallization buffer played a key role in the successful crystallization of this protein.

20637181,"A mitochondrial late embryogenesis abundant protein stabilizes model membranes in the dry state. Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are a highly diverse group of polypeptides expected to play important roles in desiccation tolerance of plant seeds. They are also found in other plant tissues and in some anhydrobotic invertebrates, fungi, protists and prokaryotes. The LEA protein LEAM accumulates in the matrix space of pea (Pisum sativum) mitochondria during late seed maturation. LEAM is an intrinsically disordered protein folding into amphipathic alpha-helix upon desiccation. This suggests that it could interact with the inner mitochondrial membrane, providing structural protection in dry seeds. Here, we have used Fourier-transform infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy to gain insight into the molecular details of interactions of LEAM with phospholipid bilayers in the dry state and their effects on liposome stability. LEAM interacted specifically with negatively charged phosphate groups in dry phospholipids, increasing fatty acyl chain mobility. This led to an enhanced stability of liposomes during drying and rehydration, but also upon freezing. Protection depended on phospholipid composition and was strongly enhanced in membranes containing the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin. Collectively, the results provide strong evidence for a function of LEAM as a mitochondrial membrane protectant during desiccation and highlight the role of lipid composition in the interactions between LEA proteins and membranes.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2432,pos_MEDLINE,0.99554896,1

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a precursor form of aminopeptidase I (prApe1) and α-mannosidase (Ams1) are selectively transported to the vacuole through the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway under vegetative conditions and through autophagy under starvation conditions. Atg19 plays a central role in these processes by linking Ams1 and prApe1 to Atg8 and Atg11. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of cargo recognition by Atg19. Here, we report structural and functional analyses of Atg19 and its paralog, Atg34. A protease-resistant domain was identified in the C-terminal region of Atg19, which was also conserved in Atg34. In vitro pulldown assays showed that the C-terminal domains of both Atg19 and Atg34 are responsible for Ams1 binding; these domains are hereafter referred to as Ams1-binding domains (ABDs). The transport of Ams1, but not prApe1, was blocked in atg19Δatg34Δ cells expressing Atg19(ΔABD), indicating that ABD is specifically required for Ams1 transport. We then determined the solution structures of the ABDs of Atg19 and Atg34 using NMR spectroscopy.

20676100,"Hybrid molecular structure of the giant protease tripeptidyl peptidase II. Giant proteases are homo–multimeric assemblies of extraordinary size which act downstream of the proteasome. Moreover, they are capable of substituting for some of the proteasome’s metabolic functions1. The archetypal giant protease is tricorn protease, which was originally found in the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum2,3. Its 121 kDa subunits form hexamers4, which can assemble further into icosahedral capsids with a mass of 14.5 MDa5. The functional equivalent of tricorn protease in eukaryotic cells is TPP II, a large spindle–shaped complex with a molecular weight of ~ 6 MDa. TPP II is a serine protease of the subtilisin class with an exopeptidase activity that cleaves off tripeptides from the N–termini of peptides such as those released by the proteasome. In addition to exopeptidase activity, TPP II also has endopeptidase activity, but this activity is more than two orders of magnitude lower6. TPP II has been implicated in the trimming of proteasomal degradation products for MHC class I antigen presentation7,8, however, the precise role of TPP II in antigen processing is still a matter of some controversy.9,10,11. TPP II is upregulated in diseases that involve increased and uncontrolled proteolysis12,13. TPP II knockout mice are viable but have a shortened life span, which is associated with the activation of cell death programs and an immunosenescence–like phenotype14. A membrane–associated variant of TPP II degrades the endogenous satiety agent cholecystokinin–8 (CCK–8)15 involved in fat metabolism, which makes TPP II an interesting target for the treatment of obesity16. Bioinformatic as well as biochemical studies indicated that TPP II contains a subtilisin–like domain, but the functional role of the larger part of the polypeptide chain remained enigmatic. Earlier single–particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo–EM) investigations had shown that the overall structure of TPP II is a spindle–shaped assembly composed of two twisted strands; each strand contains 10 repeat segments (dimers) in which the two monomers are oriented back–to–back17. Functional studies had shown that TPP II dimers have only nominal activity (which we refer to here as being in an inactive state) and the specific activity of TPP II increases with the number of assembled dimers; this is indicative of a contact–induced activation mechanism18. For a mechanistic understanding of TPP II and its unique architecture, a high–resolution structure of the fully assembled complex is indispensable. Since the structure of TPP II is highly dynamic in vitro – the strand length is dependent on protein concentration giving rise to polymorphism18 – its crystallization has remained an elusive goal. To overcome this problem, we have used the following strategy: we dissociated the multimeric spindles into dimers and treated them such that re-association was inhibited. To this end, many modifications (fusions, deletions, site–directed mutagenesis and chemical modifications) were tried – without success. We found that the detergent octylglucoside (OG) could stabilize the dimers obtained from the dissociated spindles and prevent their reassociation upon concentration. TPP II dimers prepared in this way were suitable for crystallization trials and led to the production of well–ordered crystals. Having crystals of TPP II dimers allowed us to apply a hybrid approach combining x–ray crystallography and single–particle cryo–EM, where the 3.2Å structure of the TPP II dimer was docked into an improved EM envelope (14Å resolution) of the TPP II spindle to generate a pseudo–atomic model of the TPP II holocomplex. This structure provides new insights into the functional mechanism of the intriguing supramolecular architecture of TPP II and the molecular basis for its assembly–dependent activation. RESULTS. OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE TPP II DIMER. Crystals of the TPP II dimers, grown in the presence of OG detergent, have the space group P41212 with one monomer per asymmetric unit. The electron density map determined by single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing of diffraction data collected at the selenium absorption peak was of good quality (Supplementary Fig. 1). Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Based on the crystal structure, the TPP II sequence can be divided into three parts (Fig. 1a): (i) The subtilisin–like domain, which between the catalytic Asp and His residues contains the long insert (~ 200 amino acids) typical for all TPP II homologues, (ii) a central domain rich in β–sheets, and (iii) a C–terminal domain comprising a twelve–helix bundle. The general shape of a monomer is that of a bottomless “bowl” with a curved protrusion (Fig. 1b). In the TPP II dimer, the monomers are oriented back–to–back; the opening at the bottom of each bowl is sealed off by the adjoining monomer, the protrusions of the two monomers come into contact to form the “handle” of a dimer (Fig. 1b). The protrusion is formed by the C–terminal region of the sequence and part of the insert within the subtilisin– like domain (Fig. 1a-c). The subtilisin–like domain encompasses only a small portion of the entire structure and is located at the rim of the bowl, which is otherwise formed primarily by the central domain. The structure of the subtilisin–like domain is quite similar to prototypical subtilisin – nearly all of the secondary structure elements are conserved. Nevertheless, some conspicuous differences between subtilisin and the TPP II subtilisin–like domain exist. They involve conformational differences of a number of loops that differ in both length and sequence, but are conserved in their respective family members. Most notable is the ~ 200 amino acid insertion (residues Gly75–Val266) (Fig. 1a), which is absent in subtilisin. This stretch of residues forms a supporting structure between the bowl and the curved protrusion; its helical region integrates into the twelve–helix bundle of the C–terminal domain (Fig. 1b,c).

The aim of this study was to verify the prevalence of physical inactivity and associated factors among adolescents commuting to school.

Adolescents were classified as ""inactive in commuting"" when they reported not commuting to school actively (e.g., walking or bicycling) and/or spent less than 20 minutes getting to and from school. 43% (95%CI: 41.5-44.5) of adolescents were physically inactive in commuting. Place of residence and maternal schooling were statistically associated with outcome (inactivity in commuting to school) (p<0.01). Among male adolescents, physical inactivity in commuting was significantly associated with age (p=0.02) and skin color (p=0.04). Inactivity in commuting was relatively common when compared to other studies.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,2445,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0023413405,0
20696396,"Molecular basis for the association of human E4B U box ubiquitin ligase with E2-conjugating enzymes UbcH5c and Ubc4. INTRODUCTION. The covalent modification of proteins with ubiquitin or polyubiquitin chains regulates many cellular processes including protein degradation, cellular trafficking, DNA repair and DNA lesion bypass (Weissman, 2001; Passmore and Barford, 2004; Pickart and Eddins, 2004). Ubiquitylation involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions (Pickart, 2001) where ubiquitin is transferred from an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme forming a thioester conjugate with a cysteine of E2. E2 associates with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which recognizes a protein substrate and facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to the ζ-amino group of a lysine residue in the substrate (Ye and Rape, 2009). In some instances, a chain elongation factor E4 catalyzes polyubiquitin chain assembly in place of or after E3 ubiquitylation (Kuhlbrodt et al., 2005). There are three classes of E3 ubiquitin ligases defined by the presence of a HECT, RING or U-box domain. The RING and U-box domain have the same fold but unlike the RING domain the U-box does not coordinate Zn2+ ions (Aravind and Koonin, 2000; Ohi et al., 2003). HECT E3s form a catalytic ubiquitin thioester intermediate before transferring ubiquitin to an acceptor protein (Huang et al., 1999) whereas RING and U-box E3s function as adaptors that bring in close proximity the ubiquitin-linked E2 and a target protein, with the RING or U-box domain being the anchor site for E2s. Binding of the RING domain was shown to activate the release of ubiquitin from E2 and this likely applies to the U-box domain as well but the activation mechanism is not known (Ozkan et al., 2005; Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009). Overall, our understanding of the ubiquitin transfer mechanism from E2–E3/E4 to substrate is rudimentary and this is particularly true for U-box proteins. S. cerevisiae Ufd2 (ubiquitin fusion degradation protein 2), the first chain elongation factor E4 to be described, has been shown to promote polyubiquitylation of artificial fusion proteins and is the prototype U-box protein (Koegl et al., 1999). Ufd2 binds the chaperone cdc48 component of the Ufd1–Npl4–cdc48 complex that facilitates the translocation of polyubiquitinated proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol for subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome (Richly et al., 2005). Several other members of the U-box family of ubiquitin ligases interact with chaperones or chaperone binding proteins, suggesting a general function of U-box-containing ubiquitin ligases in the proteosomal degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins (Hatakeyama et al., 2004). The mammalian homologue of Ufd2, called UFD2a or E4B, is also a U-box-containing E4 enzyme that was shown to promote the degradation of a pathological form of ataxin-3, the gene product implicated in the Machado-Joseph disease (Matsumoto et al., 2004). Human E4B functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase as well in vitro when provided with the human E2 conjugating enzymes Ubc4 or UbcH5c (Hatakeyama et al., 2001). The mechanism by which U-box ubiquitin ligases function together with E2 conjugating enzymes is poorly understood. A molecular understanding of these enzymes is limited with only one U-box protein – CHIP (C-terminal Hsp70 interacting protein) – that has been characterized structurally in complex with different E2s (Xu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2005). Here we show that unlike CHIP and all other isolated U-box domains characterized to date, human E4B U-box is a monomer, both in the free state and in complex with human UbcH5c or Ubc4 E2 enzymes. We present the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structure of E4B U-box, including an NMR-based characterization of a hydrogen bond network in the U-box domain. We also present the crystal structures of human E4B U-box, Ubc4 and E4B U-box in complex with UbcH5c. Data from NMR chemical shift mapping validate the crystal structure of E4B U-box–UbcH5c in solution and suggest a possible allosteric regulation of UbcH5c and Ubc4 by E4B U-Box. Our structural studies of the interactions of human E4B with UbcH5c and Ubc4, combined with previously published structures of budding yeast Ufd2 (Tu et al., 2007) and human UbcH5c bound to ubiquitin (Brzovic et al., 2006) provide a molecular framework to better understand the mechanism by which U-box-containing ubiquitin ligases function. RESULTS. SOLUTION STRUCTURE OF THE U-BOX DOMAIN OF E4B. As a prelude to structure determination, we evaluated the oligomerization state of a region of human E4B, amino acids (aa) 1208 to 1302, that encompasses the U-box domain. The strong signals observed for this protein construct and the absence of changes in chemical shifts in the 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectrum of E4B as a function of protein concentration in the ~0.4 – 2.0 mM range suggested that E4B U-box was a monomer. This is unlike other U-box domains characterized to date, which dimerize in this concentration range (Andersen et al., 2004; Vander Kooi et al., 2006). Consistent with a monomeric state, as explained below in the analysis of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data, a control ITC dilution experiment that we performed with an initial high concentration (i.e. 3 mM) of E4B U-box did not reveal any marked change in heat signal that could be attributed to oligomer dissociation in the calorimeter cell. Dynamic light scattering measurements also suggested an apparent molecular weight of 11 kDa, which coincides with the molecular weight of a monomeric E4B U-box domain (data not shown). We note with interest that the full-length Ufd2 protein, thought to be the homologue of E4B in budding yeast, is also a monomer in solution (Tu et al., 2007). The structure of E4B U-box (aa 1208-1302) was determined using NMR spectroscopy (Figures 1A and 1B).

20720015,"Structure and functional analysis of LptC, a conserved membrane protein involved in the lipopolysaccharide export pathway in Escherichia coli. INTRODUCTION. The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, is comprised of an asymmetric lipid bilayer with phospholipids in the inner leaflet and glycolipids, predominately lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in the outer leaflet (1). LPS is an essential component of the OM in most Gram-negative pathogens, and its unique structural features contribute to the effective permeability properties of the OM (2–4). In E. coli and many other Gram-negative bacteria, LPS is composed of the lipid A moiety, typically a highly conserved diglucosamine-based phospholipid, that is linked to the long chain polysaccharide known as O-antigen via a core oligosaccharide (5). The structure and many elements of the biosynthesis of LPS have been established (reviewed in Refs. 4–6). However, the precise mechanism(s) of transport and assembly at the cell surface still remain(s) obscure. The lipid A-core region is synthesized in consecutive steps at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane (IM) (5) and is exported across the IM by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter MsbA (7, 8). O-antigen is synthesized independently by one of the three different pathways and is ligated to the lipid A-core moiety by the WaaL ligase at the periplasmic face of the IM (5). The complete LPS molecule then interacts with the LPS transport (Lpt) machinery (6). It is believed to be extracted from the IM by an ABC protein complex comprised of LptB (a predicted ABC protein) (9, 10), LptF (11), LptG (11), and LptC (12, 13). Each of these proteins is essential for LPS transport and viability in E. coli. Recent data have established that LptBFGC forms a stable complex in a 2:1:1:1 stoichiometry (13). Once LPS is released from the IM, its transit across the periplasm is proposed to be facilitated by LptA, a soluble periplasmic protein (9). However, the exact mechanism by which LPS is moved across the periplasm and through the peptidoglycan layer is still unknown. The final steps in the pathway are attributed to two OM proteins: LptD, a protein with predicted β-barrel structure, and LptE, a lipoprotein (14–17). Both proteins are essential in E. coli and required for LPS assembly on the cell surface. LptD and LptE form a stable interaction in a 1:1 complex (16). LptE also binds LPS in vitro (16). Two models have been proposed for LPS transport across the periplasm (9, 18). In the first, oligomers of LptA form a proteinaceous bridge that physically connects the IM and OM, allowing for direct transfer of LPS to the OM. Evidence supporting this model was provided by the formation of LptA filaments when crystallized in the presence of LPS (18). In the filament, LptA monomers interact in a head-to-tail fashion, forming a linear filament with four monomers constituting one turn of a left-handed helix (18). The proposal is also consistent with continued LPS export detected in spheroplasts of E. coli (19). In addition, the entire Lpt machinery was recently identified in E. coli membrane fractions that contained markers of both inner and outer membranes, providing additional evidence that the Lpt proteins form a trans-envelope complex (20). The second model proposes that the LPS export pathway is analogous to the Lol-mediated lipoprotein transport, and the similarity between the various components in the two systems is striking. In the lipoprotein trafficking pathway, LolCDE represents an ABC protein complex required for the release of nascent lipoproteins from the IM to a periplasmic chaperone, LolA (21, 22). LolA transfers its cargo to LolB in the OM (23). LptBFG may be the functional equivalent of LolCDE, but the lipoprotein export pathway has no obvious component analogous to LptC. To gain further understanding of the LPS export pathway, the properties of LptC were investigated. The data reported here describe the crystal structure of the soluble periplasmic portion of LptC at 2.2-Å resolution and the structural relationships between LptA and LptC. Like LptA, LptC binds LPS in vitro, and the results suggest that LptC transfers LPS to LptA in a unidirectional manner. MATERIALS AND METHODS. BACTERIAL STRAINS AND RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNIQUES. All bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Recombinant DNA and molecular biology techniques were performed as described previously (24). CONSTRUCTION OF PLASMIDS. Primers used for cloning are listed in Table 2. Plasmid pWQ480 was constructed by amplifying lptC from E. coli W3110 with primers MT5 and MT6 and cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pBAD24 (25). The reverse primer incorporates the sequence for a C-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag. Using plasmid pWQ480 as the template, single-cysteine derivatives of LptC were made by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers MT37 and MT38 were used to introduce the codon for a single Cys residue between codons 1 and 2 of LptC to generate pWQ483. Primers MT39 and MT40 were used to introduce the codon for a single cysteine residue between codons 185 and 186 of LptC, generating pWQ484. A 507-bp DNA fragment, encoding residues 24–191 of LptC (191 residues in total for LptC), was amplified from W3110 with primers MT30 and MT27 and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET28a (Novagen), producing the plasmid pWQ481. The absence of the transmembrane helix in this construct yielded a soluble cytoplasmic protein. The His6-LptC(24–191) construct includes an N-terminal thrombin/His6 affinity tag. To facilitate removal of the His6 tag, a version of LptC(24–191) containing a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site was constructed by amplifying lptC from W3110 with primers MT28 and MT56. The PCR fragment was then cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pBAD24 to generate the plasmid pWQ482. A removable C-terminal His6-tagged version of LptA, also containing a TEV protease recognition site, was constructed by amplifying lptA from W3110 wit",PMC,pos,1,pos,2453,pos_PMC,0.99601597,1

20804767,"Structure of a longitudinal actin dimer assembled by tandem w domains: implications for actin filament nucleation. INTRODUCTION. The nucleation of actin filaments in cells is kinetically unfavorable because of the instability of polymerization intermediates (dimers, trimers and tetramers) and the actions of actin monomer binding proteins such as profilin and thymosin-β4 (Tβ4) 1; 2. This creates an opportunity for cells to use molecules known as actin filament nucleators to initiate the formation of actin polymerization nuclei in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. The actin filament can be described as either a single left-handed short-pitch helix, where consecutive subunits are staggered with respect to one another by half a monomer length, or two right-handed long-pitch helices of head-to-tail bound actin subunits 3; 4; 5. Different nucleators work by different mechanisms, stabilizing small actin oligomers along either the long- or the short-pitch helices of the actin filament 6; 7. Most actin filament nucleators use the WASP-Homology 2 (WH2 or W) domain for interaction with actin. The W domain has a short length (17–27aa) and is extremely abundant and functionally versatile 7; 8; 9. The N-terminal portion of the W domain forms a helix that binds in the hydrophobic (or target-binding) cleft 10 formed between subdomains 1 and 3 at the barbed end of the actin monomer 11; 12; 13. After this helix, the W domain presents an extended region that is directed towards the pointed end of the actin monomer (formed by subdomains 2 and 4 of actin). This region is variable in length and sequence, but comprises the conserved four residue motif LKKT(V), which is critical for the interaction with actin 11. Filament nucleators are characterized by the presence of multiple actin-binding sites. The simplest and most common architecture consists of tandem repeats of the W domain, occurring in the proteins Spire 14, Cobl 15 and VopL/VopF 16; 17. The W domain also participates in filament nucleation through the Nucleation Promoting Factors (NPFs) of the Arp2/3 complex, which can have between one and three W domains 18; 19; 20. The muscle-specific nucleator Lmod also contains one W domain 21. The nucleation activities of tandem W domain-based nucleators vary widely. At least in part, the reason for these differences may lie in the highly variable linkers between W domains. When the linkers are short, as in the relatively weak nucleator Spire 14, only actin subunits along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament can be connected. In contrast, the brain-enriched protein Cobl is a strong nucleator, featuring three W domains with a long linker between its second and third W domains, and is thought to stabilize a short-pitch actin trimer for nucleation 15. The examples of Cobl, the Arp2/3 complex, and formins suggest that stabilization of a short-pitch actin nucleus is a more effective way to promote polymerization than stabilization of a long-pitch actin nucleus 6; 7. However, the structural bases for this observation are not well understood. In an attempt to understand the nucleation mechanism of tandem W domain-based nucleators, we recently reported a solution study, using Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), of an actin dimer and a trimer stabilized by tandem W domain constructs 22. These complexes, referred to as 2W-Actin and 3W-Actin, and containing respectively two and three W domains, were capped at the barbed end by structure-based crosslinking of the first W domain to Cys-374 of the first actin subunit and at the pointed end by addition of the C-terminal helix of Tβ4. Constructs 2W and 3W are based on the W domain repeat present in the NPF protein N-WASP, which like Spire presents short inter-W linkers. The SAXS study suggested that the actin subunits in the complexes adopted an elongated conformation similar to that of the long-pitch helix of the actin filament. However, the resolution of this study was insufficient to establish a direct comparison between the longitudinal contacts of actin subunits in the complexes and in the actin filament. Here we report the crystal structure of 3W-Actin at 7 Å resolution. Only two actin subunits are present in the structure, indicating that one of the actin subunits is released during crystallization. Despite its low resolution, this structure, obtained by fitting high-resolution structures of W-Actin complexes into the low-resolution data, offers a clearer picture of the relative disposition of actin subunits bound to tandem W domains that are separated by Spire-like short inter-W linkers. While the longitudinal arrangement of actin subunits in the structure is somewhat related to that of the long-pitch helix of the actin filament 3; 4, important differences are observed. These differences probably result from steric hindrance of the W domain with inter-subunit contacts in the filament. The determination of the structure of 3W-Actin was aided by determination of the 2.9 Å resolution crystal structure of the first W domains of VopL 16 crosslinked to actin Cys-374 (hereafter referred to as WxActin). The structure of WxActin is nearly undistinguishable from non-crosslinked W-Actin structures determined previously 11; 12; 13, thus validating the use of crosslinking as a tool to stabilize actin polymerization complexes for structural investigation. The structures, and a biochemical analysis of nucleation, reveal important clues about the existing disparities in the nucleation activities of tandem W domain-based nucleators. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF CROSSLINKED WXACTIN. In two previous studies, we reported low-resolution SAXS structures of actin nucleation complexes formed by the Arp2/3 complex and tandem W domains 22; 23. Barbed end polymerization in these studies was blocked by crosslinking of the W domain to Cys-374 of the actin subunit located at the barbed end of the complexes. This approach was based on analysis of the structures of various W-actin complexes 11; 12; 13, which placed the N-terminus of the W domain within disulfide bond distance to",PMC,pos,1,pos,2465,pos_PMC,0.9973888,1
20823850,"Clinical efficacy of a RAF inhibitor needs broad target blockade in BRAF-mutant melanoma. PLX4032 belongs to a family of mutant B-RAF kinase inhibitors discovered using a scaffold-based drug design approach.6 The crystallography-guided approach allowed optimization of a compound with modest preference for the mutated form of B-RAF (B-RAFV600E) in comparison to wild-type B-RAF. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the differential ability for PLX4032 to inhibit the activity of over 200 kinases. PLX4032 displays similar potency for B-RAFV600E (31nM) and c-RAF-1 (48nM) and selectivity against many other kinases, including wild type B-RAF (100nM). While the vast majority of kinases are minimally affected, several were found that were also inhibited at <100 nM concentrations in biochemical assays; to date, inhibition of these non-RAF kinases such as ACK1, KHS1 and SRMS has not been tested in cellular assays. As previously demonstrated for the related B-RAF inhibitor PLX4720,6 the biochemical selectivity of PLX4032 translates to cellular selectivity: potent inhibition of ERK phosphorylation and proliferation occurs exclusively in BRAF-mutant cell lines.4. PLX4032 was crystallized with a protein construct that contained the kinase domain of B-RAFV600E.PLX4032 (Figure 1A) binds in the active site of one of the protomers in the non-crystallographic-symmetry related dimer (Figure 1). As previously described for the related RAF inhibitor PLX4720 (PDB ID: 3C4C),6 the PLX4032-bound protomer adopts the DFG-in conformation to enable the formation of a unique hydrogen bond between the backbone NH of Asp594 and the sulfonamide nitrogen of PLX4032 (Figure 1B). In addition, PLX4032-binding causes an outward shift in the regulatory αC helix, which may explain why the effect of PLX4720 and PLX4032 on RAF dimerization is so different from other RAF inhibitors such as AZD-628 and GDC-0879 (Figure 1C).7 The apo-protomer displays the DFG-in conformation with the activation loop locked away from the ATP-binding site by a salt-bridge between Glu600 and Lys507 (Figure 1D). In BRAFV600E-mutant xenograft studies, PLX4032 demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth, with higher exposures resulting in tumor regression (Figure 2A and reference 4). Efficacy could be demonstrated in cell lines and xenografts bearing either homozygous or heterozygous BRAF mutations. By contrast, no effect was observed on melanoma xenograft growth if both BRAF alleles were wild-type.4,6 Due to their consistent pharmacokinetics in rodents, PLX4032 and PLX4720 were prioritized over a panel of related compounds that all displayed similar activities in vitro and in vivo. For further drug development, PLX4032 was chosen (over PLX4720) because its pharmacokinetic properties scaled appropriately in beagle dogs and cynomolgus monkeys. In order to estimate PLX4032 exposures (as defined by AUC 0-24, the Area Under the plasma Concentration time curve over the dosing period of 24 hours) that correlated with tumor response, conventionally formulated daily oral doses of PLX4032 were administered in the BRAFV600E-bearing colorectal cancer COLO205 xenograft model. In this model, tumor growth inhibition was modest at 6 mg/kg (AUC 0-24 ~ 50 μM*hr), tumor stabilization was seen at 20 mg/kg (AUC 0-24 ~ 200 μM*hr), and significant tumor regressions were observed at 20 mg/kg BID (AUC 0-24 ~ 300 μM*hr). BRAFV600E-bearing melanoma xenograft models, including NCI-LOX and COLO829 are also sensitive to PLX4032.4. Rats and beagle dogs were dosed for 28 days with increasing doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day, and no toxicity was detected at any dose level. Likewise, no adverse effects were detected in a standard battery of safety pharmacology studies. Subsequent toxicology studies of longer duration, 26 weeks in rats and 13 weeks in dogs, further confirmed the tolerability of the compound. This safety profile was achieved in spite of very high compound exposures, reaching 2600 μM*h in rats and 820 μM*h in dogs. The rat exposures exceeded those that were effective in patients (see below). Importantly, no histological changes were observed in the skin in any animal at any dose or duration of treatment, contrasting to results observed with other RAF inhibitors.7. These preclinical findings provided the necessary support in order to initiate Phase 1 clinical testing in cancer patients. Clinical and pharmacokinetic results from this Phase 1 study recently have been reported.5 In the initial stage of the Phase 1 study, cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with escalating doses of PLX4032 (ranging from 200 to 1600 mg), administered twice-daily as oral capsules. The initial crystalline formulation yielded modest drug exposures, so PLX4032 was reformulated as a microprecipitated bulk powder (MBP) and doses ranging from 160 to 1120 mg BID were sequentially evaluated. Preclinical experiments in mice (Figure 2B and reference 4) and dogs demonstrated that the MBP formulation substantially increased drug bioavailability by ten-fold. This improved bioavailability also was observed in patients, with mean exposures at a 160 mg BID dose of the MBP formulation (day 15 AUC 0-24 = 185 μM·h) similar to a 1600 mg BID dose of the original formulation (day 15 AUC 0-24 = 203 μM·h). During the dose-escalation phase of the clinical trial, twenty-one patients with metastatic melanoma, sixteen with and five without BRAF-mutations, were treated at doses that achieved AUC 0-24 > 300 μM·h.5 Tumor dimensions were measured by computed tomography (CT). Ten patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma achieved tumor regressions qualifying as partial responses (PR, by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST 1.0], >30% reduction in tumor dimensions) and one patient had a complete response (CR); none of the patients with melanomas lacking BRAF mutations achieved PR. These data along with preclinical evidence of selectivity for BRAF-mutant cell lines strongly justified limiting all further enrollment to patients with BRAF-mutant tumors.

20875424,"Dynamic interactions between clathrin and locally structured elements in a disordered protein mediate clathrin lattice assembly. INTRODUCTION. Clathrin mediated vesicular trafficking is a fundamental mechanism used by all compartmentalized cells to move proteins between different compartments in the biosynthetic-secretory and endocytic pathways1. This process begins on the membrane, when clathrin assembly/adaptor proteins such as AP2 and AP180 are cooperatively recruited via interactions with the phosphoinositide PIP22 and with membrane bound cargo molecules3. This nascent complex in turn recruits cytosolic clathrin, and nucleates the formation of a clathrin coated pit4. As the coated pit grows, additional accessory proteins are recruited which promote membrane scission, allowing clathrin coated vesicles (CCVs) to detach from the membrane5. The CCVs are then rapidly uncoated via a chaperone mediated reaction that returns the coat proteins to the cytosol and the liberated transport vesicles then deliver their cargo molecules to an appropriate sub-cellular compartment by membrane fusion6; 7. Most of the molecular players in this process are well characterized. Indeed, we have crystal structures of clathrin8; 9, the domains of the clathrin assembly proteins that interact with phosphoinositides, cargo molecules, and accessory proteins4; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19, as well as many components of the uncoating apparatus20; 21; 22; 23. However, while peptides corresponding to the clathrin binding sites of the assembly proteins have been co-crystallized with the clathrin terminal domain24; 25, the clathrin binding domains of these proteins have never been crystallized, probably because these domains appear to be intrinsically disordered26. AP180 is a monomeric clathrin assembly protein27 with a ~33kD N-terminal domain (NTD) with an amino acid sequence typical of a globular protein, and an ~58kD C-terminal domain (CTD) with a highly repetitive structure which is unusually acidic and rich in proline, serine, threonine, and alanine residues, and a low propensity to form amphipathic α helices28; 29. AP180 migrates anomalously on SDS-PAGE, due to the highly acidic CTD29. These features of the AP180 CTD are typical for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)30. Further evidence that the CTD of AP180 is an IDP came from circular dichroism (CD) measurements31, and from programs designed to identify IDPs, which led to its inclusion in the DisProt database (DP0025)32. Further work revealed that the 33kD NTD has the structure of an ANTH domain, and is involved in phosphoinositide binding4; 13; 33, while the 58kD CTD was shown to be involved in clathrin binding and assembly34 (Fig. 1). A self-homology analysis of the CTD revealed it to contain 12 degenerate repeats, each approximately 23aa in length34. Each of these repeats contains a central DLL/DLF sequence, which has been hypothesized27 to be a variation of the clathrin-box motif first described in the linker region of the tetrameric adaptor protein AP324; 35. The CTD of AP180 binds to the N-terminal domain (TD) of the clathrin heavy chain34, which contains binding sites for the clathrin-box peptides24. It has recently become recognized that as many as 25–30% of all eukaryotic proteins are intrinsically disordered36. One of the most useful tools that has been applied to the study of these intrinsically disordered proteins is NMR spectroscopy, since it is suitable for the study of flexible as well as ordered proteins, and provides measures of protein dynamics37. In this study we utilized NMR spectroscopy, together with other solution approaches, to characterize the interaction between a large fragment of the AP180 CTD and the clathrin TD. This ~5kD fragment contains 2 putative clathrin binding sites and encompasses a middle segment (aa 623-680) of the AP180 CTD, and was therefore designated AP180 M538 (Fig. 1). We demonstrate that the DLL and DLF sequences within the putative clathrin binding sites are, indeed, critical for clathrin binding and measure their dissociation constants and binding rates. Furthermore, our studies reveal that while AP180 M5 is largely unstructured, there are local β turn-like structures at the clathrin binding sites, in both the free and clathrin TD bound states. The AP180 clathrin binding domain therefore appears to be neither an example of a fully structured protein, nor a completely disordered protein that assumes structure upon binding its partner. Instead, it is a largely disordered protein interspersed with multiple, short elements pre-structured to bind the clathrin TD. Therefore AP180 seems to be an example of a ‘fuzzy’ IDP, that is to say a protein which is disordered even in the partner-bound state39. At the same time, it is also an example of an IDP in which preformed structural elements play a key role in partner recognition40. These features make AP180 particularly well suited to its function as a clathrin assembly protein. By analogy to the fishing technique in which a long flexible line is baited at regular intervals with multiple hooks, this has been described as a line fishing mechanism for recruitment of clathrin to endocytic sites26; 31; 41. We find that the interaction of each of these ‘hooks’ with clathrin is weak and characterized by extremely fast association and dissociation rates, but the concentration of multiple clathrin binding elements at an endocytic site nevertheless provides for efficient clathrin recruitment, while the weakness of the individual interactions allows the recruited clathrin to have the motional freedom required for the dynamic assembly of the clathrin lattice at the endocytic site.

20886116,"Crystal structure of human AKT1 with an allosteric inhibitor reveals a new mode of kinase inhibition. INTRODUCTION. Aberrant regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of several human cancers and inhibitors for multiple targets in this pathway are in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer [1]. There are three isozymes of human AKT (AKT1, 2, and 3, also known as PKB-α, -β and -γ), each containing an amino (N)-terminal PH domain, inter-domain linker, kinase domain and 21-residue carboxy (C)-terminal hydrophobic motif (HM) [2], [3]. The PH domain directs AKT translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane by binding to the membrane lipids phosphatidylinositide (PtdIns)(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which are products of phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K). AKT is subsequently phosphorylated resulting in kinase activation [4]. Due to the tractability of kinases as pharmacological targets and the observed hyperactivation of AKT in many cancers, several small molecule inhibitors of AKT have been described (recently reviewed [5]). The majority of described AKT inhibitors are competitive with ATP, non-selective against AKT isozymes, and poorly selective against closely related kinases. Efforts to identify AKT specific and isozyme-selective inhibitors resulted in the discovery of novel selective, allosteric AKT inhibitors [6], [7]. As only a few kinases have been reported to be allosterically inhibited by small molecules [8], [9], [10], further investigation into the requirements for allosteric AKT inhibition was undertaken. Intriguingly, a new allosteric inhibition paradigm was revealed in which the presence of both the regulatory PH domain and catalytic kinase domain were required for allosteric inhibition. Subsequently the allosteric AKT inhibitors were optimized for clinical use and recently one, MK-2206, was reported to be well-tolerated in a Phase I clinical trial [11]. Comprehensive and elegant experimentation revealed substantial differences in the relative positions of the PH and kinase domains of inactive and membrane-associated AKT [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], resulting in the inactive form being termed the closed or ‘PH-in’ conformation; whereas the membrane-associated form is referred to as the open or ‘PH-out’ conformation. More in-depth characterization of Inhibitor VIII (Figure 1), a commercially available PH domain-dependent allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor (Compound 16 h) [7], showed that Inhibitor VIII is dependent upon the presence of Trp 80 in the PH domain for its activity; and the inhibitor binds to a generally characterized ‘PH-in’ conformation of AKT1 [15], [17]. Therefore, in order to further our understanding of the regulation and inhibition of AKT and to aid in the design of selective AKT inhibitors, we extensively screened for crystals of AKT complexed to an allosteric inhibitor. Here we report the crystal structure of AKT1 complexed to Inhibitor VIII at 2.7 Å resolution (PDB code: 3O96). RESULTS. We expressed, purified, and set-up crystallization screens of full-length AKT1 and AKT2 pre-incubated with Inhibitor VIII. After 2.5 months, we observed a single small crystal in a full-length AKT1 crystal screen and determined from initial diffraction patterns that the crystal was proteinaceous. After the long time required for crystal growth, concern that the protein was proteolyzed in the crystallization drop arose, so the crystal was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We observed two major truncated forms of AKT1 protein from the crystal including one which was approximately 6,000 Daltons (Da) smaller than the starting material (Figure S1). We hypothesized that the most likely region for proteolysis resulting in a 50 kDa fragment would be in the disordered region encompassing the C-terminal HM segment. Therefore several carboxy-terminal truncated AKT1 (ΔHM-AKT1) constructs were expressed to identify a modestly truncated form suitable for crystallographic studies. ΔHM-AKT1(1-443) was successfully purified and its binding to Inhibitor VIII was analyzed using differential scanning fluorimetry [18] (Figure S2). We were able to co-crystallize ΔHM-AKT1(1–443) with Inhibitor VIII and to solve its structure to 2.7 Å resolution (Table 1 and Figure 2). Figure 3 shows the overall structure of the allosterically inhibited enzyme. The PH domain nestles between the N- and C-lobes of the kinase domain with Inhibitor VIII binding to all three regions. The conformation of the PH domain is similar to the previously determined apo structure [19] (RMSD = 1.14 Å for all Cα's) with significant conformational differences in the regions binding to the inhibitor and kinase domain described below. Both lobes of the kinase domain are in inactive conformations reminiscent of the unphosphorylated structure of AKT2 kinase domain [16]: residues 189–198 of the αC-helix and residues 299–312 of the activation loop are disordered, while the side chain of Phe 293 blocks the ATP binding site. In Figure 4 the complex structure of activated AKT1 kinase domain and an ATP-competitive inhibitor is superposed upon the co-crystal structure of inactive AKT1:Inhibitor VIII [20] illustrating not only the structural differences between the N-lobes of the kinase domain and Phe 293 positions, but also the >10 Å distance between inhibitor binding sites. The superimposed structures show the PH domain fills part of the space occupied by the αC-helix and phosphorylated activation loop in the activated AKT kinase domain structures [20], [21]; thereby sterically preventing the kinase domain from attaining an active conformation. Interactions between the PH domain and the kinase domain are concentrated in two regions of the kinase domain – in the N-lobe adjacent to the ATP-binding cleft and in the C-lobe (Figure 5A). The PH domain buries 1,526 Å2 of its surface in this complex and a combination of hydrogen bonds and nonpolar interactions are observed in both regions of this interface.

The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for controlling cell cycle transitions, is a multisubunit complex assembled from 13 different proteins. Numerous APC/C subunits incorporate multiple copies of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR). Here, we report the crystal structure of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cut9 (Cdc16/Apc6) in complex with Hcn1 (Cdc26), showing that Cdc16/Cut9 is a contiguous TPR superhelix of 14 TPR units. A C-terminal block of TPR motifs interacts with Hcn1, whereas an N-terminal TPR block mediates Cdc16/Cut9 self-association through a homotypic interface. This dimer interface is structurally related to the N-terminal dimerization domain of Cdc27, demonstrating that both Cdc16/Cut9 and Cdc27 form homo-dimers through a conserved mechanism. The acetylated N-terminal Met residue of Hcn1 is enclosed within a chamber created from the Cut9 TPR superhelix. Thus, in complex with Cdc16/Cut9, the N-acetyl-Met residue of Hcn1, a putative degron for the Doa10 E3 ubiquitin ligase, is inaccessible for Doa10 recognition, protecting Hcn1/Cdc26 from ubiquitin-dependent degradation.

20942272,"Helicobacter pylori infection and cytokine gene polymorphisms in Uzbeks. INTRODUCTION. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection plays a key role in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases, including stomach cancer. Two thirds of world populations are reportedly infected, but only some of them actually develop H. pylori-associated diseases. CagA–positive strains are associated with a higher degree of gastric mucosal damage, inducing an immune response. It seems reasonable to assume that the degree of immunological response corresponds to the levels of mucosal inflammation, which could influence the conditions conducive to persistent H. pylori infection and subsequent gastric atrophy. The inflammatory process is regulated by biological mediators including cytokines produced by epithelial cells. H. pylori secretes several factors that contribute to the inflammatory process by stimulating the release of cytokines such as interleukins (IL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, with the difference in the amount of cytokines produced possibly accounting for the varying clinical presentations of H. pylori infection. Since cytokine production is regulated partly at the transcriptional level, functional polymorphisms in the promoter region could act as potential determinants of H. pylori infection susceptibility and its outcomes. In the present study, polymorphisms of relevant cytokines were evaluated in an Uzbek population along with their associations with anti-H. pylori and anti-CagA seropositivity, as well as with gastric atrophy (GA) measured with serum pepsinogen (PG), were examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS. STUDY SUBJECTS. Subjects were participants in a case-control study of digestive ulcers among 167 ethnic Uzbeks (89 males and 78 females), including 84 with a definitive diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) (77 with duodenal ulcer and 7 with gastric ulcer), 35 with other miscellaneous diseases (14 with acute appendicitis, 17 with acute cholecystitis, and 4 with hernia) and 48 healthy subjects (students and staff), with subjects divided into three groups according to recruitment sources. Blood samples were obtained between January and March 2007 in the Republic Research Center of Emergency Medicine, Tashkent, Uzbekistan, after informed consent was obtained. The samples were immediately stored at –20°C until analysis. None of the participants enrolled in the study had been treated for PUD before enrollment, and none were under medication with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. LABORATORY TESTS. Anti-H. pylori and anti-CagA IgG antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). E-plate Eiken H. pylori antibody (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and CagA IgG EIA WELL (Radim SpA, Rome, Italy), respectively, were used. Serum PG1 and PG2 were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA). Gastric mucosal atrophy was categorized as “none” (PG1≥70 ng/ml or PG1/PG2≥3), or “positive” (PG1<70 ng/ml and PG1/PG2<3). GENOTYPING. DNA was extracted from a heparinized buffy coat with a BioRobot M48 Workstation (QIAGEN Group, Tokyo). All cytokine polymorphisms (IL-1B C-31T, IL-2 T-330G, IL-4 C-33T, IL-8 T-251A, IL-10 T-819C, IL-13 C-1111T, TNF-A C-857T, and TNF-A T-1031C) were genotyped using a polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers (PCR-CTPP), as described in the previous studies. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 11.0. Logistic regression analysis was applied for the estimation of odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was examined with a chi-square test. Age, sex, and recruitment source (three subject groups) were adjusted to exclude any potential confounding. The study was approved by the local medical authority in Uzbekistan and the Ethics Committee of Nagoya University, Graduate School of Medicine (approval number 459). RESULTS. Table 1 shows the seropositivity for anti-H. pylori antibody and anti-CagA antibody, as well as those with GA. The mean age for all participants was 37.9 years, ranging from 15 to 86 years. One-hundred-twenty-five samples (74.9%) were positive for anti-H. pylori antibody and 143 (85.6%) for anti-CagA antibody. GA was found in 44 cases (26.3%). Anti-H. pylori IgG seropositivity was higher among women (80.8%) than men (69.7%), though roughly the same prevalence of anti-CagA IgG seropositivity and GA were found in both sexes. Anti-H. pylori antibody-positive and GA were the most common among the healthy volunteers, although they were the youngest as a group. The anti-CagA antibody-positive was found to be the most prevalent in the PUD group. The difference in seropositivity between anti-H. pylori antibody and anti-CagA antibody in the PUD group was 21.5%. Table 2 shows genotype distributions and allele frequencies, as well as p values for a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. All genotype distributions except for IL-8 T-251A (p<0.05) were in a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. As Table 3 shows, the IL-4 -33CT genotype was significantly associated with anti-H. pylori seropositivity; OR=2.33 (95% CI, 1.04–5.19) relative to -33CC, although the OR of -33CT/TT relative to -33CC was not significant. TNF-A -1031TC heterozygotes posed a significantly high risk for anti-H. pylori seropositivity relative to -1031TT; OR=2.82 (95% CI, 1.05–7.57). Similarly, the OR of -1031TC/CC relative to -1031TT was not significant. No other genotypes were significantly associated with the risks of anti-H. pylori– seropositive, anti-CagA–seropositive, or gastric atrophy. DISCUSSION. The present study revealed that the enrolled Uzbek subjects were highly infected with CagA-positive H. pylori strains. Among the eight polymorphisms, IL-4 C-33T and TNF-A T-1031C were significantly associated with the anti-H. pylori antibody. Such significant associations were observed only for the heterozygotes of both polymorphisms relative to the major homozygotes; when the minor homozygotes were included the OR became insignificant.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase (MtAPR) is an iron-sulfur protein and a validated target to develop new antitubercular agents, particularly for the treatment of latent infection. The enzyme harbors a [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster that is coordinated by four cysteinyl ligands, two of which are adjacent in the amino acid sequence. The iron-sulfur cluster is essential for catalysis; however, the precise role of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in APR remains unknown. Progress in this area has been hampered by the failure to generate a paramagnetic state of the [4Fe-4S] cluster that can be studied by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Herein, we overcome this limitation and report the EPR spectra of MtAPR in the [4Fe-4S](+) state. The EPR signal is rhombic and consists of two overlapping S = &frac12; species. Substrate binding to MtAPR led to a marked increase in the intensity and resolution of the EPR signal and to minor shifts in principle g values that were not observed among a panel of substrate analogs, including adenosine 5'-diphosphate. Using site-directed mutagenesis, in conjunction with kinetic and EPR studies, we have also identified an essential role for the active site residue Lys-144, whose side chain interacts with both the iron-sulfur cluster and the sulfate group of adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate.

BACKGROUND In 2005, we reported removal of functional restriction after primary THA performed through the anterolateral approach did not increase the incidence of dislocation. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES To develop a current practice guideline, we evaluated the incidence of early dislocation after primary THA after implementation of a no-restriction protocol. METHODS Between January 2005 and December 2007, 2532 patients (2764 hips; 1541 women, 1223 men; mean age, 63.2 years [28-98 years]) underwent primary THA at our institution. Bilateral THA was performed in 232 patients (464 hips). The direct anterior or anterolateral approach was used in all patients. Femoral head size was 28, 32, or 36 mm. Patients were given no traditional functional restrictions postoperatively, such as use of elevated seats, abduction pillows, and restriction from driving. All patients received standard care at the judgment of the attending surgeon. One hundred forty-six patients missed followup appointments despite efforts to be contacted by telephone. The remaining 2386 of 2532 patients (94%) had a minimum followup of 6 months (mean, 14.2 months; range, 6-34 months). RESULTS Four known dislocations occurred in the followed cohort of 2386 patients with 2612 hips (0.15%) at a mean of 5 days (3-12 days) postoperatively, none related to high-impact trauma. One dislocation occurred in a patient with a history of developmental dysplasia of the hip, two dislocations occurred while at the toilet (one with a previous hip fracture treated with a modular system), and one dislocation was idiopathic. CONCLUSIONS We confirmed a low incidence of dislocation after primary THA in the absence of early postoperative restrictions.

21087998,"7SK small nuclear RNA directly affects HMGA1 function in transcription regulation. INTRODUCTION. Small non-coding (nc) RNAs are increasingly recognized to play crucial roles in both, pre- and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression (1). They may act to directly affect components of the chromatin remodeling (2), the transcription (3) and translation (4) apparatuses. Also, ncRNAs have been reported to affect protein stability, localization and post-translational modification (5,6). Among the best studied ncRNAs involved in pre-transcriptional regulation is the 7SK RNA. 7SK is a RNA Polymerase III transcript of 331 nt in mammals, belonging to the highly abundant small nuclear (sn) RNAs (7). It is stabilized by a γ-monomethylephosphate-GTP cap on its 5′-end, which is synthesized by the methylephosphate capping enzyme (MePCE) (8,9). The La-related protein LARP7 has been shown to associate with the 3′-poly(U) region of 7SK RNA, thereby contributing to the stability of the RNA as well (10). Recent studies revealed that MePCE and LARP7 act cooperatively to maintain the integrity of 7SK snRNP (11). 7SK RNA is evolutionary highly conserved among vertebrates (12) and is also found in higher invertebrates, such as Drosophila melanogaster (13). Since its discovery in 1976 (14), it took a quarter century until two groups discovered a key function of 7SK RNA in the regulation of gene transcription elongation (15,16): 7SK RNA and HEXIM1 or HEXIM2 bind to the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and mask its cyclin-dependent kinase-9 activity, required for cyclin T1 or T2-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA Polymerase II. Thus, P-TEFb's role in RNA Polymerase II transcription elongation is abolished. This mechanism is thought to establish negative regulatory control of the RNA Polymerase II elongation activity as a function of 7SK RNA nuclear concentrations for P-TEFb-dependent gene expression. Several P-TEFb target genes have been identified to date (KLK3, IL8, CYP1A1, MCL1, CKM, SLC2A4, NR4A1) (17–21), and P-TEFb is known to play a role in transcription elongation from the HIV long terminal repeat (22,23). With little surprise it was recently possible to also place 7SK RNA at the center of Tat-dependent transcription complexes (24). The mechanism of 7SK RNA binding to P-TEFb and CDK9 inhibition is well characterized and understood (25). Loops 1, 3 and 4 of the predicted secondary structure of 7SK RNA (see Figure 1A) are thereby directly involved in P-TEFb binding, and serve as a molecular scaffold for the assembly of the inactive P-TEFb complex. When P-TEFb is released from 7SK RNA to activate RNA Polymerase II transcription elongation, these hairpin regions are covered by different heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) of distinct compositions, what is thought to provide a pool of inactive 7SK RNA (26–28). Loop 2 of the 7SK RNA is neither required nor involved in P-TEFb, MePCE or LARP7 interactions. A crucial question remains with respect to the regulation of this 7SK-dependent inactivation process. 7SK RNA, as a RNA Polymerase III transcribed gene, is thought to be expressed at robust and constant levels through most phases of the cell cycle and in most embryonic and adult tissues (29). While 7SK RNA may serve as a buffer to fine-tune P-TEFb to constant activity, it is conceivable that 7SK RNA transcription itself or the stability, localization and availability of the RNA are more tightly controlled by yet unidentified mechanisms. In this respect, the finding that P-TEFb inhibition is not sufficient to explain the physiological relevance of 7SK RNA is of great importance. A knockdown of 7SK RNA in HeLa cells identified P-TEFb-independent regulatory phenomena (30). When 7SK RNA concentrations are diminished to less than 5%, P-TEFb target genes are expressed at a higher rate, as expected due to the higher processivity of the RNA Polymerase II apparatus. But also gene-expression not regulated by P-TEFb or even expression from minimal, plasmid-coded promoters is both positively and negatively altered with changing intracellular concentrations of 7SK RNA. These observations clearly point to a yet unidentified second function in transcription regulation exerted by the 7SK snRNA. We therefore set out to identify additional 7SK interacting proteins in an effort to unveil such P-TEFb-independent mechanism of gene regulation. We thereby used the loop 2 substructure of 7SK RNA (Figure 1A) as a bait, as this is the only substructure not involved in P-TEFb, MePCE or LARP7 binding. We report that the chromatin factor and transcription regulatory hub HMGA1 is bound by 7SK RNA, which in turn affects its DNA binding and regulatory activities for over 1500 target genes.

Transfections were either performed by the calciumphosphate coprecipitation method (32) or by FugeneHD (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EXTRACT PREPARATIONS. The preparation of nuclear extract and total cellular extract was performed as described previously (33). To obtain extracts for co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were reconstituted in isotonic IP-lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1% TRITON™ X-100, protease inhibitor) and homogenized in a dounce-homogenizer before cellular debris was removed by high speed centrifugation (16.000g).

21147767,"The structure and interactions of SpoIISA and SpoIISB, a toxin-antitoxin system in Bacillus subtilis. INTRODUCTION. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules encoding a stable killer protein and a labile protein antidote were originally discovered through their association with the phenomenon of plasmid maintenance in bacteria (1, 2). In these systems, the toxin component has a longer cellular half-life than the antitoxin so that the host becomes addicted to the continuous expression of the antitoxin, and plasmid retention is driven by post-segregational cell killing. TA systems were subsequently found to be encoded on bacterial genomes where their biological function and physiological role have been the subject of widespread discussion and speculation (3–5). According to one line of thought, subpopulations of cells undergo altruistic toxin-mediated cell death for the benefit of the population as a whole. This might be a mechanism to contain the spread of phage infection or, under starvation conditions, to provide food for the survivors. A more widely accepted idea is that TA toxins induce a state of bacteriostasis rather than cell killing, enabling cells to survive temporary bouts of adversity such as starvation or to persist through exposure to antibiotics. In support of this idea is the observation that the actions of some toxins can be reversed by later expression of the antitoxin (6) and the finding that TA systems are most prevalent in organisms that are associated with slow growth and dormancy (4). SpoIISA-SpoIISB is a chromosomally encoded TA system in Bacillus subtilis discovered as part of a study of cell differentiation in this organism. In sporulation, the cell division septum forms not at mid-cell as during vegetative growth but instead at a polar location dividing the cell into two compartments of unequal size: a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore. The two cells follow different patterns of gene expression orchestrated by cell type- and stage-specific RNA polymerase sigma factors. The mother cell goes on to engulf the forespore and nurture the latter as it matures into a resistant spore that is released upon mother cell autolysis. The spoIISAB operon was discovered following a screen for B. subtilis mutants in which sporulation is blocked after the formation of the polar septum (7). Inactivation of spoIISB decreases the sporulation efficiency of wild type cells by 4 orders of magnitude, whereas inactivation of spoIISA in the same background has no effect on sporulation. In contrast, spoIISA inactivation in a spoIISB null mutant background fully restores sporulation, indicating that SpoIISB is required only to counteract the negative effect of SpoIISA on sporulation (7). Cells synthesizing SpoIISA in the absence of SpoIISB exhibit lethal damage of their cell envelopes shortly after asymmetric septation. It appears that the SpoIIS proteins are normally expressed in the mother cell because the defects associated with spoIISB deletion are corrected when SpoIISB is synthesized in the mother cell but not if it is synthesized in the forespore. Forced expression of SpoIISA in exponentially growing cells or in the forespore compartment during sporulation leads to similar morphological defects and cell death. Again protection is conferred by simultaneous synthesis of SpoIISB. These observations led to the conclusions that SpoIISA is a cell killer protein and that SpoIISB is its specific antidote (7). TA systems, which have widespread distribution, have been grouped into families, with prominent examples being the CcdA-CcdB, HigB-HigA, MazE-MazF, ParD-ParE, PhD-Doc, RelB-RelE, VapB-VapC, and YoeB-YefM families (4) with new members continuing to emerge. SpoIISA-SpoIISB appears to define a new family of TA systems that is conserved among Bacilli. spoIISA encodes a 248-residue protein containing three putative transmembrane segments at its N terminus with the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein predicted to be located in the cytoplasm (7). The full-length protein is required for cell killing because neither the transmembrane domain nor the cytoplasmic domain, when expressed alone, are toxic. spoIISB encodes a basic hydrophilic protein of 56 amino acid residues, and neither SpoIISA nor SpoIISB has significant sequence similarity to proteins of known structure or function. As a step toward elucidating the biological role of the SpoIIS proteins and the mechanisms by which (i) SpoIISA mediates toxicity and (ii) this toxicity is overcome by SpoIISB, we describe here the characterization and structure of the complex between the cytoplasmic domain of SpoIISA and SpoIISB.

Unless otherwise indicated, Escherichia coli and B. subtilis cultures were grown in LB medium (8). Transformation of B. subtilis and assays of sporulation efficiency were performed as described previously (9). Sporulation was induced by nutrient exhaustion in liquid Difco sporulation medium. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, aliquots of the culture were serially diluted and plated on to LB plates before and after a 15-min incubation at 85 °C. The sporulation efficiency was defined in terms of colony-forming units. CONSTRUCTION OF PLASMIDS AND BACTERIAL STRAINS. All of the PCR primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. Unless otherwise indicated, chromosomal DNA isolated from B. subtilis strain PY79 was used as a PCR template.

21207454,"The N(0)-binding region of the vesicular stomatitis virus phosphoprotein is globally disordered but contains transient α-helices. The phosphoprotein (P) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) interacts with nascent nucleoprotein (N), forming the N(0)-P complex that is indispensable for the correct encapsidation of newly synthesized viral RNA genome. In this complex, the N-terminal region (P(NTR)) of P prevents N from binding to cellular RNA and keeps it available for encapsidating viral RNA genomes. Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we show that an isolated peptide corresponding to the 60 first N-terminal residues of VSV P (P(60)) and encompassing P(NTR) has overall molecular dimensions and a dynamic behavior characteristic of a disordered protein but transiently populates conformers containing α-helices. The modeling of P(60) as a conformational ensemble by the ensemble optimization method using SAXS data correctly reproduces the α-helical content detected by NMR spectroscopy and suggests the coexistence of subensembles of different compactness. The populations and overall dimensions of these subensembles are affected by the addition of stabilizing (1M trimethylamine-N-oxide) or destabilizing (6M guanidinium chloride) cosolvents. Our results are interpreted in the context of a scenario whereby VSV P(NTR) constitutes a molecular recognition element undergoing a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to its partner when forming the N(0)-P complex.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2570,pos_MEDLINE,0.9979771,1
21211513,"A combined quantum chemical and crystallographic study on the oxidized binuclear center of cytochrome c oxidase. Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain. By reducing oxygen to water, it generates a proton gradient across the mitochondrial or bacterial membrane. Recently, two independent X-ray crystallographic studies ((Aoyama et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 106 (2009) 2165-2169) and (Koepke et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1787 (2009) 635-645)), suggested that a peroxide dianion might be bound to the active site of oxidized CcO. We have investigated this hypothesis by combining quantum chemical calculations with a re-refinement of the X-ray crystallographic data and optical spectroscopic measurements. Our data suggest that dianionic peroxide, superoxide, and dioxygen all form a similar superoxide species when inserted into a fully oxidized ferric/cupric binuclear site (BNC). We argue that stable peroxides are unlikely to be confined within the oxidized BNC since that would be expected to lead to bond splitting and formation of the catalytic P intermediate. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that binding of dioxygen to the oxidized binuclear site is weakly exergonic, and hence, the observed structure might have resulted from dioxygen itself or from superoxide generated from O(2) by the X-ray beam. We show that the presence of O(2) is consistent with the X-ray data. We also discuss how other structures, such as a mixture of the aqueous species (H(2)O+OH(-) and H(2)O) and chloride fit the experimental data.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2571,pos_MEDLINE,0.8502201,1
21211726,"Disorder targets misorder in nuclear quality control degradation: a disordered ubiquitin ligase directly recognizes its misfolded substrates. SUMMARY. Protein quality control (PQC) degradation systems protect the cell from the toxic accumulation of misfolded proteins. Because any protein can become misfolded, these systems must be able to distinguish abnormal proteins from normal ones, yet be capable of recognizing the wide variety of distinctly shaped misfolded proteins they are likely to encounter. How individual PQC degradation systems accomplish this remains an open question. Here we show that the yeast nuclear PQC ubiquitin ligase San1 directly recognizes its misfolded substrates via intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal domains. These disordered domains are punctuated with small segments of order and high sequence conservation that serve as substrate-recognition sites San1 uses to target its different substrates. We propose that these substrate-recognition sites, interspersed among flexible, disordered regions, provide San1 an inherent plasticity that allows it to bind its many, differently shaped misfolded substrates. INTRODUCTION. Correct folding of proteins is essential for normal cellular physiology. When folding goes awry, misfolded proteins can acquire toxic aggregation-prone states that lead to cellular dysfunction. This presents an ongoing challenge for the cell because of the continuous stochastic production of misfolded proteins through synthesis errors, environmental stresses, and damage by reactive metabolites. Genetic mutations can also cause structural aberrancies, creating misfolded mutant proteins with a propensity for aggregation and cellular toxicity. Protein aggregation has been linked to >35 human disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Skovronsky et al., 2006). Interestingly, most aggregation disorders are associated with toxic accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins in the nucleus (Woulfe, 2007), suggesting the nucleus may be particularly susceptible to the effects of misfolded proteins. However, we know little about how the cell normally prevents nuclear accumulation of misfolded proteins. One of the main ways the cell manages misfolded proteins is through Protein Quality Control (PQC) degradation. A key aspect of PQC degradation systems is that they must be able to distinguish abnormally folded proteins from normal ones. This presents a problem for the PQC degradation systems in that any protein can become misfolded and will do so in ways distinct from other proteins. Yet, each distinctly misfolded protein must be recognized by a limited set of PQC degradation systems. How PQC degradation systems broadly recognize their variant misfolded substrates has been a longstanding question in PQC degradation. Studies of PQC degradation in the cytoplasm and ER have shed some light on this question. In the mammalian cytoplasm, the ubiquitin ligase CHIP interacts with Hsp70 chaperones and ubiquitinates Hsp70 client proteins that cannot be properly folded (McDonough and Patterson, 2003). In the yeast cytoplasm, PQC degradation mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1 uses Hsp70 and Hsp110 chaperones (Heck et al., 2010; Nillegoda et al., 2010), though the role of the chaperones in substrate selection is not yet clear. In the yeast ER, different ubiquitin ligase complexes target abnormal proteins based on where the structural lesion manifests itself in relation to the ER membrane. The ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 ubiquitinates proteins with structural lesions in luminal or membrane domains whereas the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 ubiquitinates proteins with structural lesions in cytoplasmic domains (Vembar and Brodsky, 2008). Hrd1 uses its partner Hrd3, the ER chaperone Kar2, and the lectin Yos9 for luminal substrate recognition (Carvalho et al., 2006; Denic et al., 2006; Gauss et al., 2006a; Gauss et al., 2006b). Hrd1 also uses its transmembrane domain as a specificity determinant to distinctly recognize different membrane substrates (Sato et al., 2009). Although substrate recognition is less clear in the case of Doa10, cytoplasmic chaperones are involved in some aspects of Doa10-mediated PQC degradation (Metzger et al., 2008). Studies of PQC degradation in the nucleus have also identified ubiquitin ligases that target misfolded proteins. In yeast, the nuclear-localized ubiquitin ligase San1 specifically ubiquitinates abnormal nuclear proteins for proteasome degradation (Gardner et al., 2005). Subsequent studies in mammalian cells have identified potential roles in nuclear PQC degradation for the nuclear ubiquitin ligases PML IV and UHRF-2 (Fu et al., 2005; Iwata et al., 2009; Janer et al., 2006). At this point, the means by which nuclear PQC ligases target their substrates is not known. To understand substrate selection in nuclear PQC degradation, we focused on how San1 recognizes its substrates. San1 does not contain any known chaperone-binding motifs, although it might bind substrates through other adaptor proteins. Alternatively, San1 might possess one or more domains that directly bind its substrates. Here we report San1 directly targets substrates using highly disordered domains that contain embedded substrate-recognition modules. RESULTS. SAN1 DIRECTLY INTERACTS WITH SUBSTRATES. To understand how San1 interacts with substrates, we first developed a 2-hybrid approach. We previously found that San1 specifically targets the mutant temperature-sensitive proteins Sir4-9, Cdc68-1, and Cdc13-1 for degradation whereas normal Sir4, Cdc68, and Cdc13 are not degraded (Gardner et al., 2005). For the 2-hybrid to report San1's PQC function accurately, San1 must interact with the mutant forms of these proteins and not with the normal forms. To test this, we fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (GBD) a ubiquitination-deficient version of San1, which contains the C279S substitution in the RING domain (Gardner et al., 2005). We also fused the Gal4 activation domain (GAD) to either normal or mutant Sir4, Cdc68, and Cdc13. The GAD fusions were coexpressed with GBD-San1C",PMC,pos,1,pos,2572,pos_PMC,0.99566853,1

MSL1 interacts with MSL3 as an extended chain forming an extensive hydrophobic interface, whereas the MSL1-MOF interface involves electrostatic interactions between the HAT domain and a long helix of MSL1. This structure provides insights into the catalytic mechanism of MOF and enables us to show analogous interactions of MOF with NSL1. In Drosophila, selective disruption of Msl1 interactions with Msl3 or Mof severely affects Msl1 targeting to the body of dosage-compensated genes and several high-affinity sites, without affecting promoter binding.

PDZ domains are protein interaction domains that are found in cytoplasmic proteins involved in signaling pathways and subcellular transport. Their roles in the control of cell growth, cell polarity, and cell adhesion in response to cell contact render this family of proteins targets during the development of cancer. Targeting of these network hubs by the oncoprotein E6 of ""high-risk"" human papillomaviruses (HPVs) serves to effect the efficient disruption of cellular processes. Using NMR, we have solved the three-dimensional solution structure of an extended construct of the second PDZ domain of MAGI-1 (MAGI-1 PDZ1) alone and bound to a peptide derived from the C-terminus of HPV16 E6, and we have characterized the changes in backbone dynamics and hydrogen bonding that occur upon binding. The binding event induces quenching of high-frequency motions in the C-terminal tail of the PDZ domain, which contacts the peptide upstream of the canonical X-[T/S]-X-[L/V] binding motif. Mutations designed in the C-terminal flanking region of the PDZ domain resulted in a significant decrease in binding affinity for E6 peptides. This detailed analysis supports the notion of a global response of the PDZ domain to the binding event, with effects propagated to distal sites, and reveals unexpected roles for the sequences flanking the canonical PDZ domain boundaries.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2576,pos_MEDLINE,0.9979771,1

21242430,"Preoperative magnetic resonance angiography detection of septocutaneous perforators in fibula free flap transfer. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether preoperative magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is predictive of surgical findings in fibula free flap surgery for head and neck reconstruction. METHODS Retrospective review (April 2004 until September 2009) of 123 patients who underwent preoperative MRA as part of surgical planning for fibula free flap tissue transfer for head and neck reconstruction. Each MRA was reviewed by a board-certified radiologist masked to the intraoperative findings and to the number of septocutaneous perforators documented. Operative notes were reviewed and the number of septocutaneous perforators found during the operation was recorded. A κ interrater agreement statistic was calculated to compare these values. RESULTS Two vascular anomalies found during the operation were undetected by MRA. Analysis of the entire cohort demonstrated that agreement between the number of perforators documented on MRA and the number found intraoperatively approached zero (unweighted κ = -0.088, P = .04). The agreement between the 2 values was 17.9% and the average percentage correctly classified was 10.9%. CONCLUSIONS Contrary to previous reports, preoperative MRA does not accurately predict the presence and/or number of skin perforators found intraoperatively for a fibula free flap operation. The surgeon should not be dissuaded from planning a fibula free flap operation if skin perforators appear unfavorable on preoperative MRA because intraoperative observation is definitive. The surgeon should prepare for anomalous cases in which perforators may arise from the posterior tibial system. Further investigation is needed to achieve more accurate imaging modalities for evaluating septocutaneous perforators prior to free fibula flap transfer.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,2578,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0029121786,0
21247903,"Structural basis for selective small molecule kinase inhibition of activated c-Met. The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met is implicated in oncogenesis and is the target for several small molecule and biologic agents in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. Binding of the hepatocyte growth factor to the cell surface receptor of c-Met induces activation via autophosphorylation of the kinase domain. Here we describe the structural basis of c-Met activation upon autophosphorylation and the selective small molecule inhibiton of autophosphorylated c-Met. MK-2461 is a potent c-Met inhibitor that is selective for the phosphorylated state of the enzyme. Compound 1 is an MK-2461 analog with a 20-fold enthalpy-driven preference for the autophosphorylated over unphosphorylated c-Met kinase domain. The crystal structure of the unbound kinase domain phosphorylated at Tyr-1234 and Tyr-1235 shows that activation loop phosphorylation leads to the ejection and disorder of the activation loop and rearrangement of helix αC and the G loop to generate a viable active site. Helix αC adopts a orientation different from that seen in activation loop mutants. The crystal structure of the complex formed by the autophosphorylated c-Met kinase domain and compound 1 reveals a significant induced fit conformational change of the G loop and ordering of the activation loop, explaining the selectivity of compound 1 for the autophosphorylated state. The results highlight the role of structural plasticity within the kinase domain in imparting the specificity of ligand binding and provide the framework for structure-guided design of activated c-Met inhibitors.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2580,pos_MEDLINE,0.9976311,1

Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypurine nucleoside 5'-monophosphates and participates in the regulation of purine nucleotide pools within the cell. It interferes with the phosphorylation-dependent activation of nucleoside analogues used in the treatment of cancer and viral diseases. It is allosterically activated by a number of phosphate-containing cellular metabolites such as ATP, diadenosine polyphosphates, and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which couple its activity with the metabolic state of the cell.

Intrinsic disorder is important for protein regulation, yet its role in regulation of ion transport proteins is essentially uninvestigated. The ubiquitous plasma membrane carrier protein Na(+)/H(+) Exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) plays pivotal roles in cellular pH and volume homeostasis, and its dysfunction is implicated in several clinically important diseases. This study shows, for the first time for any carrier protein, that the distal part of the C-terminal intracellular tail (the cdt, residues V686-Q815) from human (h) NHE1 is intrinsically disordered. Further, we experimentally demonstrated the presence of a similar region of intrinsic disorder (ID) in NHE1 from the teleost fish Pleuronectes americanus (paNHE1), and bioinformatic analysis suggested ID to be conserved in the NHE1 family. The sequential variation in structure propensity as determined by NMR, but not the amplitude, was largely conserved between the h- and paNHE1cdt. This suggests that both proteins contain molecular recognition features (MoRFs), i.e., local, transiently formed structures within an ID region. The functional relevance of the most conserved MoRF was investigated by introducing a point mutation that significantly disrupted the putative binding feature. When this mutant NHE1 was expressed in full length NHE1 in AP1 cells, it exhibited impaired trafficking to the plasma membrane.

21464929,"A transient homotypic interaction model for the influenza A virus NS1 protein effector domain. INTRODUCTION. During infection the influenza A virus NS1 protein participates in multiple protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions to perform a plethora of functions (reviewed in [1]). Examples include its ability to act as a potent interferon (IFN) antagonist (both pre- and post- transcriptionally) [2], [3], [4], [5], its inhibition of host antiviral enzymes [6], [7], its enhancing effect on viral translation [8], and its activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling [9]. Approximately 30 cellular and viral factors have been reported to interact either directly or indirectly with NS1, which seems surprising given that NS1 itself is relatively short (only ∼230 amino-acids). However, protein multifunctionality may be a key feature of many small RNA virus replication strategies given that they usually possess a restricted coding capacity. Potential mechanisms that likely influence the functions of NS1 include: (i) post-translational modifications [10], [11], [12]; (ii) strain-specific polymorphisms [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]; and (iii) spatio-temporal distribution [19], [20]. As with many cellular proteins, different multimeric forms may also be an important determinant of specific NS1 functions [21], [22]. The N-terminal 73 amino-acid residues of NS1 form a symmetrical homodimeric RNA-binding domain (RBD) [23], [24], [25], [26], which is connected to the central effector domain (ED; residues 86-204) via an inter-domain linker [27]. The final ∼25 residues of NS1 appear to be unstructured, and are termed the C-terminal flexible ‘tail’ (FT) ( Fig. 1A ) [28]. Both the isolated RBD and ED can homodimerize in solution [26], [28], [29], [30], and both contribute to functional NS1 multimerization during infection [21], [22]. Surprisingly, the recent full-length structure of NS1 revealed that the EDs do not contribute to the overall dimer interface, but instead flank the core dimeric RBDs, thus creating a ‘domain-swapped’ dimer ( Fig. 1A ) [27]. Nevertheless, within the crystal lattice, the EDs formed homotypic contacts with neighboring molecules, thereby confirming that higher-order oligomeric forms of NS1 may occur [27]. The isolated NS1 RBDs of several different influenza A virus isolates all show a very high degree of structural homology and conservation (refs. [24], [26] and PDB IDs 2Z0A & 3M8A). In particular, the mode of RBD dimerization does not vary between strains, and is unaffected by binding double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) [25]. In contrast, several possible ED homodimer interfaces have been proposed based upon crystal structures obtained using NS1 proteins from various strains. Initially, an interface mediated by short β-sheets (strand-strand dimer; residues 88-91) of two NS1 molecules was suggested from the structure of the NS1 ED from mouse-adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) ( Fig. 1B ) [29]. However, later structures of EDs from A/Duck/Alberta/60/76 (Alb/76) [28] and A/Udorn/72 (Ud/72) [30] did not possess this interface; instead dimerization was mediated by homotypic interactions between the long α-helices (residues 170–188) of each ED (helix-helix dimer; Fig. 1B ). Of note, this helix-helix interface was also present within the original PR8 ED structure as an alternative to the strand-strand dimer, but was not deemed relevant based on its small dimerization interface [29]. Nevertheless, mutation of W187, a residue responsible for key reciprocal hydrophobic interactions at the helix-helix interface ( Fig. 1B ), caused the isolated Alb/76 and Ud/72 EDs to behave as monomers, thus providing direct experimental evidence that the helix-helix ED dimer predominates in solution [28], [31]. The precise multimeric state of functional NS1 in a biological context is far from clear. Indeed, there is already circumstantial evidence from structures of the NS1 ED in complex with different cellular binding partners that suggests this domain cannot adopt either strand-strand or helix-helix states when carrying out certain functions ( Fig. 1C ) [32], [33]. In this study we sought to assess the relevance of different ED homodimer interfaces using both biophysical and bioinformatical techniques. Crystallographic uncertainties over protein-protein interfaces have often been resolved by observing the same interface in homologous proteins [34]. To this end, we present several new crystal structure forms of different wild-type dimeric and rationally-designed monomeric NS1 EDs grown under novel conditions, and confirm that the helix-helix ED dimer represents the major dimerization interface for this protein. We also analyze the properties of this weak, transient interface using bioinformatics, functional biochemical assays and a newly characterized monoclonal antibody that is unlikely to recognize the helix-helix dimeric ED. RESULTS. THE HELIX-HELIX DIMER INTERFACE IS CONSERVED AMONG ALL NS1 ED STRUCTURES. The favored dimerization interface of the NS1 ED remains controversial. To date, the isolated EDs of four influenza A virus strains have been examined by x-ray crystallography, giving rise to two proposed homodimer forms: strand-strand and helix-helix ([28], [29], [30] and PDB ID 3M5R) ( Fig. 1B ). In order to examine the possible dimerization arrangements of this domain in more detail, EDs of the divergent mouse-adapted human influenza A virus PR8 and avian influenza A virus Alb/76 were expressed and purified from bacteria. Consistent with previous reports, both EDs were dimeric in solution as determined by gel filtration (data not shown and [28]). The purified EDs were screened for new conditions under which crystallization may occur in addition to those previously characterized. Four novel crystal forms were identified (three for PR8 NS1 ED and one for Alb/76 NS1 ED) and solved by x-ray crystallography using molecular replacement ( Table 1 ). Three of the ED structures contained two molecules of NS1 in the asymmetric unit (PDB IDs 3OA9, 3O9S, and 3O9T), whereas eight monomers were pr",PMC,pos,1,pos,2638,pos_PMC,0.997358,1

Although structural data for its in-plane membrane anchor and domain D1 are available, the structure of domains 2 (D2) and 3 (D3) remain poorly defined. We report here a comparative molecular characterization of the NS5A-D3 domains of the HCV JFH-1 (genotype 2a) and Con1 (genotype 1b) strains. Combining gel filtration, CD, and NMR spectroscopy analyses, we show that NS5A-D3 is natively unfolded. However, NS5A-D3 domains from both JFH-1 and Con1 strains exhibit a propensity to partially fold into an α-helix. NMR analysis identifies two putative α-helices, for which a molecular model could be obtained. The amphipathic nature of the first helix and its conservation in all genotypes suggest that it might correspond to a molecular recognition element and, as such, promote the interaction with relevant biological partner(s). Because mutations conferring resistance to cyclophilin inhibitors have been mapped into NS5A-D3, we also investigated the functional interaction between NS5A-D3 and cyclophilin A (CypA). CypA indeed interacts with NS5A-D3, and this interaction is completely abolished by cyclosporin A.

The solution structures of isolated Arp4 and Arp8 indicate them to be monomeric and the crystal structure of ATP-Arp4 reveals several differences to actin that explain why Arp4 does not form filaments itself. Remarkably, Arp4, assisted by Arp8, influences actin polymerization in vitro and is able to depolymerize actin filaments. Arp4 likely forms a complex with monomeric actin via the barbed end. Our data thus help explaining how nuclear actin is held in a discrete complex within the INO80 chromatin remodeller.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2651,pos_MEDLINE,0.99793327,1

Engrailed 2 is a transcription factor belonging to the class of homeoproteins. These proteins possess a 60-residue DNA binding globular domain and play an important role in the early stages of development. We expressed and purified a 13.4 kDa fragment of Engrailed 2, which comprises a 54-residue N-terminal extension in addition to the homeodomain region. Almost all backbone and side-chain resonances have been assigned. The weak dispersion in the proton dimension of the (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectrum indicates the presence of disordered regions that do not belong to the homeodomain. This work is a first step toward the NMR investigation of the structure and dynamics of Engrailed 2 protein that contains a well-structured globular domain and partially disordered regions.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2656,pos_MEDLINE,0.99758446,1
21533811,"Comparative clinical effectiveness of various 5-HT3 RA antiemetic regimens on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting associated with hospital and emergency department visits in real world practice. INTRODUCTION. Antiemetics including the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists (5-HT3 RAs) have been used predominantly to improve the prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients placed on moderately (MEC) or highly emetogenic (HEC) chemotherapy [1, 2]. Palonosetron (Aloxi®), a newer 5-HT3 RA, was approved in the USA in 2003 for the prevention of acute and delayed CINV in patients with cancer receiving MEC or HEC [3]. Palonosetron is a potent and highly selective 5-HT3 RA with strong binding affinity to the receptor and a longer plasma elimination half-life of about 40 h as compared to the older 5-HT3 RAs [3]. Palonosetron also exhibits allosteric interactions, triggers receptor internalization, differentially inhibits “crosstalk” between NK-1 receptors and 5-HT3 signaling pathways, and exhibits prolonged inhibition of receptor function [4, 5]. Palonosetron is the first and the only agent in the class that is approved for preventing both delayed and acute emesis induced in patients receiving MEC [6, 7]. In four phase III trials, palonosetron was reported to have improved efficacy relative to the older 5-HT3 RAs in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC or HEC [2, 8–10]. Gralla and colleagues evaluated patients randomized to receive single intravenous (i.v.) palonosetron doses of 0.25 or 0.75 mg, or ondansetron (32 mg), before initiating MEC. Palonosetron at 0.25 mg was significantly superior to ondansetron in the prevention of acute and delayed CINV events. Complete response rates were significantly higher for palonosetron-treated patients during the acute phase (81.0% vs. 68.6%), the delayed phase (74.1% vs. 55.1%), and the overall phase (69.3% vs. 50.3%) [8]. In the second MEC trial, Eisenberg et al. reported on a multicenter, double-blind, phase III study in patients who were randomized to receive i.v. palonosetron doses of 0.25 or 0.75 mg, or dolasetron (100 mg) before initiating MEC [9]. Complete response rates were significantly higher for palonosetron during the acute phase (63.0% and 52.9% for 0.25 mg palonosetron and dolasetron, respectively), the delayed phase (54.0% and 38.7%, respectively), and the overall phase (46.0% and 34.0%, respectively). The Aapro et al. study [2] was one of the two phase III trials that studied the efficacy and safety of palonosetron in preventing CINV following HEC. Single-dose palonosetron was found as efficacious as ondansetron in preventing acute CINV. Moreover, palonosetron was significantly more efficacious than ondansetron during the delayed (42.0% vs. 28.6%) and the overall phases (40.7% vs. 25.2%) when patients were pre-treated with dexamethasone [2]. In a second phase III HEC trial carried out in Japan, patients with cancer and treated with HEC were randomly assigned to either single-dose palonosetron (0.75 mg) or granisetron (40 mcg/kg) given 30 min before HEC on day 1. Reported results indicated that when palonosetron was administered with dexamethasone before HEC, it exerted efficacy against CINV which was non-inferior to that of granisetron in the acute phase and better than that of granisetron in the delayed phase, with a comparable safety profile for the two treatments [10]. While the efficacy of palonosetron in preventing CINV events has been well documented in clinical trials, its effectiveness in the real-world clinical practice has not been systematically reported. Hence, the present study was performed with a large claims database to investigate the comparative effectiveness of palonosetron versus other 5-HT3 RAs as prophylaxis for resource-intensive CINV events associated with hospital and/or emergency department (ED) admissions in patients with breast or lung cancer receiving MEC or HEC. The secondary objective was to compare the effectiveness results reported in this study with the efficacy data previously reported in phase III clinical trials. STUDY PATIENTS AND METHODS. The study population was selected from PharMetrics database, which compiles integrated managed care pharmacy and medical claims of over 2 billion inpatient and outpatient transactions from 60 million members nationwide. The study included one cohort of patients diagnosed with breast cancer who received adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide within 4 months after surgery. The other two cohorts included patients diagnosed with lung cancer who were initiated on either carboplatin or cisplatin-based chemotherapy within the study time frame (January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2008). Figures 1 and 2 depict the selection process for patients with breast cancer and lung cancer. Based on doses used and/or the published literature, the breast cancer and the carboplatin-treated lung cancer cohorts were considered MEC-treated. The cisplatin-treated lung cancer cohort was considered as HEC-treated. The study index date was defined as the date of breast cancer diagnosis for the breast cancer cohort or the first date of chemotherapy with carboplatin/cisplatin for the lung cancer cohorts. The index chemotherapy was the first chemotherapy treatment cycle, while the index chemotherapy date was marked as the first date of the index chemotherapy. Patients with breast cancer were identified using the International Classification of Diseases-Clinical Modification, 9th Revision (ICD-9-CM) codes (174.xx), while those with lung cancer were identified by ICD-9-CM codes of 162.xx. National Drug Codes and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes were used to identify chemotherapeutic agents. Selected patients were ≥18 years of age with records of claims for ≥6 months prior to study index date. Patients who received cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, or cisplatin within 6 months prior to index chemotherapy were excluded. Additional inclusion criteria consisted of no prior history of vomiting, nausea, or dehydration identified by ICD-9-CM codes for 6 months prior to the index chemotherapy date and t",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,2662,far_neg_PMC,0.002828336,0
21533873,"Proteomic profiling of lipid rafts in a human breast cancer model of tumorigenic progression. INTRODUCTION. The plasma membrane is comprised of numerous of species of glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, triglyceride variants, fatty acid and sterol-based structures, as well as integral proteins. Order arises from this highly complex environment in the form of demixing into two observed ‘phases’, liquid disordered (Ld) and liquid ordered (Lo) [1,2]. A high degree of lateral diffusion occurs within the liquid disordered phase. The liquid ordered domains, referred to as rafts, result from alignment of the rigid planar sterol rings of cholesterol with the long and highly saturated hydrocarbon chains of sphingolipids. Rafts are highly dynamic structures that may coalesce or disperse depending on specific lipid-lipid, lipid-protein, or protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, rafts are heterogeneous with respect to the types of proteins they harbor. Caveolae, a subclass of rafts, contain at least 15 caveolin molecules which form flask-like invaginations of the plasma membrane. Other rafts are specialized for apoptotic signaling by sequestering FAS, FASL and members of the DISC complex. Proteins carrying mostly saturated unbranched lipid modifications, such as acyl or glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) groups, readily partition into the liquid ordered domain. Lipid rafts participate in a wide variety of cellular activities, including receptor signaling, molecular transport across the membrane, and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. They provide a platform for coordinating the interaction of groups of proteins, including receptors and effectors involved in signal transduction [3,4]. Numerous transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors including adrenergic, muscarinic, opiod, angiotensin and bradykinin receptors as well as receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, IR, PDGFR and VEGFR have been identified in rafts. Signaling molecules that are typically associated with the inner layer of the plasma membrane such as G-proteins, adenyl cyclases, PKA, PKC, MAPKs, SRC family members and eNOS have also been localized to lipid rafts. The close association of so many proteins involved in signal transduction within the lipid raft compartment indicates that rafts are important functional structures within cells. By extension, disease processes that result in aberrant signaling would be expected to result in observable changes in the protein composition of rafts. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic identification and quantitation can provide a snapshot of the lipid raft microenvironment and insight into disease processes. As a tumor cell population evolves, signaling networks that regulate normal cell growth, development and apoptosis become altered in favor of increased clonal expansion. Although this evolution is unique from patient to patient, morphologically changes often occur sequentially. For human breast carcinomas these changes entail progression from normal epithelium to benign hyperplasia to atypical hyperplasia to carcinoma in situ and eventually to fully malignant invasive tumors with high metastatic potential. MCF10A cells have been used as a progenitor line from which a series of cell lines have been developed that partially replicate these classifications [5-8]. MCF10A is a spontaneously immortalized non-transformed mammary epithelial cell line derived from a women with benign fibrocystic disease [5]. When xenotransplanted into nude mice, MCF10AT cells form nonproliferative xenograft lesions that appear benign, but sporadically progress to tumors [6], and MCF10ATG3B frequently progress to atypical hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) [7]. Fully malignant MCF10CA1a cells give rise to rapidly growing tumors with 100% efficiency and form lung metastases following intravenous injection [8]. Although there are limitations in any model system, the use of the MCF10A series has the advantage of the ability to perform replicate proteomic analyses on isogenic cells. In this study, we investigated changes in the lipid raft proteomes isolated from four cell lines in the MCF10A lineage that model breast cancer progression. Our hypothesis was that cells with different degrees of tumorigenicity should present unique lipid raft protein profiles. To this end, detergent-resistant membranes were isolated from each cell line, and proteins were digested and labeled with one of four unique isobaric tags. The iTRAQ-labeled peptides were combined and then proteins were identified and quantitated using tandem mass spectrometry. 49 proteins were identified with enough information for semi-quantitative analysis. Proteomic results were verified on a subset of these proteins using immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. For some of the proteins identified in lipid rafts, the change in expression level of the protein in the whole cell was similar to the change in abundance observed in the lipid rafts. This was not the case for other proteins indicating that there are biological processes specific to the cell lineage that are modulating the composition of the lipid raft proteome. These data suggest that the dynamic processes regulating protein association with lipid rafts may have an important role in mammary tumorigenesis, and that subcellular localization of proteins needs to be considered when evaluating cancer biomarkers. METHODS. CELL LINES AND CULTURE CONDITIONS. Cells in the MCF10A cell lineage were obtained from Dr. Fred Miller at the Karmanos Cancer Institute (Detroit, MI, USA). MCF10A cells (10A) are spontaneously immortalized breast epithelial cells obtained from a women with fribrocystic breast disease [5]. MCF10AT cells (AT) were generated by stably transfecting a mutated T24 Ha-ras gene into MCF10A cells [6]. When implanted subcutaneously into nude mice, about 25% of the animals develop carcinomas. MCF10ATG3B cells (TG3B) were generated by transplantation of AT cells into nude/beige mice and re-establishment in culture three times [7].

21552258,"Structure of C3PO and mechanism of human RISC activation. INTRODUCTION. RNA interference (RNAi) describes a variety of evolutionarily conserved double-stranded (ds)RNA-initiated gene silencing mechanisms1–4. The canonical form of RNAi is initiated by the ribonuclease (RNase) III Dicer that processes long dsRNA into ~21-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNA (siRNA). Although nascent siRNA is a duplex, in an active RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), single-stranded (ss)-siRNA guides the endonuclease Argonaute2 (Ago2) to catalyze sequence-specific cleavage of complementary mRNA5–7. Assembly of RISC consists of loading duplex (guide/passenger) siRNA onto Ago2 and dissociation of the passenger strand from Ago2. In Drosophila melanogaster, Dicer-2 (Dcr-2) and its dsRNA-binding partner R2D2 coordinately recruit duplex siRNA to dAgo2 to promote RISC assembly8–13. The slicer activity of dAgo2 plays a critical role in RISC activation by nicking the passenger strand into 9-nt and 12-nt fragments14–16. Chemical modifications that block passenger cleavage also inhibit RISC activation in Drosophila embryo and S2 cell extracts14,16. In S2 extract lacking dAgo2 activity, RISC assembly, monitored by duplex siRNA unwinding, can only be rescued with wild type, but not catalytic mutant, recombinant dAgo217. In Neurospora crassa, the catalytic mutant qde-2 (homolog of Ago2) strains are defective for duplex siRNA unwinding and RISC activation18. These studies establish that Ago2-mediated passenger cleavage is critical for Drosophila and Neurospora RISC activation. Recombinant Dcr-2-R2D2 and dAgo2 proteins reconstitute a basal level of dsRNA- and duplex siRNA-initiated RISC activity17. This core reconstitution system was used to purify a novel RISC activator from S2 extract named C3PO (component 3 promoter of RISC)17, which consists of two evolutionarily conserved proteins: Translin/TB-RBP (hereafter Translin for simplicity) and TRAX19–21. C3PO is a novel Mg2+-dependent endonuclease that promotes Drosophila RISC activation by removing Ago2-nicked passenger strand17. In Neurospora, a similar function has been proposed for an unrelated exonuclease QIP that degrades QDE-2-nicked duplex siRNA to activate RISC18. Among the four mammalian Ago(1–4) proteins, only Ago2 has the slicer activity and is the most critical for siRNA-mediated gene silencing in vivo5,22. The slicer activity of hAgo2 is required for human RISC activation in crude extract23. Chemical modifications impairing passenger cleavage also attenuate duplex siRNA-initiated RISC activity in vitro and in vivo24. These studies suggest that hAgo2-mediated passenger cleavage also plays a critical role in mammalian RISC activation. An alternative “helicase” model for RISC activation is also proposed as several helicases, such as MOV10 and RNA helicase A (RHA), have been genetically implicated in the human RNAi pathway 25–27. The lack of a robust reconstitution system prevents a clear understanding of the mechanisms of human RISC activation. Neither immunoprecipitated nor recombinant human complex containing Dicer-TRBP (homolog of R2D2) and hAgo2 can catalyze duplex siRNA-initiated RISC activity28–30. Although these systems appeared to reconstitute precursor microRNA (pre-miRNA)-initiated RISC activity28–30, recent studies suggested that this initial observation probably reflected ssRNA-initiated RISC activity as recombinant hAgo2 alone could use intact pre-miRNA as a guide for target mRNA cleavage23,31. Here, we have developed a new reconstitution system for duplex siRNA-initiated human RISC activity using Ago2 and C3PO as the core constituents. Moreover, we have solved the X-ray crystal structure of hC3PO, which reveals an asymmetric octamer complex containing six Translin and two TRAX subunits. The structural and biochemical studies provide important insight into the catalytic mechanism of C3PO and its conserved role in human RISC activation. RESULTS. PURIFICATION OF C3PO AS A KEY ACTIVATOR OF HUMAN RISC. To reconstitute human RISC activity, we generated polyhistidine (His)-tagged Dicer-TRBP and hAgo2 recombinant proteins using an insect cell expression system (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Unlike dAgo2, recombinant hAgo2 displayed potent ss-siRNA-initiated RISC activity (Supplementary Fig. 1b). This distinct feature of hAgo2 presented a problem for the reconstitution study due to background activity resulting from ss-siRNA present in synthetic duplex siRNA (Supplementary Fig. 1c). We could eliminate this background activity by using duplex siRNA prepared with excess (1.5-fold) passenger strand relative to the guide strand (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Recombinant Dicer-TRBP and hAgo2 could not reconstitute duplex siRNA-initiated RISC activity (Supplementary Fig. 1d), suggesting that other factors are required for human RISC activation. To identify activators of human RISC, we took an unbiased biochemical approach by supplementing recombinant hAgo2 with chromatographic fractions of HeLa extract to reconstitute duplex siRNA-initiated RISC activity. A robust RISC-activating activity was observed in the Q30 fraction (0.3 M salt elution of Q-Sepharose column) of HeLa extract (Supplementary Fig. 1e), which was purified to near homogeneity through a seven-step chromatographic procedure. Two proteins, ~25 kD and ~35 kD, which closely correlated with the RISC-activating activity, were identified as Translin and TRAX by mass spectrometric analysis (Fig. 1a). Since this complex was previously purified from S2 extract as a RISC activator17, we will refer to human Translin/TRAX complex herein as hC3PO similar to the fly system. The unbiased biochemical purification identified hC3PO as the predominant, if not the only, RISC activator from HeLa extract. RECONSTITUTION OF HUMAN RISC ACTIVITY. Recombinant human Ago2 and C3PO proteins could efficiently reconstitute duplex siRNA-initiated RISC activity in the absence of Dicer-TRBP complex (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2a). In this system, the RISC activity was abolished when using a catal",PMC,pos,1,pos,2673,pos_PMC,0.9969066,1

21620716,"The structure of neurexin 1α reveals features promoting a role as synaptic organizer. SUMMARY. α-Neurexins are essential synaptic adhesion molecules implicated in autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. The α-neurexin extracellular domain consists of 6 LNS domains interspersed by 3 EGF-like repeats and interacts with many different proteins in the synaptic cleft. To understand how α-neurexins might function as synaptic organizers, we solved the structure of the neurexin 1α extracellular domain (n1α) to 2.65 Å. The L-shaped molecule can be divided into a flexible repeat I (LNS1-EGF-A-LNS2), a rigid horseshoe-shaped repeat II (LNS3-EGF-B-LNS4) with structural similarity to so-called reelin repeats, and an extended repeat III (LNS5-EGF-B-LNS6) with controlled flexibility. A 2.95 Å structure of n1α carrying splice insert SS#3 in LNS4 reveals that SS#3 protrudes as a loop and does not alter the rigid arrangement of repeat II. The global architecture imposed by conserved structural features enables α-neurexins to recruit and organize proteins in distinct and variable ways, influenced by splicing, thereby promoting synaptic function. INTRODUCTION. Neurexins are synaptic adhesion molecules recently implicated in neuro-psychiatric diseases including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ) (Südhof 2008, Betancur et al. 2009). Neurexins are located predominantly on the pre-synaptic membrane. Their extracellular domains interact with different proteins in the synaptic cleft, while their cytoplasmic tails interact with the pre-synaptic exocytotic machinery. Neurexins play a role in synapse maturation by fine-tuning synaptic properties and regulate synaptic transmission through a ‘trans-synaptic dialog’ (Südhof 2008, Missler et al. 2003, Kattenstroth et al. 2004, Zhang et al. 2005, Chubykin et al. 2007). When levels of neurexin 1α (or their ligands neuroligins and LRRTMs) are manipulated in animal models, excitatory and inhibitory transmission is altered, a balance that is thought to be disrupted in vivo in many neuro-psychiatric diseases (Missler et al. 2003, Kattenstroth et al. 2004, Levinson et al. 2005, Varoqueaux et al. 2006, Chubykin et al. 2007, Tabuchi et al. 2007, Hines et al. 2008, Gibson et al. 2009, Etherton et al. 2009, de Wit et al. 2009, Dahlhaus et al. 2010, Blundell et al. 2010). Manipulating levels of neurexins and their ligands in animal models also replicates many of the behavioral alterations seen in humans with ASD and SZ (Beglopoulos et al. 2005, Tabuchi et al. 2007, Hines et al. 2008, Jamain et al. 2008, Blundell et al. 2009, Etherton et al. 2009, Blundell et al. 2010, Dahlhaus et al. 2010). Neurexins and their protein partners are now believed to be central components of a synaptic protein network, which underlies a common biological pathway disrupted in many neuro-psychiatric disorders (Guilmatre 2009). The extracellular domain of neurexin 1α (n1α) is composed of three neurexin repeats (I, II and III), which each contain the modules LNS-EGF-LNS (Fig. 1a). N1α binds endogenous ligands including neuroligins, LRRTM family members, neurexophilin, α-dystroglycan and GABAA-receptors (Südhof 2008, Ko et al. 2009a, de Wit et al. 2009, Zhang et al. 2010, Siddiqui et al. 2010). α-Neurexins also regulate the functionality of certain Ca2+-channels, though direct association has not been demonstrated (Missler et al. 2003, Zhang et al. 2005). Recent studies suggest that other, as yet unidentified, proteins interact with α-neurexins as well (Ko et al. 2009b). Neurexins are structurally and functionally diversified through alternative splicing of their mRNAs (Fig. 1a). Potentially, thousands of different neurexin splice forms are produced with different protein partner binding profiles, generating a diverse portfolio of synaptic organizers. N1α LNS domains contain two β-sheets stacked as a β-sandwich in a jelly-roll fold (Sheckler et al. 2006, Shen et al. 2008) (Fig. 1a). A functional region called the ‘hyper-variable surface’ is formed by loops that carry splice inserts SS#2, SS#3, and SS#4 and encompasses a Ca2+-binding site (experimentally shown for L2, L4, and L6) (Rudenko et al. 1999, Sheckler et al. 2006, Shen et al. 2008) (Fig. 1a). Some, but not all, protein partners interact with the ‘hyper-variable surfaces’. Crystal structures show that neuroligins bind to the hyper-variable surface of the LNS domain in n1β (identical to n1α L6) by sandwiching the central Ca2+-binding site between the two proteins (Araç et al. 2007, Fabrichny et al. 2007, Chen et al. 2008, Leone et al. 2010). LRRTM proteins compete with neuroligins to bind n1β, suggesting that they share overlapping binding sites (Ko et al. 2009a, Siddiqui et al. 2010). α-Dystroglycan binds the hyper-variable surface of L2 and its association is disrupted by destroying the Ca2+-binding site; α-dystroglycan also binds to the hyper-variable surface of L6 and is competed by exogenous α-latrotoxin, another ligand for L6 (Sugita et al. 2001). Single LNS domains can support ligand binding; binding of some, but not all, protein partners is regulated by alternative splice inserts and requires Ca2+. While isolated neurexin LNS domains have been extensively characterized, high resolution information on their arrangement in the full-length n1α extracellular domain is not known, though a recent study using electron microscopy has revealed a low resolution model of n1α (Comoletti et al. 2010). The global organization and conformational freedom between modules in the ectodomain of α-neurexins likely determines the ability of this family of proteins to organize protein partners in the synaptic cleft. To gain insight into n1α structure-function relationships, we solved the structure of bovine n1α by x-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.65 Å and n1α+SS#3 to 2.95 Å. The crystal structure of n1α reveals an L-shaped molecule. The modules are tethered together in flexible and rigid arrangements encoded by characteristic structural features.

21642970,"Structure-function studies of FMRP RGG peptide recognition of an RNA duplex-quadruplex junction. The regulation of gene expression by interactions between nucleic acid-binding proteins and G-quadruplexes is an area of intense interest. Bioinformatic analyses have predicted that there are potentially over 350,000 G-quadruplex-forming sequences in the human genome, and recent studies of RNA G-quadruplexes in the transcriptome predict that they may be even more extensive than previously appreciated. Functionally, G-quadruplex structures in RNA have been implicated in almost all aspects of pre-mRNA and mRNA metabolism including mRNA stability, IRES-dependent translation initiation, translational repression, alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation/3´ end formation suggesting that the G-quadruplex may be an important regulatory motif in many aspects of gene expression. The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is a regulatory RNA binding protein that binds with high affinity to guanine-rich RNAs capable of G-quadruplex formation. Loss of FMRP function leads to the Fragile X Syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation, afflicting 1 in 2500 males, and is the leading single-gene cause of autism. The Fragile X Syndrome almost always results from a triplet repeat expansion in the 5’-UTR, leading to abnormal methylation of the gene, repression of transcription, and hence complete loss of FMRP expression. However, one severely affected patient harbors a missense mutation in one of the RNA binding domains, and mice harboring this mutation are indistinguishable from FMRP null mice in most behavioral and electrophysiologic assays and macroorchidism, suggesting that loss of RNA binding activity may underlie the synaptic dysfunction observed in the disease. Recent evidence suggests that FMRP functions to repress mRNA translation in neurons, leading to the widely held view that Fragile X Syndrome is a disease of “runaway translation” resulting in inappropriate gene expression with dire consequences for synaptic plasticity. This occurs despite the presence of two autosomal paralogs, FXR1P and FXR2P, which are also expressed in the brain. While all three proteins share a great deal of homology in their N-termini, KH domains and nuclear export signal, the C-termini containing the RGG box have diverged considerably. Consequently, the KH domains share RNA binding specificity but binding to G-rich sequences capable of forming G-quadruplexes is specific to FMRP. These observations, together with interest in identifying the in vivo RNA ligands of FMRP suggest that understanding the role of the RGG box - G-rich RNA interaction will be important in understanding the human disease. Binding of FMRP to G-rich RNAs requires only the RGG box RNA binding domain of FMRP, which is rich in arginines and glycines. In vitro selection identified guanine-rich RNA motifs that can bind tightly to FMRP, such as the 36-nt r(GCUGCGGUGUGGAAGGAGUGGUCGGGUUGCGCAGCG) sequence named sc1. Binding of FMRP to sc1 RNA was shown to depend on G-quadruplex formation based on the following observations: (i) the binding affinity was significantly increased in the presence of K+ as compared to Li+, and (ii) mutations of guanines within G-tracts abolished binding. To understand how G-rich RNAs could be recognized by the RGG domain of FMRP, we used NMR to characterize the 1:1 complex between the 36-nt sc1 RNA sequence with a 28-aa peptide from the RGG domain of FMRP (RGG peptide) (Fig. 1a). We prepared complexes with various RNA and peptide constructs, including unlabeled, uniformly 13C,15N-labeled, as well as residue-type-specific and site-specific 13C,15N-labeled sc1 RNA and RGG peptide molecules. The structure of the complex revealed a number of new motifs and recognition principles between the FMRP RGG peptide and the sc1 RNA duplex-quadruplex junction. Subsequently, the peptide-RNA intermolecular contacts and the contributions of shape complementarity to molecular recognition were validated following analysis of filter binding assays on structure-guided RNA and peptide mutations. RESULTS. BINDING OF FMRP RGG PEPTIDE TO SC1 RNA. NMR spectra of both peptide and RNA in 50 mM K-acetate, pH 6.8 at 25 °C, clearly indicated that the RGG peptide binds to sc1 RNA to form a stable complex. From the peptide side, peak dispersion in the fingerprint region of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the free peptide (Fig. 1b) and RNA-bound peptide (Fig. 1c) revealed a transition from a ‘random coil’ to a well-ordered conformation of the peptide upon RNA binding. From the RNA side, the imino proton spectrum of the RNA in the free state (Fig. 1d) suggested that besides formation of a Watson-Crick duplex stem (indicated by six imino proton peaks between 12 to 14 ppm), the remainder of the molecule either is essentially not well-structured or adopts multiple conformations, as indicated by broad imino protons between 10 and 12 ppm. Upon binding to the RGG peptide, sc1 RNA becomes well-structured as indicated by a sharp and well-resolved imino proton spectrum containing well-dispersed additional resonances (Fig. 1e). Imino proton peaks from 12 to 14 ppm are characteristic of Watson-Crick base pairs, while those from 10 to 12 ppm are characteristic of G-tetrad formation, with eight imino protons between 10–12 ppm exchanging slowly and observed even 16 hours after transfer to D2O solution (Fig. 1f). NMR ASSIGNMENTS OF SC1 RNA IN THE COMPLEX. The imino protons of the FMRP RGG peptide-sc1 RNA complex in K+-containing H2O buffer solution are exceptionally well-dispersed between 10.5 and 14.0 ppm (Fig. 1e; see also 1H-15N HSQC spectrum in Supplementary Fig. 1a). We have unambiguously assigned the guanine imino protons following site-specific incorporation of 2% 15N-labeled deoxyguanine at individual guanine positions in the sc1 RNA sequence.

21676866,"Structure of the 30-kDa Sin3-associated protein (SAP30) in complex with the mammalian Sin3A corepressor and its role in nucleic acid binding. The ∼2-megadalton evolutionarily conserved histone deacetylase-associated Rpd3L/Sin3L complex plays critical roles in altering the histone code and repressing transcription of a broad range of genes involved in many aspects of cellular physiology. Targeting of this complex to specific regions of the genome is presumed to rely on interactions involving one or more of at least 10 distinct subunits in the complex. Here we describe the solution structure of the complex formed by the interacting domains of two constitutively associated subunits, mSin3A and SAP30. The mSin3A paired amphipathic helix 3 (PAH3) domain in the complex adopts the left-handed four-helix bundle structure characteristic of PAH domains. The SAP30 Sin3 interaction domain (SID) binds to PAH3 via a tripartite structural motif, including a C-terminal helix that targets the canonical PAH hydrophobic cleft while two other helices and an N-terminal extension target a discrete surface formed largely by the PAH3 α2, α3, and α3' helices. The protein-protein interface is extensive (∼1400 Å(2)), accounting for the high affinity of the interaction and the constitutive association of the SAP30 subunit with the Rpd3L/Sin3L complex. We further show using NMR that the mSin3A PAH3-SAP30 SID complex can bind to nucleic acids, hinting at a role for a nucleolar localization sequence in the SID αA helix in targeting the Rpd3L/Sin3L complex for silencing ribosomal RNA genes.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2697,pos_MEDLINE,0.9981141,1

Since differences in the virulence of Mycoplasma (M.) hyopneumoniae strains have been described, the isolation of field strains followed by genotypic and phenotypic characterisation has become a major goal in epidemiological studies. The aim of this study was to compare various M. hyopneumoniae isolates from different pig herds and numerous pigs within the same herd. Therefore, pigs of 109 herds located in North-Western Germany were sampled either on-farm or during necropsies. Overall, 52 isolates of M. hyopneumoniae were recovered from 45 pigs originating from 21 herds. The identity of cultures was confirmed by PCR targeting the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region. Typing of isolates was achieved by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis and multi-locus analysis of variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and demonstrated a high degree of heterogeneity of M. hyopneumoniae isolates. Differences among isolates recovered from animals of the same herd or even from the same pig revealed a grouping into different genotypic clusters. This outcome was observed with both methods. It was concluded that more than one strain of M. hyopneumoniae might be present in a pig herd and even in a single pig, suggesting high genetic heterogeneity between isolates of the same epidemiological source. These factors should be considered when applying nucleic amplification techniques for characterising M. hyopneumoniae strains to specify the epidemiology of infection and to evaluate virulence factors triggering the corresponding disease.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,2698,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0058996035,0

Two experiments explored how frequency content impacts sound localization for sounds containing reverberant energy. Virtual sound sources from thirteen lateral angles and four distances were simulated in the frontal horizontal plane using binaural room impulse responses measured in an everyday office. Experiment 1 compared localization judgments for one-octave-wide noise centered at either 750 Hz (low) or 6000 Hz (high). For both band-limited noises, perceived lateral angle varied monotonically with source angle. For frontal sources, perceived locations were similar for low- and high-frequency noise; however, for lateral sources, localization was less accurate for low-frequency noise than for high-frequency noise. With increasing source distance, judgments of both noises became more biased toward the median plane, an effect that was greater for low-frequency noise than for high-frequency noise. In Experiment 2, simultaneous presentation of low- and high-frequency noises yielded performance that was less accurate than that for high-frequency noise, but equal to or better than for low-frequency noise. Results suggest that listeners perceptually weight low-frequency information heavily, even in reverberant conditions where high-frequency stimuli are localized more accurately.

21854986,"Structural linkage between ligand discrimination and receptor activation by type I interferons. SUMMARY. Type I Interferons (IFNs) are important cytokines for innate immunity against viruses and cancer. Sixteen human IFN variants signal through the same cell surface receptors, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, yet they can evoke markedly different physiological effects. The crystal structures of two human type I IFN ternary signaling complexes containing IFNα2 and IFNω reveal recognition modes and heterotrimeric architectures that are unique amongst the cytokine receptor superfamily, but conserved between different type I IFNs. Receptor-ligand cross-reactivity is enabled by conserved receptor-ligand ""anchor-points"" interspersed amongst ligand-specific interactions that ‘tune’ the relative IFN binding affinities, in an apparent extracellular ‘ligand proofreading’ mechanism that modulates biological activity. Functional differences between IFNs are linked to their respective receptor recognition chemistries, in concert with a ligand-induced conformational change in IFNAR1, that collectively control signal initiation and complex stability, ultimately regulating differential STAT phosphorylation profiles, receptor internalization rates, and downstream gene expression patterns. INTRODUCTION. IFNs were the first cytokines discovered more than half a century ago as agents that interfered with viral infection (Borden et al., 2007; Isaacs and Lindenmann, 1957). IFNs have been established as pleiotropic, multifunctional proteins in the early immune response, exhibiting antiproliferative effects on cells, in addition to their strong immunomodulatory and antiviral activities. Due to their potency and diverse biological activities, IFNs are used for the treatment of several human diseases, including hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis and certain types of cancer (Borden et al., 2007). Based on the receptor system that mediates their effects, IFNs are grouped into type I, type II and type III IFNs (Uze et al., 2007). The type I IFNs act on, and are produced by almost every nucleated cell, and comprise 16 members with approximately 20–60% sequence identity: IFNβ, IFNε, IFNκ, IFNω and 12 subtypes of IFNα. IFNα, IFNβ and IFNω are produced by cells exposed to viruses or double-stranded RNA (Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006) and have been shown to possess antitumor activity (Horton et al., 1999; Pestka et al., 2004) as well as protect cells against parasites and bacterial pathogens (Bogdan, 2000). Although similar in their spectrum of activities, IFNβ, IFNω and IFNα subtypes can vary significantly in their potency against different viruses, their antiproliferative activity and their ability to activate cells of the immune system. The mechanism mediating this differential activity and signaling through a common receptor remains controversial (van Boxel-Dezaire et al., 2006). Despite their differential activities and broad range of potencies, all 16 human type I IFNs initiate signaling by binding to the same receptor composed of two subunits called IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Together with the IL-10 family receptors, the IL-20 receptor, IL-22R, IL-22BP, IFNLR1, tissue factor and IFNGR, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 form the class II helical cytokine receptor family (Pestka et al., 2004; Walter, 2004; Zdanov). In common with other class II helical cytokine receptors, the extracellular domain (ECD) of IFNAR2, whose NMR structure has been characterized (Chill et al., 2003), consists of two fibronectin III (FNIII)-like domains (D1 and D2). The ECD of IFNAR1, however, is unique, comprising a tandem array of four FNIII subdomains, designated SD1 to SD4, which arose from gene duplication of the typical two-domain structure (Gaboriaud et al., 1990). The intracellular domains (ICDs) of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are associated with the Janus kinases (Jaks) Tyk2 and Jak1, respectively (Schindler and Plumlee, 2008; van Boxel-Dezaire et al., 2006). Upon ligand binding by the IFNAR chains and formation of the extracellular signaling complex, these tyrosine kinases initiate a phosphorylation cascade principally mediated by STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) activation (Schindler and Plumlee, 2008). Other important signaling pathways activated by type I IFNs include the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and the MAP kinase pathway. Studies of the overlapping, yet differential cellular responses elicited by different members of the type I IFNs (Uze et al., 2007) have suggested that the dynamics of ligand interaction with the receptor subunits plays a key role for regulating cellular response patterns (Jaitin et al., 2006; Jaks et al., 2007; Kalie et al., 2007). There are currently no crystal structures of type I IFN receptor complexes, nor any complete receptor signaling complex in the class II helical cytokine family where structures of binary complexes of ligands (IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-22, IFN-λ) with their high-affinity receptor subunits are known (Bleicher et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2008; Josephson et al., 2001; Miknis et al., 2010; Walter et al., 1995). Here we present structural and functional data that sheds light on how type I IFNs engage their receptor chains, how the receptor system is able to recognize the large number of different ligands, and how the different chemistries of ligand interaction ultimately dictate the stabilities of the receptor complexes, and therefore exert primary control on differential signaling. RESULTS. TYPE I IFNS EXHIBIT DISTINCT SIGNALING AND FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES. We studied IFNs that differed significantly in their biological activities: IFNω, IFNα2, and a mutant of IFNα2, IFNα2(YNS), that was engineered to have higher affinity for IFNAR1 in order to improve its anti-tumor efficacy (Kalie et al., 2007). We tested their relative antiviral and antiproliferative potencies, as well as another type I IFN, IFNα7 (Figures 1A, 1B, and S5). The EC50 values in a hepatitis C replication assay showed a 2- to 6-fold differences between the IFNs (IFNα7: 36 fM, IFNω: 37 fM, IFNα2(YNS): 20 fM, IFNα2(wt): 116 fM) (Figure 1A),",PMC,pos,1,pos,2746,pos_PMC,0.99632865,1
21871285,"Thirty-year experience with the arterial switch operation. BACKGROUND We evaluated the results of the arterial switch operation (ASO) being performed at our institution for more than 30 years and identified risk factors for mortality and reoperation. METHODS Clinical outcome of 332 consecutive patients with transposition of the great arteries undergoing ASO was retrospectively analyzed, using surgical reports, medical charts, and latest follow-up echocardiography. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and univariable and multivariable binary logistic and Cox regression analyses. RESULTS In-hospital mortality was 11.4%. At 15 years, estimated overall survival was 85.2%, and estimated freedom from reoperation was 74.0%. Cross-clamp time (p=0.001) and absence of the Lecompte maneuver (p=0.001) were identified as independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality, whereas coronary problems during surgery (p=0.009) and postoperative pacemaker implantation (p<0.001) were independent risk factors for late mortality. Independent risk factors for reoperation were higher age at the time of the ASO (p=0.002), presence of arch abnormalities (p<0.001), coronary problems during surgery (p=0.005), and duration of ventilation (p<0.001). At latest echocardiography, moderate or severe neoaortic regurgitation was present in 3.4% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS Overall, 30 years of experience with the ASO shows good survival and event-free survival rates. Coronary transfer problems during surgery were found to be an important risk factor for late mortality and reoperation. However, coronary anatomy other than 1LCx-2R and an intramural course of the left coronary artery or left anterior descending artery were not risk factors for mortality or reoperation.

There are only a few case reports describing Lyme disease presenting with isolated hip involvement. The purpose of this study is to review our experience with primary Lyme arthritis of the hip. METHODS Clinical records at a tertiary children's referral center in a Lyme endemic region were scanned for key words ""Lyme"" and ""hip."" Patients with isolated Lyme disease of the hip were included. Diagnosis was made based on Centers for Disease Control guidelines. Clinical presentation, laboratory evaluation, and treatment information were recorded for eligible patients. RESULTS Eight patients met eligibility criteria with an average age of 9.5 years (3 to 20y). All patients presented with hip pain (8), limp (3), or refusal to bear weight (5). One of 8 patients had a fever >38.5°C. Two of 8 patients had a peripheral white blood cell count >12,500/mm and 3 of 8 patients had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate>40 mm/h. Aspiration was performed on 5 patients, with a median synovial fluid white blood cell of 41,500/mm (21,500 to 73,500/mm).

Large multi-site docking (LMD) proteins of the Gab, IRS, FRS, DOK and Cas families consist of one or two folded N-terminal domains, followed by a predominantly disordered C-terminal extension. Their primary function is to provide a docking platform for signalling molecules (including PI3K, PLC, Grb2, Crk, RasGAP, SHP2) in intracellular signal transmission from activated cell-surface receptors, to which they become coupled.

Tri- and dimethylations of histone H3K9 (H3K9me3/2) and H3K27 (H3K27me3/2), both situated in the ""A-R-Kme-S"" sequence motif, mediate transcriptional repression of distinct genomic regions. H3K9me3/2 mainly governs constitutive heterochromatin formation, while H3K27me3/2 represses key developmental genes. The mechanisms by which histone-modifying enzymes selectively regulate the methylation states of H3K9 and H3K27 are poorly understood. Here we report the crystal structures of the catalytic fragment of UTX/KDM6A, an H3K27me3/2-specific demethylase, in the free and H3 peptide-bound forms. The catalytic jumonji domain binds H3 residues 25-33, recognizing H3R26, H3A29, and H3P30 in a sequence-specific manner, in addition to H3K27me3 in the catalytic pocket. A novel zinc-binding domain, conserved within the KDM6 family, binds residues 17-21 of H3.

22028797,"The solution structure of the N-terminal domain of human tubulin binding cofactor C reveals a platform for tubulin interaction. INTRODUCTION. In recent years, a great effort has been made to elucidate the complex series of events occurring during the α- and β- tubulin folding pathways that lead to the final release of αβ native heterodimers incorporated in microtubules [1], [2]. In mammals, this process is initiated by the cytosolic chaperonin CCT (also known as c-cpn or TriC) binding to the newly synthesised α- and β-tubulin polypeptides [3] assisted by the molecular chaperone protein prefoldin that, after various ATP-hydrolysis-dependent cycles, produces quasi-native tubulin intermediates. In contrast to actin and γ-tubulin that can be completely folded by the exclusive action of chaperonins, the intermediates of α- and β-tubulin need to be further processed to reach their final active conformation, a process that requires a set of five different tubulin binding cofactors (TBCA, TBCB, TBCC, TBCD, and TBCE). TBCB associates with α-tubulin folding intermediates and is then displaced by TBCE. TBCA and TBCD interact in a similar way with quasi-native β-tubulin. An additional tubulin binding cofactor, TBCC [4], is necessary to complete the process by forming a supercomplex with TBCD, β-tubulin, TBCE, and α-tubulin that, following GTP-hydrolysis-dependent cycles, releases the native αβ-tubulin heterodimers. The stimulated hydrolysis of GTP by β-tubulin acts as a switch for the release of native tubulin heterodimers from the supercomplex [5]. The discovery of this pathway has driven much of the effort to the study of the implication of these proteins in the folding/dimerization of tubulin. Recent results have shown that tubulin binding cofactors also participate in the proteostasis of the tubulin dimer through their intrinsic ability to dissociate the tubulin heterodimer [1], [2]. This ability to dissociate the tubulin heterodimer in a controlled way is a mechanism that certain types of cells exploit to regulate key cytoskeletal processes, such as controlling their microtubule densities, or the trimming of the distal microtubule tips at the axonal growth cone terminal in macrophages and neurons respectively. TBCC is probably the least understood tubulin binding cofactor and no reports regarding its function in vivo have been published. TBCC is organized into three different domains (N-term, CARP and C-term) (Fig. 1A). The C-terminal domain constitutes the hallmark of the TBCC protein family and its structure was recently solved by Saito, K. et al. (2007, PDB: 2YUH). This domain shares ∼29% sequence identity over half of the length of Retinitis Pigmentosa 2 protein (RP2) and both proteins stimulate the GTPase activity of native tubulin with the cooperation of TBCD. In contrast to TBCC, RP2 has no tubulin heterodimerization capacity [6]. This domain is also present in TBCCD1 (TBCC-domain containing 1), a protein that localizes at the centrosome and basal bodies of primary and motile cilia, required for centrosome and Golgi Apparatus (GA) positioning in human cells [7], [8]. The TBCC C-terminal domain has a conserved arginine (R262) also present in RP2 (R118) postulated to act as an arginine-finger in the GTP hydrolysis of tubulin in similar manner as the arginine-finger in RasGAP [9]. Like the corresponding mutation in RP patients, substitution of R262 of TBCC abolishes its GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity suggesting a role in regulation of microtubule polymerization in vivo [6]. Although the N-terminal domain is expected to interact with other spectrin-like domains [10], no functional roles have yet been assigned. In this work we have demonstrated that TBCC is found at the centrosome and we have used NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution structure and the interactions with the αβ-tubulin dimer of its N-terminal domain (TBCC N-terminal domain: residues 25–135). RESULTS. TBCC IS FOUND AT THE CENTROSOME. To study TBCC function, we investigated the subcellular distribution of the endogenous protein in HeLa cells with a novel affinity antiserum purified against the human recombinant protein. The primary antibody recognizing human TBCC used was affinity purified as previously described [11] against both, the full length protein (Fig. 1, 2 and 3) or the TBCC N-terminal domain (Fig. 4) to select TBCC N-terminal recognizing immunoglobulins from the antiserum. A commercial anti-TBCC monoclonal antibody (Abnova Corporation) was used to validate the TBCC centrosomal immunostaining pattern. These antibodies recognised a unique protein band corresponding to TBCC in western blots (Fig. 1B). Doubly immunostained cells revealed a dot-like cytoplasmic labelling accompanied by a prominent and irregular centrosomal spot of TBCC (Fig. 2A). A centrosomal immunostaining pattern was also observable in metaphase cells where both spindle poles displayed TBCC accumulation (Fig. 2A right, arrows). We next overexpressed TBCC in order to investigate TBCC subcellular localization. We observed accumulates of this cofactor at spindle pole bodies and occasional multipolar spindles (Fig. 2B). These results match those observed by Hage-Sleiman et al. [12] in MCF7 cells (human mammary adenocarcinoma), where a G2-M phase blockage in TBCC overexpressing cells has been reported. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that TBCC is localised at the centrosome. We compared TBCC colocalization with classical centrosomal markers, such as γ-tubulin (not shown) or Nedd1, and as Fig. 2C (left) shows, TBCC produced an overlapping immunostaining pattern thus supporting our hypothesis. But since centrosomal proteins are typically recognized by colocalization with centrosomal/centriolar markers after microtubular destruction by cold and nocodazole, we destroyed the microtubule cytoskeleton to corroborate the above hypothesis. Fig. 2C (right) shows that TBCC was still detectable at the centrosome of cold and nocodazole treated HeLa cells, partially colocalizing with the centrioles labelled with an anti-acetylated tubulin antibody.

By binding to integrin β cytoplasmic tail via its C-terminal FERM-like domain, kindlin-2 promotes integrin activation. Intriguingly, this activation process depends on the N-terminus of kindlin-2 (K2-N) which precedes the FERM domain. The molecular function of K2-N is unclear. We present the solution structure of K2-N, which displays a ubiquitin fold similar to that observed in kindlin-1. Using chemical shift mapping and mutagenesis, we found that K2-N contains a conserved positively charged surface that binds to membrane enriched with negatively charged phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate. We show that while wild-type kindlin-2 is capable of promoting integrin activation, such ability is significantly reduced for its membrane-binding defective mutant. These data suggest a membrane-binding function of the ubiquitin-like domain of kindlin-2, which is likely common for all kindlins to promote their localization to the plasma membrane and control integrin activation. INTRODUCTION. The binding of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to integrin transmembrane receptors is essential for the adhesion of cells on the ECM and, as a consequence, regulates a variety of cellular responses such as spreading, migration, and differentiation. The ligand binding function of integrins is tightly regulated through an “inside-out” activation mechanism by which the cytoplasmic face of the integrin engages intracellular proteins, which ultimately triggers conformational changes in the ectodomain of the receptor such that it acquires high affinity for ECM ligands (Qin et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2007; Shattil et al., 2010). Over the last two decades, intensive investigations have converged to demonstrate that the mechanism of “inside-out” activation depends on binding of the N-terminal head domain of talin (talin-H) to the integrin β cytoplasmic tail (CT), which disrupts its association with α CT and triggers the conformational transitions in the receptor (Vinogradova et al., 2002, 2004; Kim et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2009). However, quantitative analysis indicated that talin-H alone was insufficient to induce full integrin activation (Ma et al., 2006) and suggested that co-factors may be required for efficient integrin activation (Ma et al., 2007). Studies in cells, mice and human have now demonstrated that the kindlins function as essential regulators of integrin activation (for review, see Moser et al., 2009; Plow et al., 2009). Kindlins, a three member subfamily of FERM (four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin) containing proteins (for review, see Moser et al., 2009; Plow et al., 2009) can dramatically enhance talin-mediated integrin αIIbβ3 activation, supporting their role as co-activators of integrins (Ma et al., 2008; Montanez et al., 2008; Harburger et al., 2009; Malinin et al., 2009; Svensson et al., 2009). Among the three kindlin family members, kindlin-2 is widely expressed and highly concentrated at integrin-rich cell-ECM adhesions (Tu et al., 2003), and its deficiency leads to embryonic lethality in mice and zebrafish (Dowling et al., 2008; Montanez et al., 2008). Although both kindlin-2 and talin-H contain FERM domains, which are homologous, they bind to distinct sites in integrin β3 CT (Shi et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2008; Montanez et al., 2008). Such distinct binding may promote the cooperation of the two molecules to induce a full activation of integrins. Interestingly, in addition to their FERM-like domains, kindlins have distinct N-terminal F0 domains (Shi et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2008; Montanez et al., 2008; Goult et al., 2009). Deletion of this domain dramatically impairs the kindlin-mediated integrin activation, suggesting that it is mechanistically important for the kindlin function (Ma et al., 2008; Harburger et al., 2009; Goult et al., 2009). In this study, we have determined the solution structure of the kindlin-2 F0 domain using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. As expected, it adopts the ubiquitin fold similar to that found in kindlin-1 (Goult et al., 2009). However, further detailed structural comparison and NMR analysis revealed surprisingly a highly conserved and positively charged surface in K2-N, which mediates association with membrane enriched with highly negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate (PIP2), a known regulator of talin activation and integrin signaling (Martel et al., 2001; Goksoy et al., 2008; Saltel et al., 2009; Garcia-Bernal et al., 2009). Structure-based mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that disruption of this F0-mediated membrane binding substantially reduced the ability of kindlin-2 to cooperate with talin in inducing activation of integrin αIIbβ3. These data unravel a novel membrane-targeting function of the N-terminal ubiquitin domain of kindlin-2, which is likely common for promoting localization of kindlins in cells and for their regulation of integrin activation. RESULTS. STRUCTURE OF THE KINDLIN-2 F0 SUBDOMAIN. Multiple constructs were explored for the optimal expression and solubility of kindlin-2 N-terminus containing the F0 subdomain. These constructs included kindlin-2 1-105, 1-134, 1-154, 11-143, and 1-218; among these, 1-105 (termed K2-N hereafter) yielded a highly soluble and stable protein suitable for detailed NMR structural analysis. The superposition of 20 lowest energy structures is shown in Fig 1A (see also Table 1 for structural statistics and Fig S1A for the backbone assignment of excellent HSQC spectrum of K2-N). The structures are well converged except the N-terminal M1-D15 that appears to be highly flexible with few long range NOEs. Fig 1B provides the ribbon representation, which reveals an ubiquitin fold with a long α1 helix packing against a five-stranded β-sheet. A short 310 α2 helix seen in ubiquitin is also present in K2-N sitting on the top of the α/β fold (Fig 1B). The overall bac",PMC,pos,1,pos,2820,pos_PMC,0.9979771,1
22081014,"NSP-Cas protein structures reveal a promiscuous interaction module in cell signaling. INTRODUCTION. The integration of signals triggered by diverse stimuli is essential for cell communication in higher organisms and is primarily achieved through the assembly of multiprotein signaling nodes. The Crk-associated substrate (Cas) and novel SH2-containing protein (NSP) families form one such class of signaling nodes, and correspondingly harbor multiple protein-protein interaction domains and motifs that mediate association with an abundance of cell signaling factors. This allows them to function as mediators that integrate signals emanating from cell adhesion and environmental stimuli to promote cell migration, adhesion and invasion. As such, disregulation of signaling through Cas and NSP proteins is relevant to a spectrum of disease processes, particularly tumor progression and cancer metastasis. The complexity of NSP-Cas functions is best exemplified by two prominent family members p130Cas and the NSP protein BCAR3, which are also known for their ability to confer antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer. Firmly embedded in the Src-Crk signaling axis, p130Cas interacts with more than a dozen signaling factors besides Src family kinases and Crk, including FAK, PYK2, FRNK, RapGEF1, Aurora kinase A, PI3K, NMP4, NCK1 and SHIP2 (reviewed in ref ). BCAR3 is associated with enhanced PI3K activity downstream of growth factor receptors and subsequent activation of Rac, Cdc42, AKT and PAK1. Besides this spectrum of signaling partners, p130Cas and BCAR3 also bind directly to each other, thereby linking their respective signaling networks to form a platform that mediates migratory signaling. In addition to BCAR3, p130Cas is also capable of interacting with NSP family members NSP3 and NSP1. On the other hand, BCAR3 has been shown to interact with HEF1 (Cas-L) in addition to p130Cas. Further combinations are created by association of the NSP family members NSP3 and NSP1 with the Cas proteins Cas-L and Efs, adding to the diversity of NSP–Cas signaling networks. NSP and Cas family proteins are therefore capable of propagating class-specific but promiscuous combinatorial networks, which are each essential to allow their diverse functions in specialized cellular processes. As such the effect of aberrant NSP–Cas signaling is manifested in a range of disease processes. p130Cas and BCAR3 have long been known to exert a concerted effect in cancer, while the NSP3 (SHEP1)–Cas-L signaling node has recently been found to be crucial for B-cell migration and maturation. Additionally the NSP3–p130Cas module is reported to be essential in neuronal cells in for proper olfactory development, and when absent causes a phenotype reminiscent of the human developmental disorder Kallmann syndrome. These examples underline the central importance of distinct NSP–Cas modules in cellular processes that require integration of adhesion and chemotactic stimuli. While it is known that the respective C-terminal domains of Cas and NSP proteins are fundamental to their interaction (Supplementary Fig. 1a), it has remained unclear at the molecular level how different family members can interact in this class-specific yet promiscuous manner. Moreover the predicted nature of the C-terminal Cas and NSP domains suggest an unprecedented interaction mechanism. The NSP-binding portion of Cas proteins has been proposed to assume a focal-adhesion targeting (FAT) domain-like fold, while the C-terminal domain of NSP proteins shares weak homology with Cdc25-homology domains (Cdc25-hd) found in GTPase exchange factors. However, the molecular mechanism of a direct Cdc25-hd:FAT interaction is currently without precedent, and the question of how this influences the putative activities of each domain while mechanically linking NSP and Cas signaling remains outstanding. To shed light on the molecular features enabling the formation of Cas–NSP signaling modules, we have solved the crystal structures of the C-terminal region of unbound human BCAR3 and of the complex between human NSP3 and p130Cas. These structures in combination with our biochemical and biological analyses show that the Cdc25-homology domain present in NSP proteins has evolved as an adaptor domain based on an enzymatic fold used in RasGEFs. This unique NSP structure is specifically tailored to tightly bind the FAT domain of Cas proteins using a distinctive extended interface. Furthermore, the sophisticated and class-specific interaction patterns observed in the NSP3 and p130Cas interfaces are conserved among the members of both families. As a result, NSP and Cas proteins can promiscuously interact with each other to form various combinations of signaling modules that finely regulate cellular processes. RESULTS. BCAR3 HAS AN UNCONVENTIONAL CDC25-HOMOLOGY DOMAIN. To elucidate the enigmatic nature of NSP protein signaling, we sought to obtain structural and mechanistic insight into the C-terminal domain of the best characterized family member, BCAR3. Thorough in vitro investigation of this domain, or any other NSP C-terminal domain, had previously been prevented by the poor protein chemical properties of this region. After testing various constructs, we succeeded in generating a soluble BCAR3 C-terminal domain (spanning residues 502–825) with properties suitable for biochemical and structural investigation. Extensive screening of crystallization conditions resulted in well-diffracting BCAR3 crystals, which allowed us to solve the structure of BCAR3 at a resolution of 2.4 Å (Fig. 1a). The crystal structure contains four molecules of BCAR3 in the asymmetric unit, which overlay with excellent fidelity (RMSD range 0.24–0.45 Å). The BCAR3 structure reveals an unexpected Ras-type GDP exchange factor architecture that sheds light on the contradictory nature of NSP proteins reported in the literature. BCAR3 adopts the overall fold of the Cdc25-homology domain structures solved to date with RMSD values between the BCAR3 core and SOS, EPAC2 or RasGRF1 of 2.18 Å, 2.35 Å and 2.19 Å respectivel",PMC,pos,1,pos,2821,pos_PMC,0.9971384,1

Activated transcription of the bacteriophage T4 late genes, which is coupled to concurrent DNA replication, is accomplished by an initiation complex containing the host RNA polymerase associated with two phage-encoded proteins, gp55 (the basal promoter specificity factor) and gp33 (the coactivator), as well as the DNA-mounted sliding-clamp processivity factor of the phage T4 replisome (gp45, the activator). We have determined the 3.0 Å-resolution X-ray crystal structure of gp33 complexed with its RNA polymerase binding determinant, the β-flap domain. Like domain 4 of the promoter specificity σ factor (σ(4)), gp33 interacts with RNA polymerase primarily by clamping onto the helix at the tip of the β-flap domain. Nevertheless, gp33 and σ(4) are not structurally related. The gp33/β-flap structure, combined with biochemical, biophysical, and structural information, allows us to generate a structural model of the T4 late promoter initiation complex. The model predicts protein/protein interactions within the complex that explain the presence of conserved patches of surface-exposed residues on gp33, and provides a structural framework for interpreting and designing future experiments to functionally characterize the complex.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2836,pos_MEDLINE,0.99779594,1
22158899,"Crystal structure of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation 1 (MALT1) paracaspase region. The mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation 1 (MALT1) paracaspase, a key component of the Carma1/Bcl10/MALT1 signalosome, is critical for NF-κB signaling in multiple contexts. MALT1 is thought to function as a scaffold and protease to promote signaling; however, the biochemical and structural basis of paracaspase action remains largely unknown. Here we report the 1.75-Å resolution crystal structure of the MALT1 paracaspase region, which contains the paracaspase domain and an ensuing Ig-like domain. The paracaspase and the Ig domains appear as a single folding unit and interact with each other through extensive van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds. The paracaspase domain adopts a fold that is nearly identical to that of classic caspases and homodimerizes similarly to form an active protease. Unlike caspases, the active and mature form of the paracaspase domain remains a single uncleaved polypeptide and specifically recognizes the bound peptide inhibitor Val-Arg-Pro-Arg. In particular, the carboxyl-terminal amino acid Arg of the inhibitor is coordinated by three highly conserved acidic residues.

22193718,"How a single residue in individual β-thymosin/WH2 domains controls their functions in actin assembly. β-Thymosin (βT) and WH2 domains are widespread, intrinsically disordered actin-binding peptides that display significant sequence variability and different regulations of actin self-assembly in motile and morphogenetic processes. Here, we reveal the structural mechanisms by which, in their 1:1 stoichiometric complexes with actin, they either inhibit assembly by sequestering actin monomers like Thymosin-β4, or enhance motility by directing polarized filament assembly like Ciboulot βT. We combined mutational, functional or structural analysis by X-ray crystallography, SAXS (small angle X-ray scattering) and NMR on Thymosin-β4, Ciboulot, TetraThymosinβ and the long WH2 domain of WASP-interacting protein. The latter sequesters G-actin with the same molecular mechanisms as Thymosin-β4. Functionally different βT/WH2 domains differ by distinct dynamics of their C-terminal half interactions with G-actin pointed face. These C-terminal interaction dynamics are controlled by the strength of electrostatic interactions with G-actin. At physiological ionic strength, a single salt bridge with actin located next to their central LKKT/V motif induces G-actin sequestration in both isolated long βT and WH2 domains.

22221265,"Solution structure of CCL21 and identification of a putative CCR7 binding site. Chemokines are a group of approximately 50 small, secreted proteins that function as chemoattractants, directing leukocyte trafficking in normal immune function and a variety of disease states(1). They target a family of approximately 20 seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that enable cells to migrate in response to a chemokine concentration gradient(1). CCL21 was cloned in the late nineties(2) and CCR7 was identified as the receptor for this chemokine(2, 3). CCL19 is a related chemokine that can also activate CCR7(4). Expression of CCL21 is localized to lymphoid organs, including lymph nodes, spleen and appendix(2). CCL21 and CCL19 normally function to recruit CCR7 expressing antigen presenting cells, like dendritic cells, and naïve T-cells to the lymph nodes(5, 6). Hence, CCL21 and CCL19 bring these cell types in close proximity allowing for T-cell antigen-specific activation(5, 6). This may explain reports suggesting that CCL21 and CCL19 are anti-tumorigenic, because introduction of CCL21 and/or CCL19 into a primary tumor could activate the immune system generating a response against the tumor cells(5). Most primary tumor environments lack expression of CCL21(5). However, when cancer tumors do express CCL21, as Shields et al. report for melanoma, CCL21 expression favors tumor progression by creating a tolerogenic microenvironment through the recruitment of cells that form a lymphoid-like environment(7). Lymph nodes produce CCL21 and CCL19 and are a common location for cancer metastases to form. Sentinel lymph nodes are tested to determine if cancers of various types have metastasized. Numerous cancer types including breast, colon, cervical, and skin cancers, have increased expression of CCR7 and migrate to the lymph nodes specifically in response to CCL21 during metastasis as originally shown by Muller and colleagues(8). Expression of CCR7 in some cancers is correlated with a poor prognosis and, although CCL21 and CCL19 are both ligands for CCR7, CCL21 appears to be the primary ligand involved in metastasis of solid tumors to the lymph nodes(5, 8–12) whereas CCL19 recruits T-ALL cells to the central nervous system(13). To enable the future development of CCL21-directed cancer therapies, we solved the solution structure of CCL21, determined its oligomeric state and identified CCL21 residues putatively involved in binding to the N-terminus of CCR7. CCL21 is unusual in that it contains six cysteines versus the typical four found in almost all other chemokines, including CCL19(14). Additionally, while CCL19 is 77 residues in length, typical of most chemokines, CCL21 is 111 residues long due to the presence of an extended C-terminal domain(14). CCL21 was expressed as a Hexa-His tagged SMT3-CCL21 fusion, cleaved from the SMT3 fusion protein using ubiquitin like protease-1 and purified to > 98% homogeneity via reverse phase HPLC. Detailed methods for expression, purification, and structure determination are found in the supplemental materials. As shown in Supplemental Figure 1, equivalent activation of CCR7 in a calcium flux assay was observed for equal concentrations of recombinant CCL21 and commercial CCL21 indicating the formation of proper disulfide bonds. NMR samples for CCL21 structure determination contained 500 µM U-15N,13C-CCL21 in 20 mM MES at pH 5.9 with 10% D2O and 0.02% NaN3. Standard NMR techniques were used for chemical shift assignments and structure determination(15). Like all chemokines, CCL21 binds to a G-protein coupled receptor and to glycosaminoglycans. Normally the conserved chemokine domain accomplishes both of these functions. However, some have suggested the extended C-terminal region of CCL21 is responsible for binding glycosaminoglycans(16), while the chemokine domain functions as the CCR7 agonist. Based on structural homology and previous functional studies, we expected CCL21 to consist of an N-terminal chemokine domain and a C-terminal extension. Figure 1 A and B shows the solution structure of residues 8–70 of CCL21 (PDB ID 2l4n and BMRB ID 17245) and structure statistics are presented in Supplemental Table 1. As expected, residues 1–70 of CCL21 comprise the canonical chemokine fold. Despite the β-carbon chemical shifts indicating presence of a disulfide bond between Cys 80 and Cys 99, the C-terminal extension of CCL21 is unstructured as indicated by the low heteronuclear 15N-1H NOE values (Figure 1C) and the lack of long-range NOEs. Additionally, Talos+(17) identified no regions of β-sheet or α-helix in the C-terminus. Supplemental Figure 2 shows an ensemble of 20 full-length CCL21 structures. The unstructured, extended C-terminus of CCL21 complicated attempts to define CCL21’s oligmeric state via comparing intrinsic fluorescence polarization values from tryptophan 59 of CCL21 and translational self-diffusion coefficient measurements to globular protein standards. It was difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the oligomeric state of CCL21 other than over the concentrations examined, 10 µM to 500 µM, the oligomeric state did not change. Thus sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed which is a thermodynamically rigorous method not dependent on the use of standards. Detailed methods are found in the supplemental material. Three CCL21 samples of differing concentrations (19.6, 29.3 and 68.8 µM in phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4 were allowed to attain equilibrium at several speeds at 20°C. The complete data set showed no indication of multiple species and thus was globally fit to a single species model. The ratio of the fitted weight average molecular weight to the sequence weight was 1.05 indicating CCL21 is a monomer.

22244766,"Structural basis for recognition of H3T3ph and Smac/DIABLO N-terminal peptides by human Survivin. SUMMARY. Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family protein implicated in apoptosis and mitosis. In apoptosis, it has been shown to recognize the Smac/DIABLO protein. It is also a component of the chromosomal passenger complex, a key player during mitosis. Recently, Survivin was identified in vitro and in vivo as the direct binding partner for phosphorylated Thr3 on histone 3 (H3T3ph). We have undertaken structural and binding studies to investigate the molecular basis underlying recognition of H3T3ph and Smac/DIABLO N-terminal peptides by Survivin. Our crystallographic studies establish recognition of N-terminal Ala in both complexes, and identify intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions in the Survivin phosphate-binding pocket that contribute to H3T3ph mark recognition. In addition, our calorimetric data establish that Survivin binds tighter to the H3T3ph-containing peptide relative to the N-terminal Smac/DIABLO peptide, and that this preference can be reversed through structure-guided mutations that increase the hydrophobicity of the phosphate-binding pocket. INTRODUCTION. Human Survivin was originally identified as an anti-apoptotic protein, which is overexpressed in most human tumors and fetal tissue, but not in terminal differentiated cells (Ambrosini et al., 1997; Reed, 2001; Sah et al., 2006). It is a small protein (142 residues) belonging to the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein family (Salvesen and Duckett, 2002). The IAP protein family shares a common baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain, which is usually located at the N-terminus of the protein (Srinivasula and Ashwell, 2008). The BIR domain functions as a mediator for protein-protein interactions, through utilization of a deep surface peptide-binding groove to recognize the N-terminal conserved Ala-containing IAP-binding motif (IBM) of the target protein, A well-studied published example involves the recognition of N-terminus Smac/DIABLO (SmacN) IBM by the BIR3 domain of XIAP, in which the N-terminal Ala of Smac inserts into a deep surface pocket of BIR3, with complex formation mediated by extensive intermolecular interactions (Liu et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2000). Although Survivin contains the BIR domain, the role of Survivin in the apoptotic pathway remains to be elucidated (Lens et al., 2006; Yue et al., 2008). One suggested mechanism has proposed that Survivin can bind to Smac, thereby neutralizing the inhibition of XIAP by Smac (Song et al., 2003). Binding of Survivin to Smac has been monitored by NMR with the mapped binding surface overlapping with a region corresponding to the Smac binding site on BIR3 of XIAP (Sun et al., 2005). It has been established that Survivin plays multiple essential roles during mitosis and meiosis as a subunit of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which is enriched on the centromere in early M phase but is relocated to the spindle midzone in anaphase (Ruchaud et al., 2007). The CPC contains two distinct modules, a kinase subcomplex domain composed of the Aurora B kinase and the C-terminal fragment of the inner centromere protein (INCENP), and a chromosomal localization subcomplex composed of the N-terminal fragment of INCENP, Survivin and Borealin (Kelly et al., 2007). Further studies have established that Survivin was the CPC component responsible for direct binding of histone H3 phosphorylated at Thr3 (H3T3ph), thereby recruiting CPC to mitotic chromatin during mitosis (Kelly et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Yamagishi et al., 2010). Such recruitment results in the activation of the Aurora B kinase, which can promote spindle assembly and inhibit nuclear reformation (Kelly et al., 2010), and contributes to regulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and kinetochore-microtubule attachment (Wang et al., 2010; Yamagishi et al., 2010). Survivin has been shown to be overexpressed in most cancer cells but not normal terminal differentiated tissues (Ambrosini et al., 1997; Reed, 2001; Sah et al., 2006), and downregulation of Survivin expression and/or its functions can sensitize tumor cells to therapeutics (Kanwar et al., 2010a). Thus, Survivin is a promising drug target against cancer, as well as a biomarker for angiogenesis and cancer diagnosis (Kanwar et al., 2010a; Kanwar et al., 2010b; Pennati et al., 2008; Ryan et al., 2009). Crystal structures are available for both human and mouse Survivin in the free state (Chantalat et al., 2000; Muchmore et al., 2000; Verdecia et al., 2000). Structurally, human Survivin is composed of an N-terminal BIR domain and a C-terminal long α-helix, with the latter shown structurally to form an intermolecular three-helix bundle with the N-terminal fragment of INCENP and Borealin (Jeyaprakash et al., 2007). NMR chemical shift mapping studies have shown that the N-terminal BIR domain of Survivin forms a complex with the N-terminal domain of Smac/Diablo (Sun et al., 2005) and with the N-terminal H3T3ph (Kelly et al., 2010) peptides. Nevertheless, these studies have not identified the detailed intermolecular contacts associated with molecular recognition on complex formation. We report below on crystal structures of human Survivin in complex with unmodified H3, H3T3ph-containing and SmacN peptides, as well as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based studies on the wild-type complex and those containing modified peptides and mutant Survivin. These studies have defined the importance of peptide N-terminal Ala1 recognition in both complexes, and identified details of the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions in the Survivin binding pocket that contribute to H3T3ph mark recognition.

We have constructed real-time pharmacy surveillance scenarios using information technology (IT) to monitor acyclovir prescription. METHODS We collected the number of acyclovir prescriptions from 5138 pharmacies using the Application Server Provider System (ASP) to estimate the number of cases. We then compared the number of those given acyclovir under 15 years old from pharmacy surveillance and sentinel surveillance for chickenpox under the Infection Disease Control Law. RESULTS The estimated number of under 15 years old prescribed acyclovir in pharmacy surveillance resembled sentinel surveillance results and showed a similar seasonal chickenpox pattern. The correlation coefficient was 0.8575. The estimated numbers of adults, older than 15 but under 65 years old, and elderly, older than 65, prescribed acyclovir showed no clear seasonal pattern.

22275375,"Structural basis for Ca2+-induced activation and dimerization of estrogen receptor α by calmodulin. The estrogen receptor α (ER-α) regulates expression of target genes implicated in development, metabolism, and breast cancer. Calcium-dependent regulation of ER-α is critical for activating gene expression and is controlled by calmodulin (CaM). Here, we present the NMR structures for the two lobes of CaM each bound to a localized region of ER-α (residues 287-305). A model of the complete CaM·ER-α complex was constructed by combining these two structures with additional data. The two lobes of CaM both compete for binding at the same site on ER-α (residues 292, 296, 299, 302, and 303), which explains why full-length CaM binds two molecules of ER-α in a 1:2 complex and stabilizes ER-α dimerization. Exposed glutamate residues in CaM (Glu(11), Glu(14), Glu(84), and Glu(87)) form salt bridges with key lysine residues in ER-α (Lys(299), Lys(302), and Lys(303)), which are likely to prevent ubiquitination at these sites and inhibit degradation of ER-α. Mutants of ER-α at the CaM-binding site (W292A and K299A) weaken binding to CaM, and I298E/K299D disrupts estrogen-induced transcription. CaM facilitates dimerization of ER-α in the absence of estrogen, and stimulation of ER-α by either Ca(2+) and/or estrogen may serve to regulate transcription in a combinatorial fashion.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2865,pos_MEDLINE,0.9979007,1
22286291,"Leadership matters: local health department clinician leaders and their relationship to decreasing health disparities. OBJECTIVE The activities that local health departments (LHDs) conduct and their workforce characteristics change over time. We know little, however, about how changes among the services LHDs conduct are associated with the nature of LHD leadership and how these factors impact health. This study investigated changes in LHD services and leadership and how these changes are associated with mortality disparities. DESIGN We conducted regression analyses of secondary data using an exploratory panel time series design. MEASURES We used secondary data to investigate changes in LHD services and leadership and how these changes were associated with each other and with 1993 to 2005 changes in black-white mortality disparities. Local health department services were examined relative to change in breadth of services within each of 10 program domains between 1993 and 2005. LHD leadership was examined for discipline of the lead executive in 1993 and 2005. STUDY POPULATION Our sample included 558 county or multicounty ""common local areas,"" representing county-level data for LHDs and their jurisdictions. RESULTS Significant beneficial relationships exist between having a clinician as lead executive in an LHD and reductions in black-white mortality disparities. Local health departments with a clinician (usually a nurse or physician) as their lead executive in 1993 and/or 2005 experienced a significant decrease in black-white mortality disparities for young adults (age 15-44 years) in their jurisdictions from 1993 to 2005 when compared with LHDs with nonclinician leaders. CONCLUSIONS The discipline of an LHD's lead executive as a clinician appears to have a significant relationship with the impact of LHD practice on reducing black-white mortality disparities. This study suggests that the discipline of an LHD's leadership may be an important factor to consider in relation to local public health capacity to impact health disparities. Further research related to the mechanisms at play in these relationships is warranted.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,2868,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.00206277,0
22307274,"Structural basis for recognition of H3K56-acetylated histone H3-H4 by the chaperone Rtt106. To understand the mode of action of Rtt106, we characterized its three-dimensional (3D) structure and probed its association with histones. Rtt106 is modular (Supplementary Fig. 1), consisting of a homodimeric N-terminal domain (Rtt106DD; residues 1–42) and a double PH domain (Rtt106PH; residues 68–301) linked via a disordered region (residues 43–67) (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Figs 2 and 3). The 3D structure of Rtt106DD, determined using NMR spectroscopy, shows a previously undiscovered fold with each protomer adopting a V-shaped conformation consisting of two α-helices separated by a trans-proline residue (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1). The first and second α-helices of each protomer interact with the second and first α-helices of the other protomer, respectively, through extensive hydrophobic contacts (Fig. 1a). The 3D structure of Rtt106PH, determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.4Å (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2), reveals similarity to the structure of Pob3, a protein thought to have a role in histone deposition (Supplementary Fig. 4). We performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements to probe the interaction of Rtt106DD–Rtt106PH (residues 1–301) with the histone H3–H4 complex reconstituted using non-acetylated H3 and H3 with an acetyl-lysine analogue chemically installed at position 56 (ref. 12). Rtt106 binds both non-acetylated and K56-acetylated H3–H4. However, acetylation results in enhanced affinity (Fig. 1c). In first approximation, the biphasic curve for the interaction of Rtt106 with non-acetylated H3–H4 in Fig. 1c can be interpreted as two concurrent binding isotherms in a two-site binding model with dissociation constants Kd1 = 0.4 ± 0.2 μM and Kd2 = 1.5 ± 0.2 μM. Agreeing well with two binding sites, one from Rtt106DD and the other from Rtt106PH, Rtt106DD (residues 1–42) alone binds H3–H4 in an acetylation-independent manner. ITC data are consistent with a one-site binding model with a Kd of 0.6 ± 0.1 μM (Fig. 1d), close to Kd1 above. The reaction stoichiometry indicates that Rtt106DD, a dimer, binds two H3–H4 molecules, most likely in the form of an (H3–H4)2 tetramer (Fig. 1d). Binding of Rtt106DD with H3–H4 was also demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 5). To interpret the biphasic ITC thermograms for the interaction of Rtt106 with K56-acetylated H3–H4, we considered a two-site binding model with an activation term that accounts for the effect of acetylation. The first dissociation constant Kd1ac = 0.8 ± 0.4 μM is similar to Kd1 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 6). The second dissociation constant, Kd2ac, is 0.08 ± 0.06 μM. In comparison to Kd2, the apparent gain in affinity for Rtt106PH is approximately 15-20-fold. These results indicate that the acetylated region of H3 is recognized by Rtt106PH but not by Rtt106DD. This was verified by monitoring NMR chemical shift perturbations in 1H–15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) correlation spectra of 15N-labelled Rtt106 (residues 1–67) and Rtt106PH upon titration with a non-labelled H3K56ac peptide (residues 51–61) (Fig. 1b). No binding to Rtt106 (residues 1–67) was observed upon addition of up to 15 molar excess of peptide (data not shown). In contrast, the H3K56ac peptide does specifically bind Rtt106PH as demonstrated by marked chemical shift changes (Δδ ≥ 0.2 p.p.m.) for 38 backbone amide signals of Rtt106PH (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 7). The affected residues are mapped to the second PH domain, specifically at the interface of the carboxy-terminal α-helix (α5), two underlying β-sheets and the flexible tether connecting the two PH domains (Fig. 1b). Noticeably, this region differs from the binding sites of previously characterized PH domains (Supplementary Fig. 8). The Kd for the Rtt106PH–H3K56ac peptide interaction is 0.9 ± 0.1 mM (Supplementary Fig. 9). The markedly reduced affinity compared to that obtained for Rtt106DD–Rtt106PH (residues 1–301) and full-length H3–H4 is expected because the complete interaction is combinatorial with Rtt106DD and Rtt106PH both contacting H3–H4. Rtt106PH by itself has limited selectivity towards acetylation with only a twofold decrease in affinity for the non-acetylated H3K56 peptide (Kd = 1.9 ± 0.4 mM). How then does K56 acetylation specifically enhance the affinity of H3–H4 for Rtt106? Recent biophysical studies have highlighted the structural heterogeneity of H3 αN helix in the context of (H3–H4)2, suggesting that the structure and dynamics of αN could be readily altered by post-translational modifications. K56, being the C-terminal residue of αN, contributes favourably to helical stability via charge interaction with the α-helix dipole. Therefore, in neutralizing the charge of K56, acetylation may increase the conformational entropy of αN, favouring interaction with Rtt106. This may be correlated to the observed entropy-driven increase in affinity upon acetylation (Supplementary Fig. 6). In comparison to Rtt106PH (residues 68–301), the crystal structure of the longer Rtt106PHL (residues 68–315), with an α-helical extension from residues 302 to 311 (Supplementary Fig. 4), reveals a change in the conformation of K301 that leads to the identification of a K56/K56ac binding cleft in Rtt106 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). Via an approximately 180° hinged motion, the side chain of K301 changes from being solvent-exposed in the structure of Rtt106PH to being partially buried in a cleft that is part of the H3K56ac peptide-binding region identified using NMR spectroscopy (Figs 1b, e and 2a). Noticeably, the 1H–15N chemical shifts of several Rtt106PHL residues in the vicinity of the K301-occupied cleft match well the end-point chemical shifts of corresponding Rtt106PH residues upon titration with the H3K56ac peptide (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 10).

22334682,"Helical repeat structure of apoptosis inhibitor 5 reveals protein-protein interaction modules. Apoptosis inhibitor 5 (API5) is an anti-apoptotic protein that is up-regulated in various cancer cells. Here, we present the crystal structure of human API5. API5 exhibits an elongated all α-helical structure. The N-terminal half of API5 is similar to the HEAT repeat and the C-terminal half is similar to the ARM (Armadillo-like) repeat. HEAT and ARM repeats have been implicated in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the cellular roles of API5 may be to mediate protein-protein interactions. Various components of multiprotein complexes have been identified as API5-interacting protein partners, suggesting that API5 may act as a scaffold for multiprotein complexes. API5 exists as a monomer, and the functionally important heptad leucine repeat does not exhibit the predicted a dimeric leucine zipper. Additionally, Lys-251, which can be acetylated in cells, plays important roles in the inhibition of apoptosis under serum deprivation conditions.

22364018,"The effect of permeability transition pore opening on reactive oxygen species production in rat brain mitochondria. The influence of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the rat brain mitochondria was studied. It was shown that ROS production is regulated differently by the rate of oxygen consumption and membrane potential, dependent on steady-state or non-equilibrium conditions. Under steady-state conditions, at constant rate of Ca2+-cycling and oxygen consumption, ROS production is potential-dependent and decreases with the inhibition of respiration and mitochondrial depolarization. The constant rate of ROS release is in accord with proportional dependence of the rate of ROS formation on that of oxygen consumption. On the contrary, transition to non-equilibrium state, due to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and progressive respiration inhibition, results in the loss of proportionality in the rate of ROS production on the rate of respiration and an exponential rise of ROS production with time, independent of membrane potential. Independent of steady-state or non-equilibrium conditions, the rate of ROS formation is controlled by the rate of potential-dependent uptake of Ca2+ which is the rate-limiting step in ROS production. It was shown that MPTP opening differently regulates ROS production, dependent on Ca2+ concentration. At low calcium MPTP opening results in the decrease in ROS production because of partial mitochondrial depolarization, in spite of sustained increase in oxygen consumption rate by a cyclosporine A-sensitive component due to simultaneous work of Ca2+-uniporter and MPTP as Ca2+-influx and efflux pathways. The effect of MPTP opening at low Ca2+ concentrations is similar to that of Ca2+-ionophore, A-23187. At high calcium MPTP opening results in the increase of ROS release due to the rapid transition to non-equilibrium state because of cytochrome c loss and progressive gating of electron flow in respiratory chain. Thus, under physiological conditions MPTP opening at low intracellular calcium could attenuate oxidative damage and the impairment of neuronal functions by diminishing ROS formation in mitochondria.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,2897,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.002238721,0
22366302,"Structural determinants of MALT1 protease activity. The formation of the CBM (CARD11-BCL10-MALT1) complex is pivotal for antigen-receptor-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Signaling is dependent on MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1), which not only acts as a scaffolding protein but also possesses proteolytic activity mediated by its caspase-like domain. It remained unclear how the CBM activates MALT1. Here, we provide biochemical and structural evidence that MALT1 activation is dependent on its dimerization and show that mutations at the dimer interface abrogate activity in cells. The unliganded protease presents itself in a dimeric yet inactive state and undergoes substantial conformational changes upon substrate binding. These structural changes also affect the conformation of the C-terminal Ig-like domain, a domain that is required for MALT1 activity. Binding to the active site is coupled to a relative movement of caspase and Ig-like domains. MALT1 binding partners thus may have the potential of tuning MALT1 protease activity without binding directly to the caspase domain.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2899,pos_MEDLINE,0.99783,1
22375184,"A rare case of a signet ring cell carcinoma of the colon mimicking a juvenile polyp. INTRODUCTION. Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRC) in the colon is rare and occurs earlier in life than other types of adenocarcinoma. SRC is usually diagnosed at advanced stages and has a poor prognosis.1,2 The gross morphology of SRC is usually scirrhous or ulcerated.1 We report a case of early stage primary SRC that was initially misdiagnosed as a juvenile polyp and treated with polypectomy followed by surgical resection. CASE REPORT. A 21-year-old male was admitted to our institution for treatment of hematochezia. The patient had no previous medical history. His vital signs were stable and his hemoglobin level was 13.9 mg/dL. Abdominopelvic enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a polyp with active bleeding at the proximal rectum just below the rectosigmoid junction (Fig. 1). Colonoscopy revealed a Yamada type IV colon polyp with a head 0.5 cm in size in the proximal rectum. The head showed erythematous changes and surface erosions, and we therefore assumed that this polyp was the bleeding point. The polyp was initially diagnosed as a juvenile polyp after considering the patient's age, the gross morphology of the polyp and the history of bleeding. After hypertonic saline epinephrine injection, a snare polypectomy was performed and the polyp was completely removed (Fig. 2). The diagnosis was corrected to SRC after biopsy (Fig. 3). The patient's cancer was confined to the muscularis mucosa. Angiolymphatic invasion and tumor budding were not observed in the biopsy specimen. The longitudinal safety margin was 0.9 cm, and the lateral safety margin was 0.4 cm. We observed no dysplasia around the lesion. No additional lesions were found on positron emission tomography CT (PET CT) or esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Surgical resection was performed due to the polyp's poorly differentiated histopathology. There were no residual tumors or lymph node metastasis in the surgical specimen (Fig. 4). DISCUSSION. More than 96% of cases of SRC arise in the stomach, and the rest occur in the colon, rectum, gallbladder, pancreas, urinary bladder, and breast.3 In the present case, the primary lesion was believed to be the rectum because no other organ involvement was detected by esophagogastroduodenoscopy, abdominal CT or PET CT. An additional surgical resection was performed due to a report indicating that lymph node metastasis often occurs in association with very small SRCs.4 The surgical specimen was free of lesions. In a previous study of 26 cases of early stage primary colon SRC2 with a mean age of 57.1 years (range, 6 to 69 years), six cases with mucosal cancer were documented, 16 with flat depressed lesions and 10 with polypoid lesions.2 SRC of the colon (including the advanced form) comprises about only 1% of all cases of colon cancer.2 When compared with other types of adenocarcinoma, patients with SRC in the colon are younger, more likely to experience lymph node metastasis and have a poorer prognosis.5 Colon cancer is rare in children and adolescents, with only 159 cases (ages, 4 to 20 years) reported between January 1974 and December 2005 worldwide. Young colon cancer patients experienced poorer prognoses than adults, and 18% of juvenile colorectal cancer cases were SRC.6 Common endoscopic characteristics of juvenile polyps are erythematous changes and erosion of the head. Bleeding is also quite common in juvenile polyps, making them even more difficult to diagnose. The practice of routine colonoscopy for health screening is increasing in South Korea, but in the absence of pain or bleeding, most physicians do not perform colonoscopies in younger patients, which results in late discovery of SRC, usually in the advanced form. There are two proposed pathways for the origin of SRC: a de novo pathway and origination from adenoma.7,8 In the present case, few elongated glands were found in the head of the polyp, which laid under the signet ring cells. However, it is difficult to determine whether the lesion originated from a juvenile polyp due to the small number of elongated glands observed. We were unable to eliminate the possibility of malignant transformation from a juvenile polyp. We hypothesized that, in our case, SRC originated by the de novo pathway because we observed no dysplasia around the lesion. Due to the scarcity of reports regarding colon SRC, it is difficult to interpret the prognosis or natural history of this lesion. More case reports, accompanied by additional pathological and molecular biological studies, are required in order to establish an effective treatment strategy for primary SRC of the colon.",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,2902,far_neg_PMC,0.0046006194,0
22379314,"Use of 3-d stereolithographic models in oral and maxillofacial surgery. OBJECTIVE To assess the feasibility of the use of 3-dimensional (3-D) stereolithographic (SLA) technology in complex maxillofacial reconstructive surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS 3-D SLA technology was used in the treatment planning of complex maxillofacial procedures performed by the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at Boston University. Specialized 3-D models were ordered and utilized for surgical treatment of a variety of indications including trauma surgery, temporomandibular joint surgery, orthognathic surgery, secondary correction of facial and skull deformities, and extensive jaw pathology. This technology was also used in one patient for jaw reconstruction using novel bone and tissue engineering techniques. RESULTS The use of 3-D models in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery significantly improved predictability of clinical outcomes when compared to similar treatments without its use. Total operating time was reduced which had the benefit of decreasing the duration of general anesthesia and reducing wound exposure time. They allowed for assessment of extensive traumatic and pathologic defects in three-dimensions prior to surgical reconstruction. The models were also useful in the design and fabrication of custom prostheses, sizing of bone grafts and allowed for manufacturing of scaffolds for bone regeneration. CONCLUSIONS 3-D SLA models can be very effectively used in oral and maxillofacial surgery for multiple indications and diverse clinical scenarios.

22392341,"Backbone (1)H, (13)C, and (15)N resonance assignments of guanylyl cyclase activating protein-1, GCAP1. BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT. Guanylyl cyclase activating proteins (GCAPs) belong to the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) branch of the calmodulin superfamily (Ames et al. 1996; Burgoyne 2007) and regulate Ca2+-sensitive activity of retinal guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) in rod and cone cells (Palczewski et al. 1994). Phototransduction in retinal rods and cones is modulated by intracellular Ca2+ sensed by GCAPs (Palczewski et al. 2000) and defects in Ca2+ signaling by GCAPs are widely linked to retinal diseases (Kitiratschky et al. 2009; Payne et al. 1998). The GCAPs (GCAP1 (Palczewski et al. 1994), GCAP2 (Dizhoor et al. 1995), GCAP3 (Imanishi et al. 2002) and GCAP4-8 (Imanishi et al. 2004) are all ∼200-residue proteins containing four EF-hand motifs (Fig. 1) and a covalently attached N-terminal myristoyl group. Mg2+ binds to three EF-hands (EF2, EF3 and EF4) in the light, when cytosolic Ca2+ levels are low, to activate RetGC. Ca2+ also binds functionally to these three EF-hands in the dark, when Ca2+ levels are high, to inhibit RetGC (Lim et al. 2009; Peshenko and Dizhoor 2007). The first EF-hand (EF1) is unable to bind Ca2+ or Mg2+ due to conserved substitutions in the binding loop (Cys29 and Pro30 in GCAP1). The x-ray crystal structure of Ca2+-bound GCAP1 (Stephen et al. 2007) and NMR structure of GCAP2 (Ames et al. 1999) clearly showed that Ca2+ is bound at EF2, EF3 and EF4. In addition, the N-terminal myristoyl group in GCAP1 is buried inside the Ca2+-bound protein flanked by hydrophobic residues at the N- and C-termini (see residues highlighted blue in Fig. 1). The structure of the RetGC-activator form of GCAPs (Mg2+-bound/Ca2+-free state) is currently unknown. Atomic resolution structures of GCAPs in both the Mg2+-bound (activator) and Ca2+-bound (inhibitor) states are needed to elucidate their Ca2+-induced conformational changes that control activation of RetGC during visual recovery. We report here detailed NMR resonance assignments for Ca2+-bound GCAP1 as a first step toward this end. METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS. EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION OF GCAP1. Uniformly 15N- or 15N/13C-labeled unmyristoylated GCAP1 was expressed in E. coli strain, BL21(DE3) transformed with the plasmid encoding GCAP1 by growing it in M9 medium supplemented with 15N-NH4Cl and/or 13C6-glucose, and 100 ug/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to cells and growing for 5 h at 25°C. Typically, a 1-l culture yields about 10 mg of purified protein. Detailed procedures for purifying GCAP1 are described elsewhere (Lim et al. 2009). Triply labeled (perdeuterated) 2H/15N/13C-labeled GCAP1 was expressed in the similar way described above with the exception that 1H2O and 13C6-glucose were substituted with 2H2O and 13C6–2H7-glucose. NMR SPECTROSCOPY. Samples of recombinant Ca2+-bound unmyristoylated GCAP1 (0.7 mM) were prepared in 93%/7% H2O/D2O with 5 mM TRIS (pH 7.4), 5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, and 50 mM octylglucoside. NMR experiments were conducted using Bruker Advance 600 or 800 MHz spectrometers equipped with a triple resonance cryogenic probe. All experiments were performed at 317 K. Backbone chemical shift assignments were obtained using 15N-HSQC, HNCO, HNCA, HNCACB, HNCOCA, HNCOCACB spectra. NMR data were processed using NMRPipe (Delaglio et al. 1995) software package and analyzed using SPARKY. ASSIGNMENTS AND DATA DEPOSITION. Figure 2 presents HSQC spectra of Ca2+-bound GCAP1 at pH 7.4 to illustrate representative backbone resonance assignments. NMR assignments were based on 3D heteronuclear NMR experiments performed on 2H/13C/15N-labeled GCAP1 (residues 2–204). The protein sample in this study consists of 204 native residues with an unmyristoylated N-terminus at Gly 2. Most of the non-proline residues exhibited strong backbone amide resonances with uniform intensities, indicative of a well-defined three-dimensional protein structure. The terminal 18 residues at both the N- and C-terminus are unstructured based on their chemical shift index (Wishart et al. 1992). More than 90% of the backbone resonances (1HN, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13CO) were assigned. The chemical shift assignments (1H, 15N, 13C) of Ca2+-bound GCAP1 have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu) under accession number 18026. The chemical shift index (CSI) of each amino acid residue reveals a protein secondary structure in GCAP1 in solution (Fig. 1)similar to that observed previously in the xray crystal structure (Stephen et al. 2007) and NMR structure of GCAP2 (Ames et al. 1999). GCAP1 contains 10 α-helices and two antiparallel β-sheets (α1: 18–29; β1: 33–35; α2: 36–43; α3: 50–63; β2: 70–72; α4: 73–83; α5: 89–99; β3: 106–108; α6: 109–119; α7: 130–141; β4: 149–151; α8: 152–160; α9: 163–171; α10: 175–183). The NMR assignments reported here for Ca2+-bound GCAP1 are overall quite different from those reported previously for other NCS proteins, recoverin (Ames et al. 1997) and NCS-1 (Lim et al. 2011). The most noteworthy chemical shift differences are observed for non-conserved residues known to interact with the N-terminal myristoyl group (highlighted blue in Fig. 1), consistent with the recent proposal that N-terminal myristoylation creates a unique binding site environment in each highly homologous NCS protein (Lim et al. 2011).",PMC,pos,1,pos,2908,pos_PMC,0.997459,1
22411828,"Structure of the ZU5-ZU5-UPA-DD tandem of ankyrin-B reveals interaction surfaces necessary for ankyrin function. Ankyrin-R/B/G (encoded by ANK1/2/3, respectively) are a family of very large scaffold proteins capable of anchoring numerous receptors and ion channels to specific, spectrin-containing membrane micro-domains. Hereditary mutations of ankyrins are known to be associated with diseases including spherocytosis, cardiac arrhythmia, and bipolar disorder in humans, although the underlying molecular bases are poorly understood. The middle spectrin-binding domain of ankyrins contains highly conserved ZU5-ZU5-UPA-DD domains arranged into the ZZUD tandem. Curiously, most of the disease-causing mutations in the tandem have no apparent impact on the spectrin binding of ankyrins. The high resolution structure of the ankyrin-B ZZUD tandem determined here reveals that the ZU5-ZU5-UPA domains form a tightly packed structural supramodule, whereas DD is freely accessible. Although the formation of the ZZU supramodule does not influence the spectrin binding of ankyrins, mutations altering the interdomain interfaces of ZZU impair the functions of ankyrin-B&G. Our structural analysis further indicates that the ZZU supramodule of ankyrins has two additional surfaces that may bind to targets other than spectrin. Finally, the structure of the ankyrin ZZUD provides mechanistic explanations to many disease-causing mutations identified in ankyrin-B&R.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2913,pos_MEDLINE,0.99804294,1
22446388,"Crystal structure of the human spastin AAA domain. INTRODUCTION. Microtubules, an essential component of the cytoskeleton, can interconvert between periods of growth and periods of depolymerization. This process, termed dynamic instability, depends heavily upon specialized proteins that modulate microtubule dynamics (Mitchison & Kirschner, 1984). A number of diseases are attributed to mutations in proteins that regulate microtubule homeostasis. One such disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), is commonly the result of mutations in the ATPase spastin. Point mutations and exon deletions in spastin account for the majority of cases of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (Depienne et al., 2007). This disease, which primarily affects the lower limbs, is caused by a progressive degeneration of the motor axons of the corticospinal tract. Previous studies have shown that spastin has a microtubule severing activity (Evans, Gomes, Reisenweber, Gundersen, & Lauring, 2005), and that this activity is linked to the manifestation of neurological disorders in Drosophila (Roll-Mecak & Vale, 2005). Because of spastin’s significant role in the development of HSP, there have been an increasing number of studies on this protein and its role in axonal degeneration. Spastin is a member of the AAA+ family of proteins. These proteins have a wide variety of cellular functions (hence the name AAA – ATPases Associated with various cellular Activities) (Vale, 2000). A structural hallmark of AAA+ proteins is that they generally form hexameric rings. It has been shown by sedimentation velocity and gel filtration assays (White, Evans, Lary, Cole, & Lauring, 2007), and more recently, by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) (Roll-Mecak & Vale, 2008) that spastin forms a hexamer in solution. By mutating a glutamic acid residue of the Walker B motif to glutamine (E442Q), spastin can be trapped in the hexameric form, even in the presence of ATP, the binding of which normally causes hexamer disassembly. This mutation has also been used to characterize the binding of the spastin hexamer to the C-terminal tail of tubulin (White et al., 2007). Although it is clear that spastin binds to the C-terminal tail of tubulin, the specific residues required for this activity are still unknown, and existing studies are not in complete agreement (White et al., 2007; Roll-Mecak & Vale, 2008). However, there does appear to be consensus that the binding of the negatively charged tubulin tail takes place within the positively charged, central pore of spastin, and that the pore loops of the AAA domain are involved. Like all other AAA+ proteins, spastin contains an AAA domain. The AAA domain can be divided into a large / nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a smaller four-helix bundle domain (HBD)(White et al., 2007; Roll-Mecak & Vale, 2008). Within the large AAA domain are several motifs that are important for the catalytic ATPase activity, including a Walker A (P-loop) motif and a Walker B (Switch II) motif, which in ATPases are involved in both hydrolysis and in sensing the presence or absence of the nucleotide -phosphate. N-terminal to the AAA domain is the MIT (microtubule interacting and trafficking) domain (Ciccarelli et al., 2003). The crystal structure of this domain has been solved in complex with CHMP1B (Yang et al., 2008), an ESCRT-III protein that targets spastin to the midbody, where it is involved in microtubule organization during cytokinesis (Roll-Mecak & McNally, 2010; Schiel et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2008). The MIT domain is not needed for microtubule severing (White et al., 2007), nor does it bind strongly to microtubules on its own (Roll-Mecak & Vale, 2005). Connecting the MIT domain to the AAA domain is a flexible linker containing a putative microtubule binding domain (MTBD) that binds to tubulin in an ATP-independent manner (White et al., 2007). Although studies have shown that several residues at the C-terminal end of this linker are necessary for microtubule severing (White et al., 2007; Roll-Mecak & Vale, 2008), further studies are needed in order to fully characterize the function of this region. Despite extensive efforts, until recently very little structural information has been available for the spastin protein, and the detailed kinetic studies required to uncover the mechanism of severing are not possible without structural information. The crystal structure of the AAA domain of the Drosophila spastin protein has been determined (Roll-Mecak & Vale, 2008), and its structure closely resembles that of other AAA proteins. We report here the 3.3 Å X-ray crystal structure the AAA domain of human spastin (SPG4) and show that, despite amino acid differences in a number of key residues, the human and Drosophila spastin structures are highly conserved. MATERIALS AND METHOD. EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. The human spastin gene was placed into the pGEX-6P-3 vector to express a glutathione-S-transferase fusion of amino acids 228-616 containing the E442Q mutation, as previously described (Evans et al., 2005). The spastin protein construct was expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL cells, grown in LB with antibiotic selection to an optical density of 1.0, by induction with 0.5 mM IPTG. After overnight growth at 30°C, cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet [Roche]) for sonication.

22447446,"Interactions between DNA, transcriptional regulator Dreb2a and the Med25 mediator subunit from Arabidopsis thaliana involve conformational changes. INTRODUCTION. Eukaryotic cells express a set of general transcription factors (GTFs: TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH) and RNA polymerase II, which are required for transcription of all protein-encoding genes. Together, the GTFs form a so called pre-initiation complex (PIC) that assembles close to the transcription start site. Transcription is regulated at several levels; most importantly by changes in chromatin structure and by transcriptional regulators (activators or repressors) that bind to specific DNA sequences. In the latter process, transcriptional regulators execute their function by affecting different steps in transcription such as formation of the PIC (1,2), promoter escape (3) and elongation (4–6). There are several examples of direct interactions between DNA-bound transcriptional regulators and components of the general transcription machinery, but these interactions are not sufficient to support regulated transcription. Instead, transcriptional regulators operate through interactions with different types of coregulators (coactivators and corepressors), which transmit signals to the general transcription machinery. Coregulators are not believed to interact with DNA, but rather to form bridges between the DNA-bound activators/repressors and the GTFs. The most important coregulator is mediator, a multisubunit protein complex which is required for proper expression of nearly all genes in all eukaryotes (7). Mediator was initially identified in yeast (8,9), but it is now clear that mediator is present in all eukarya and a common terminology for mediator subunits in all species has been proposed (10,11). Even though the subunit composition and the structure of mediator are well described, less is known about how mediator operates to integrate and convey signals from DNA-bound transcriptional regulators. This is in part due to its complexity and size. Direct interactions between transcriptional regulators and different mediator subunits are believed to recruit and stabilize mediator at the promoter, and there are indications that interactions with transcriptional regulators induce conformational changes or structural shifts in mediator (12–14). It is possible that such conformational changes in mediator are propagated to induce further structural shifts in components of the general transcription machinery. These changes, combined with other signal pathways that cause posttranslational modifications of different transcription factors, might therefore determine the level of transcription from each gene. We recently identified mediator in Arabidopsis thaliana and we have also reported that the Med25 subunit in Arabidopsis interacts with three different transcription factors, Dreb2a, Zfhd1 and myb-like which all are involved in different stress response pathways (15,16) In this article, we use a set of biochemical and biophysical methods to study interaction between the Med25 mediator subunit and the transcription factor Dreb2a from A. thaliana. We also investigate how this interaction is affected by the presence of the cognate DNA-binding site for Dreb2a. Our results show that functional interactions between Dreb2a and Med25 induce conformational changes which in turn cause changes in their binding affinity. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PROTEIN PURIFICATION AND EXPRESSION. Purification of Med25551–680 and Dreb2a168–335 was carried out as described previously (16). The GST-tag of Med25551–680 that is removed by cleavage with Prescission Enzyme (GE Healthcare) was collected and stored in −20°C before use as a control for the experiments described in Figure 7. The nucleotide sequence corresponding to amino acids 168–253 (Dreb2a168–253) and 254–335 (Dreb2a254–335) was amplified from cDNA with polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the NcoI/NotI sites of the pETM-6×his vector (kindly provided by Günter Stier, EMBL, Germany). The primers used were: 5′-GCTACCATGGATTGTGAATCTAAACCCTTCT-3′and 5′-GCTTGCGGCCGCTTACAAGTGACTCTGATCCACATG-3′ for Dreb2a168–253 and 5′-GCTACCATGGATTCTTCAGACATGTTTGATG-3′ and 5′-GCTTGCGGCCGCTTAGTTCTCCAGATCCAAGTAACT-3′ for Dreb2a254–335. Dreb2a168–253 and Dreb2a245–335 were cloned into the pETM-6×his vector and produced as described for Dreb2a168–335 (16). Final purification of Dreb2a168–253 and Dreb2a254–335 was made with ion exchange chromatography using a Mono Q 5/50 GL (GE Healthcare). The proteins were applied to the columns in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.2 and sodium acetate buffer pH 5.2, respectively. Both buffers contained 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and a starting concentration of 20 mM NaCl. Adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 18 column volumes to 0.8 M NaCl on an ÄKTAexplorer (GE Healthcare). Full-length Dreb2a, Dreb2af.1., was cloned into a pETM-6×his-GB1 vector at the NcoI/NotI sites and the resulting plasmid was transfected into the Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS strain. The bacteria were grown at 30°C in Terrific Broth supplemented with 100 µg/ml kanamycin and 34 µg/ml chloramphenicol. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to 1 mM at OD600 = 1.5. After 6 h of induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were lysed in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP40 and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The lysates were sonicated on ice with a Branson Sonifier 450 equipped with a microtip (VWR, Sweden). The following settings were applied: duty cycle 50%, output control 3.5, time 8 min. The lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 35 000 g for 1 h using a 45Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter AB, Sweden), and Dreb2af.1. was purified from the supernatant by ammonium sulfate precipitation (20%). Precipitated proteins were dissolved in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol and loaded onto a Mono S 5/50 GL (GE Healthcare). Adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient to 800 mM NaCl. Fractions containing Dreb2af.1. were pooled, and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris",PMC,pos,1,pos,2927,pos_PMC,0.9946464,1
22493266,"The E. coli CsgB nucleator of curli assembles to β-sheet oligomers that alter the CsgA fibrillization mechanism. Curli are extracellular proteinaceous functional amyloid aggregates produced by Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and other enteric bacteria. Curli mediate host cell adhesion and invasion and play a critical role in biofilm formation. Curli filaments consist of CsgA, the major subunit, and CsgB, the minor subunit. In vitro, purified CsgA and CsgB exhibit intrinsically disordered properties, and both are capable of forming amyloid fibers similar in morphology to those formed in vivo. However, in vivo, CsgA alone cannot form curli fibers, and CsgB is required for filament growth. Thus, we studied the aggregation of CsgA and CsgB both alone and together in vitro to investigate the different roles of CsgA and CsgB in curli formation. We found that though CsgA and CsgB individually are able to self-associate to form aggregates/fibrils, they do so using different mechanisms and with different kinetic behavior. CsgB rapidly forms structured oligomers, whereas CsgA aggregation is slower and appears to proceed through large amorphous aggregates before forming filaments. Substoichiometric concentrations of CsgB induce a change in the mechanism of CsgA aggregation from that of forming amorphous aggregates to that of structured intermediates similar to those of CsgB alone. Oligomeric CsgB accelerated the aggregation of CsgA, in contrast to monomeric CsgB, which had no effect. The structured β-strand oligomers formed by CsgB serve as nucleators for CsgA aggregation. These results provide insights into the formation of curli in vivo, especially the nucleator function of CsgB.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2941,pos_MEDLINE,0.99615306,1

Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) is the major component of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex, which is crucial for the transcription and replication of the viral genome. We have determined the crystal structure of influenza B virus NP to a resolution of 3.2 Å. Influenza B NP contains a head, a body domain, and a tail loop. The electropositive groove between the head and body domains of influenza B NP is crucial for RNA binding. This groove also contains an extended flexible charged loop (amino acids [aa] 125 to 149), and two lysine clusters at the first half of this loop were shown to be crucial for binding RNA. Influenza B virus NP forms a crystallographic homotetramer by inserting the tail loop into the body domain of the neighboring NP molecule. A deeply buried salt bridge between R472 and E395 and a hydrophobic cluster at F468 are the major driving forces for the insertion.

22550171,"Structural basis for sigma factor mimicry in the general stress response of Alphaproteobacteria. Reprogramming gene expression is an essential component of adaptation to changing environmental conditions. In bacteria, a widespread mechanism involves alternative sigma factors that redirect transcription toward specific regulons. The activity of sigma factors is often regulated through sequestration by cognate anti-sigma factors; however, for most systems, it is not known how the activity of the anti-sigma factor is controlled to release the sigma factor. Recently, the general stress response sigma factor in Alphaproteobacteria, σ(EcfG), was identified. σ(EcfG) is inactivated by the anti-sigma factor NepR, which is itself regulated by the response regulator PhyR. This key regulator sequesters NepR upon phosphorylation of its PhyR receiver domain via its σ(EcfG) sigma factor-like output domain (PhyR(SL)). To understand the molecular basis of the PhyR-mediated partner-switching mechanism, we solved the structure of the PhyR(SL)-NepR complex using NMR. The complex reveals an unprecedented anti-sigma factor binding mode: upon PhyR(SL) binding, NepR forms two helices that extend over the surface of the PhyR(SL) subdomains. Homology modeling and comparative analysis of NepR, PhyR(SL), and σ(EcfG) mutants indicate that NepR contacts both proteins with the same determinants, showing sigma factor mimicry at the atomic level. A lower density of hydrophobic interactions, together with the absence of specific polar contacts in the σ(EcfG)-NepR complex model, is consistent with the higher affinity of NepR for PhyR compared with σ(EcfG). Finally, by reconstituting the partner switch in vitro, we demonstrate that the difference in affinity of NepR for its partners is sufficient for the switch to occur.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,2955,pos_MEDLINE,0.99744415,1

The hydration of Th(IV) in ThCl(4) and ThBr(4) water solutions at different salt concentrations was studied in order to understand the structure of Th(IV) in liquid water and the effect of Br(-) and Cl(-) anions on its hydration structure. Several theoretical methods were employed: density functional theory and classical molecular dynamics based on both semiempirical polarizable potentials and ab initio derived polarizable potentials. The results of the computations were combined with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experimental data. The results of this study show that in pure water the Th-O distance of 2.45 Å corresponds to a first shell coordination number between 9 and 10. In the salt solutions, while Br(-) does not affect directly the hydration of Th(IV) also at relatively high concentrations, Cl(-), on the other hand, is more structured around Th(IV), in agreement with recent high-energy X-ray scattering experiments. Counterions, even at relatively high concentrations (0.8 m), do not enter in the first solvation shell of Th(IV), but they induce an increase of water molecules in the first and second hydration shells of Th(IV).",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,2960,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.003714474,0

HRAS-like tumor suppressor 3, a representative member of this group, plays a key role in regulating triglyceride accumulation and energy expenditure in adipocytes and therefore constitutes a novel pharmacological target for treatment of metabolic disorders causing obesity. Here, we delineate a catalytic mechanism common to lecithin:retinol acyltransferase-like proteins and provide evidence for their alternative robust lipid-dependent acyltransferase enzymatic activity. We also determined high resolution crystal structures of HRAS-like tumor suppressor 2 and 3 to gain insight into their active site architecture.

Translesion synthesis is a fundamental biological process that enables DNA replication across lesion sites to ensure timely duplication of genetic information at the cost of replication fidelity, and it is implicated in development of cancer drug resistance after chemotherapy. The eukaryotic Y-family polymerase Rev1 is an essential scaffolding protein in translesion synthesis. Its C-terminal domain (CTD), which interacts with translesion polymerase ζ through the Rev7 subunit and with polymerases κ, ι, and η in vertebrates through the Rev1-interacting region (RIR), is absolutely required for function. We report the first solution structures of the mouse Rev1 CTD and its complex with the Pol κ RIR, revealing an atypical four-helix bundle. Using yeast two-hybrid assays, we have identified a Rev7-binding surface centered at the α2-α3 loop and N-terminal half of α3 of the Rev1 CTD. Binding of the mouse Pol κ RIR to the Rev1 CTD induces folding of the disordered RIR peptide into a three-turn α-helix, with the helix stabilized by an N-terminal cap. RIR binding also induces folding of a disordered N-terminal loop of the Rev1 CTD into a β-hairpin that projects over the shallow α1-α2 surface and creates a deep hydrophobic cavity to interact with the essential FF residues juxtaposed on the same side of the RIR helix.

22705208,"Crystal structure of the ternary complex of a NaV C-terminal domain, a fibroblast growth factor homologous factor, and calmodulin. SUMMARY. Voltage-gated Na+ (NaV) channels initiate neuronal action potentials. NaV channels are composed of a transmembrane domain responsible for voltage-dependent Na+ conduction and a cytosolic C-terminal domain (CTD) that regulates channel function through interactions with many auxiliary proteins, including fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) and calmodulin (CaM). Most ion channel structural studies have focused on mechanisms of permeation and voltage-dependent gating but less is known about how intracellular domains modulate channel function. Here we report the crystal structure of the ternary complex of a human NaV CTD, an FHF, and Ca2+-free CaM at 2.2 Å. Combined with functional experiments based on structural insights, we present a platform for understanding the roles of these auxiliary proteins in NaV channel regulation and the molecular basis of mutations that lead to neuronal and cardiac diseases. Furthermore, we identify a critical interaction that contributes to the specificity of individual NaV CTD isoforms for distinctive FHFs. INTRODUCTION. In the axon initial segment of neurons a large and rapid influx of sodium ions (INa) through voltage-gated Na+ (NaV) channels is responsible for the rapid upstroke of the action potential. Dysregulation of NaV channels leads to a variety of neurological disorders. Mutations in SCN1A and SCN2A, which encode NaV1.1 and NaV1.2, respectively, lead to various epilepsy syndromes. Both gain- and loss of-function mutations have been described (Meisler et al., 2010), emphasizing the importance of the precise regulation of channel function. Mutations in the SCN5A-encoded cardiac NaV1.5, with similar biophysical consequences, have been linked to various inherited arrhythmias (Zimmer and Surber, 2008). NaV channels, which are monomers with tetrameric repeats of 6 transmembrane (TM) segments, share a similar architecture with other voltage-gated cation (Ca2+ and K+) channels. In these 6 TM segments, the first 4 TM segments (S1 – S4) comprise the voltage-sensor domain (VSD) and the last 2 TM segments (S5 and S6) make up a central pore when assembled as a tetrameric configuration. The pore mediates selective cation permeation through its selectivity filter, and this conduction can be allowed (open) or obstructed (closed) by a “gate” near the intracellular membrane surface of the pore lined by S6. In voltage-gated cation channels, VSDs control pore gating upon sensing a change in membrane voltage. Four VSDs are located on the periphery of the central pore (Figure S1). While the pore-forming α-subunit is responsible for the fundamental properties of voltage-dependent Na+ conduction, auxiliary proteins regulate channel function. Most voltage-gated ion channel structural studies have focused on the general mechanisms of permeation and voltage-dependent gating by studying prototypical Kv channels, such as an archaeal Kv channel (KvAP), the Shaker-type Kv channel (Kv1.2), and the NaV channel from Arcobacter butzleri (NavAb) (Jiang et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2005; Long et al., 2005; Payandeh et al., 2011). Much less is known about how their intracellular domains, such as the NaV cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (CTD), modulate channel function, however. Most NaV channel auxiliary proteins interact with the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (CTD) of the channel's α-subunit (Figure S1). Among these are the NaV β subunit, through its short cytoplasmic domain (Spampanato et al., 2004); calmodulin (Mori et al., 2003); and members of the fibroblast growth factor homologous factor (FHF) family (Liu et al., 2001). Not only is the NaV CTD important for the regulation of channel activity, but a significant number of disease-causing mutations are localized to NaV CTDs (Lossin, 2009; Ohmori et al., 2006; Spampanato et al., 2004) and their associated proteins (van Swieten et al., 2003). FHFs belong to the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) superfamily (Smallwood et al., 1996), but are functionally different from canonical FGFs (Olsen et al., 2003). The four FHF genes (FGF11-FGF14) encode 10 isoforms generated by alternative splicing of exons that encode an extended N-terminus preceding a core domain that is homologous with FGFs. Unlike FGFs, FHF N-termini lack signal sequences and so are not secreted from cells (Smallwood et al., 1996). Moreover, they cannot activate FGF receptors because of subtle structural differences in their FGF-like core (Olsen et al., 2003). Rather than serving as extracellular growth factors, FHFs remain intracellular, bind to NaV CTDs, and modulate NaV channel function (Liu et al., 2001; Lou et al., 2005). This NaV-modulating role was highlighted by the identification of FGF14 as the locus for spinocerebellar ataxia 27 (van Swieten et al., 2003), and demonstration that the mutant FGF14 reduces NaV channel currents, alters channel gating, and decreases neuronal excitability in a dominant negative manner (Laezza et al., 2007). Although several FHFs are expressed in the brain, they are not functionally redundant. Gene deletion of Fgf14 in mice causes ataxia, dyskinesia, and dystonia (Wang et al., 2002). Knockout of Fgf12 exacerbates all of those phenotypes and exaggerates the effects on neuronal NaV channels (Goldfarb et al., 2007). In addition to regulating Na+ conduction, FHFs also affect NaV channel trafficking to the plasma membrane and targeting to the axon initial segment (Laezza et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011a). The ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM) also binds NaV CTDs, near the putative FHF interaction site. A familial autism-associated mutation localizes to the CaM binding region in NaV1.2 and is postulated to alter regulation of Ca2+-dependent NaV1.2 channel function (Weiss et al., 2003). How CaM controls NaV channel function is not clear, and whether Ca2+ also affects NaV channel function through direct binding to a putative EF hand in the CTD has been controversial (Miloushev et al., 2009; Shah et al., 2006).

INTRODUCTION Various cytokines have been associated to the occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm neonates. AIM To establish an association between cord blood cytokines and BPD, so that they could be used, in clinical practice, as early markers of BPD. MATERIAL AND METHODS Preterms less than 30 weeks gestational age, were analysed by ELISA microassay for venous cord blood IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and IL-10, and compared between the BPD and non-BPD groups. RESULTS One hundred and fifty neonates completed the study; 31 (21%) small for gestational age (SGA); 16 were deceased before 28 days of life; 36 developed mild BPD and 20 developed moderate/severe BPD. Elevated cord blood IL-8 was associated with death or moderate/severe BPD. SGA patients with moderate/severe BPD presented higher cord blood values of IL-8, lower IL-6 and IL-10 when compared with SGA without moderate/severe BPD; and higher IL-8 levels when compared with patients without moderate/severe BPD.

22715410,"Nuclear import and export signals of human cohesins SA1/STAG1 and SA2/STAG2 expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. INTRODUCTION. Division of the eukatryotic cell requires exact distribution of a proper number of chromosomes into both daughter cells during mitosis. This involves, among others, tight coupling of sister chromatids until the early or mid-phase of mitosis and then their concerted separation at the onset of anaphase. One of the principal mechanisms responsible for the association of chromatids prior to their segregation is sister chromatid cohesion that relies on a complex of proteins highly conserved from yeasts to mammals, called cohesin. This complex consists of four core subunits: the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins SMC1 (Smc1 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and SMC3 (Smc3), the kleisin SCC1/RAD21 (Scc1/Rad21/Mcd1), and the least studied HEAT-repeat domain subunit called Irr1/Scc3 in yeast and SA/STAG or stromalins in humans. The basic function of the SA proteins has been elucidated owing to findings on the role of their yeast orthologue Irr1p [1]. Human cells contain two mitotic equivalents of Irr1, SA1 and SA2 (also called STAG1 and STAG2), which are present in two distinct 14S cohesin complexes [2]–[4]. Initially it was shown that these two complexes differ by their SA constituent, SA1 or SA2, and it was assumed that only one type of SA is present in a given cell [2], [5], [6]. However, subsequent data obtained by Canudas and Smith [7] indicated that both SA1 and SA2 were in fact present in one cell and were specifically required for the cohesion of chromosome arms and telomeres, and centromeres, respectively. Recent stoichiometry data indicate that in HeLa cells the ratio of complexes containing SA1 and SA2 is in the range between 1∶12 and 1∶15 [8]. Several topological models of sister chromatid cohesion have been proposed (for review: [9]). The most popular one-ring model assumes that the complex surrounds the replicated sister chromatids, with SMC1 and SMC3 creating a V-shaped heterodimer bridged by SCC1 [10]; [11]. Another model posits that the complex consists of two cohesin rings, each encircling a single chromatid, that are paired through an interaction of the C-terminal domain of SCC1 with SA [6]. In mammalian cells most cohesin complexes are associated with chromatin. However, a large fraction of cohesin on chromosome arms dissociates already during prophase, while the cohesin at the centromeres remains bound until the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Gerlich et al. [12] identified three sub-populations of cohesin complexes whose SA proteins differed in their dynamic equilibrium rate between chromatin-bound and soluble state. Also in yeast the core cohesin subunits are dynamic. They are able to bind to and dissociate from chromatin and, potentially, to dissociate/associate from the whole cohesin complex in vivo. These events take place on a time scale less than a cell cycle, but without the loss of chromosome cohesion [13]. Metazoan cells undergo open mitosis with the microtubule-organizing centers, centrosomes, located outside the nucleus. At the onset of mitosis (prometaphase), the nuclear envelope breaks down and nuclear pore complexes disassemble. This enables microtubules of the spindle to interact with centrosomes [14], [15]. Also at this stage of mitosis a large fraction of cohesin dissociates from chromosome arms. In addition to its originally identified function in ensuring cohesion of chromatids, the SA2 protein takes part in regulating transcription, where it can function as a co-activator [16] as well as element of the insulator complex [17]. The molecular mechanisms enabling such diverse activities and the functional distinction between SA1 and SA2 are poorly understood. We undertook to address these questions by using a simplified model of the yeast cell for initial experiments. Budding yeast, as many other single-cell Eukaryota, undergo closed mitosis throughout which their nuclear envelope remains intact [18]. Although closed mitosis is different from the open one in a number of features, the fundamental mechanisms of chromosome segregation are preserved, and the continuous presence of the nuclear envelope facilitates studies of a crucial aspect of the process, namely nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of proteins. We took advantage of this aspect of yeast mitosis and also of the fact that it expresses only a single SA orthologue to study functional differences between the human SA paralogues. SA1 and SA2 were expressed individually in S. cerevisiae and their subcellular localization was investigated. Since our in silico analysis indicated that several nuclear localization signals (NLS) are present in SA1 and SA2, we investigated their functionality. Unexpectedly, also putative nuclear export signals (NES) were detected, suggesting the possibility that the SA proteins could shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We showed that the SA2 protein, but not SA1, can indeed be exported from the nucleus using a Crm1-dependent route. Experiments in HeLa cells were performed to validate the yeast data. They confirmed the functionality of the NLS signal identified in SA1, but the import and putative export of SA2 turned out to be more complex than in yeast. Since the Crm1-dependent export pathway is conserved in humans we propose that nuclear export can also be used to regulate the activity of SA2 protein in human cells. This is the first report of the possibility of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of a member of the cohesin complex. RESULTS. EXPRESSION OF HUMAN SA1 AND SA2 PROTEINS IN YEAST. Four variants of nucleotide sequences encoding human SA1 and five variants of SA2 are registered in UniProt and/or deposited in other databases.

OBJECTIVES To assess the associations between oral disease and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in a nationally representative sample of 12- and 15-year-old Thai populations. METHODS The study was part of Thailand National Oral Health Survey. Data on oral diseases using WHO criteria and OHRQoL using the Child-Oral Impacts on Daily Performances (Child-OIDP) for 12-year-olds and Oral Impacts on Daily Performances (OIDP) indexes for 15-year-olds were collected from 1063 12-year-olds and 811 15-year-olds. The associations of oral diseases and OHRQoL and perceived dental need were investigated using logistic regression models. RESULTS Of 81.7% of 12-year-olds and 83.2% of 15-year-olds had impacts on OHRQoL. For both age groups, gingivitis was the most common oral disease (79.3% in 12-year-olds, 81.5% in 15-year-olds). Oral impacts were significantly associated with high levels of untreated decay. Perceived dental needs were significantly associated with untreated decay and extensive gingivitis for both age groups, and with calculus for 12-year-olds. Having decayed teeth was statistically associated with impacts on relaxing, emotion and study for both age groups. Gingivitis and calculus were significantly associated with impacts on smiling, study and social contact in 12-year-olds, and with impacts on smiling in 15-year-olds. CONCLUSIONS Gingivitis was the most common oral disease whereas dental caries affected children's quality of life most. Dental caries impacted on various daily life performances while gingivitis and calculus related to psychosocial aspects in 12-year-olds.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3002,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.001976184,0
22760507,"Direct and quantitative analysis of underivatized acylcarnitines in serum and whole blood using paper spray mass spectrometry. INTRODUCTION. Newborn screening for inborn metabolic errors is a well-established public health program. State-based newborn screening programs started 50 years ago in the USA, and more than 150 million infants have been screened [1, 2]. The screening tests and follow-up treatments allow early diagnosis and proper medical management to prevent significant and irreversible damage, such as mental retardation [3]. It has been suggested that mandatory screening be implemented using a panel of core biomarkers for 29 genetic conditions, including nine organic acidurias, six amino acidurias, five disorders of fat oxidation, three hemoglobin-opathies, and six others [4]. Fatty acid oxidation (FAO) disorders are one of the most common inherited metabolic disorders, and they are associated with the complex pathways of fatty acid transport and mitochondrial oxidation. The rate for combined incidence of these disorders is 1:9,300 among live births [5]. Early diagnosis of these conditions is critical because life-threatening symptoms could occur without warning during the newborn period and through adulthood. Once diagnosed, low-fat and high-carbohydrate dietary management and long-term monitoring of serum glucose can help patients live a normal life [6]. Acylcarnitines are a group of esters derived from reaction of carnitine with fatty acids, and their most important function is to transport fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for fatty acid β-oxidation. Increases in certain acylcarnitines in blood of infants are indicators of deficiencies in fatty acid oxidation enzymes [7], and they have been used as informative biomarkers to diagnose specific fatty acid oxidation disorders in patients. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was first used to identify acylcarnitines [8]; since then mass spectrometry has played an important role in the analysis of acylcarnitines, and it is rapidly becoming the primary analytical technology in clinical screening. At the early stage of the development, fast atom bombardment and liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry were utilized as the main ionization methods for polar analytes with high molecular weight [9–11]. The purified samples needed for these experiments were embedded in a non-volatile liquid matrix and ionized under vacuum, representing an inconvenience in sample preparation regimen. These methods were replaced by electrospray ionization (ESI) [12] which serves as a natural interface between MS and liquid chromatography [13]. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and isotopic dilution allow quantitative analysis of metabolites to be achieved using ESI with less sophisticated separation methods [14–16]. Currently, flow injection ESI–MS/MS is the main technique for acylcarnitine analysis, due to low sample consumption with automated, rapid analyses and the high degree of chemical specificity achieved [17–19]. Although ESI–MS/MS analysis of acylcarnitines is claimed to take 2–3 min per sample, this does not take into account the much longer time for sample preparation [17]. For newborn screening, sample preparation includes punching out dried blood disks followed by analyte extraction and derivatization processes that are relatively labor intensive and time consuming. The recent development of ambient ionization techniques[20] has provided an alternative way to rapidly and efficiently ionize complex samples from a wide variety of surfaces with minimal sample preparation [21, 22]. Desorption electrospray ionization [23], direct analysis in real time [24], and many other methods [25–27] have been successfully applied to analyze pharmaceutical compounds in complex biological samples [28–32]. A new technique, paper spray ionization (PS) [33] has been demonstrated to be highly effective for the rapid, direct, and quantitative analysis of complex biological samples such as urine [34], dried blood spots (DBS) [35, 36], and tissue samples [37]. For therapeutic drug monitoring, a chemically diverse set of 15 drugs in blood was investigated, and the analytes were found to be detectable at 1 ng/mL using PS–MS [35, 38]. High precision in quantitative analysis has been achieved with isotopically labeled internal standards added directly to the samples or preprinted onto the paper spray substrate [36]. Cellulose-based paper has been used as the standard medium for DBS in newborn screening, and a major initiative is taking place to use DBS on paper for sample collection and storage for other clinical analyses [39]. The development of direct analysis using paper spray could pave the way for fast and quantitative analysis in clinical laboratories as well as at the point-of-care with highly simplified procedures. While acylcarnitines exist in many different biological fluids, plasma or serum has been the preferred sample matrix for acylcarnitine profiling in the diagnosis of fatty acid oxidation disorders [14]. Other samples, such as bile specimens and amniotic fluid, have been used in acylcarnitine analysis for postmortem diagnosis and prenatal diagnosis, respectively [40, 41]. Analysis of acylcarnitines in samples such as urine, bile, and other biological fluids is generally not comprehensively informative, and therefore, screening of these fluids is less frequently performed except for the diagnosis of some organic acidemias in certain situations [42]. Currently, DBS on paper have become the standard method of sample storage for neonatal screening of inborn errors of metabolism [17, 18]. Analysis using dried blood spots requires small sample amounts (~10–20 μL), so less invasive sampling techniques such as a finger or heel prick can be utilized, which is particularly advantageous for pediatric studies. Easier transport and long-term storage at ambient temperatures are additional advantages. Therefore, we have investigated the application of paper spray mass spectrometry for the rapid, direct, and quantitative analysis of underivatized acylcarnitines in dried serum",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,3003,far_neg_PMC,0.0032350558,0
22789755,"Structural and biochemical studies of a plant formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase reveal why eukaryotic Fpg glycosylases do not excise 8-oxoguanine. 1. INTRODUCTION. Oxidatively induced DNA damage is the unavoidable consequence of the effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on cellular DNA. ROS are common damaging agents predominantly generated by endogenous factors like respiration or photosynthesis. Unrepaired oxidatively induced DNA lesions can lead to severe consequences including apoptosis, mutations, and cancer. Hence, to maintain genomic stability, cells have developed mechanisms to detect and repair DNA damage. The base excision repair (BER) system, a highly conserved repair pathway, is responsible for the repair of the vast majority of oxidative lesions in living organisms across phyla [1–6]. Identification and removal of such lesions are catalyzed by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases that are grouped into two families, based on structural motifs: the “Helix-hairpin-Helix” (HhH) family, named after the HhH structural motif involved in DNA binding, and the Fpg/Nei family, named after the prototypical bacterial members formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg) and endonuclease eight (Nei)[2, 7–10]. Although the DNA glycosylases that specialize in the repair of oxidatively induced lesions fall into two distinct structural families, they all employ a common mechanism involving the extrusion of the target base into the active site pocket. Among the wide variety of oxidative DNA modifications, one of the most common is the oxidation product of guanine, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), which, if unrepaired, can lead to GC→TA transversion mutations [11]. In archaea, fungi and animals, the 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (Ogg) is responsible for the excision of 8-oxoG and belongs to the “HhH” family, whereas in bacteria, 8-oxoG is predominantly removed by Fpg. Remarkably, plants have an Ogg as well as variants of Fpg resulting from alternative splicing. Although the conservation of both Ogg and Fpg appears to be redundant, the characterization of Fpg1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AthFpg1) clearly shows that 8-oxoG is a poor substrate for the plant Fpg; however, it efficiently processes 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyA), 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyG) and the further oxidation products of 8-oxoG, guanidinohydantoin (Gh) and spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp1 and Sp2) [12, 13]. Like other glycosylases recognizing oxidatively induced DNA lesions, AthFpg1 is bifunctional and therefore catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic bond between the damaged base and the deoxyribose (glycosylase activity) before cleaving the DNA backbone (lyase activity). Here we report the crystal structures of a functional C-terminal deletion form of AthFpg1 (AthFpgΔ88) unliganded and in complex with duplex DNA containing a non-hydrolyzable analog of an abasic site, tetrahydrofuran (THF). The structure of AthFpgΔ88 is similar to that of other members of the Fpg/Nei family and, as expected from the absence of zinc-binding cysteine residues, it harbors a zincless finger as observed in human NEIL1 and Mimivirus Nei1 (MvNei1) [14, 15]. However, the most striking difference between AthFpg and the bacterial Fpg proteins is the absence of the αF-β9/10 loop, previously shown to be required for 8-oxoG recognition [16]. We further show here that the αF-β9/10 loop is not only essential for removing 8-oxoG but it is specific for this lesion. 2. MATERIAL AND METHODS. 2.1. PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. Two C-terminal deletion constructs of AthFpg1 were designed based on a prediction of disordered regions (PONDR®, [17]) and an alignment of Fpg/Nei sequences. First, a deletion of 109 C-terminal residues was generated by PCR amplification using primers 5’-GGAATTCCATATGCCGGAGCTTCCAGAG-3’ and 5’-GCTTGTCGACGCATTTCCCATAAAGTTTCTGCAGTTCTGG-3’ and AthFpg1 in a pET28b vector, kindly provided by Dr. Terrence Murphy (University of California, Davis) and subsequently cloned into NdeI-SalI sites of the pET22b expression vector (Novagen). A hexa-histidine tag was added to the C-terminus of the gene by mutating the TGA stop codon into a TGC, coding for a cysteine, resulting in the insertion of a sequence of ten residues, CVDKLAAALE, between the coding sequence and the hexa-His tag. A second truncated protein, lacking the 88 C-terminal residues, was engineered after PCR amplification of the corresponding coding region of the AthFpg1 gene using primers 5’-GGAATTCCATATGCCGGAGCTTCCAGAG-3’ and 5’-CCGCTCGAGATCGTCTTCTTTGGGTTTCAC-3’. The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes and cloned into the NdeI-XhoI sites of the pET22b expression vector, adding a hexa-histidine tag at the C-terminus of the gene. The recombinant AthFpgΔ109 and AthFpgΔ88 were expressed as described previously [12]. Briefly, the proteins were expressed in Rosetta (DE3) pLysS Escherichia coli cells (Novagen), induced with 1 mM IPTG and grown overnight at 16ºC. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM βME, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 mM benzamidine and sonicated. Cleared cell lysate was loaded on a HiTrap chelating HP column (GE healthcare) charged with nickel sulfate and the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole (10–500 mM in 20 column volumes). The pooled fractions of protein were dialyzed in 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM βME and loaded on a HiTrap SP FF column (GE healthcare). A linear NaCl gradient (150 mM-1 M in 20 CV) was used for elution and the protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed in a crystallization buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT). The selenomethionyl variant of AthFpgΔ109 was prepared by inhibiting methionine biosynthesis [18] and purified as described above, except for the final storage buffer, which was 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mM DTT.

22813953,"Distinct neural correlates underlying pretense and false belief reasoning: evidence from ERPs. Two important milestones characterize the development of a theory of mind (ToM): The emergence of pretend play (PT) in which infants as young as 18 months separate the real world from fictional or imagined worlds. And the explicit understanding of false beliefs (FB) which develops around the age of about 4 years and demands a differentiation between mental states and reality. Although there is an outstanding debate about whether or not PT play involves metarepresentation understanding, to date, the neural correlates of FB and PT reasoning have not been investigated within one paradigm. The present study investigated PT and FB in comparison to reality understanding (RE) in an ERP paradigm presenting cartoon stories to 24 healthy adults. Results revealed a sequence of ERP components that distinguished between the conditions. PT compared to FB and RE was associated with a higher P2-amplitude at parieto-occipital sites and a late slow wave divergence (270-600 ms) at left frontal and left posterior positions. These components may indicate the processing of incongruity between the protagonist's knowledge and behavior and the identifying of the intentional character of the pretended action. In accordance with previous ERP studies on FB reasoning, we found late anterior activation (600-900 ms) for FB reasoning, probably indicating the decoupling mechanism involved in metarepresentation. These temporal and topographic differences indicate distinct underlying neural substrates for FB and PT processing, and do not support metarepresentational interpretations of PT.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3016,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0037000459,0
22817985,"Tertiary structure-function analysis reveals the pathogenic signaling potentiation mechanism of Helicobacter pylori oncogenic effector CagA. The Helicobacter pylori type IV secretion effector CagA is a major bacterial virulence determinant and critical for gastric carcinogenesis. Upon delivery into gastric epithelial cells, CagA localizes to the inner face of the plasma membrane, where it acts as a pathogenic scaffold/hub that promiscuously recruits host proteins to potentiate oncogenic signaling. We find that CagA comprises a structured N-terminal region and an intrinsically disordered C-terminal region that directs versatile protein interactions. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the N-terminal CagA fragment (residues 1-876) revealed that the region has a structure comprised of three discrete domains. Domain I constitutes a mobile CagA N terminus, while Domain II tethers CagA to the plasma membrane by interacting with membrane phosphatidylserine. Domain III interacts intramolecularly with the intrinsically disordered C-terminal region, and this interaction potentiates the pathogenic scaffold/hub function of CagA.

22855260,"Interaction between isolated transcriptional activation domains of Sp1 revealed by heteronuclear magnetic resonance. The promoter-specific transcription factor Sp1 is expressed ubiquitously, and plays a primary role in the regulation of the expression of many genes. Domains A and B located in the N-terminal half of the protein are characterized by glutamine-rich (Q-rich) sequences. These Q-rich domains have been shown to be involved in the interaction between Sp1 and different classes of nuclear proteins, such as TATA-binding protein associated factors. Furthermore, the self-association of Sp1 via Q-rich domains is also important for the regulation of transcriptional activity. It has been considered that an Sp1 molecule bound to a ""distal"" GC-box synergistically interacts with another Sp1 molecule at a ""proximal"" binding site. Although the formation of multimers via Q-rich domains seems functionally important for Sp1, little is known about the structural and physicochemical nature of the interaction between Q-rich domains. We analyzed the structural details of isolated glutamine-rich B (QB) domains of Sp1 by circular dichroism (CD), analytical ultracentrifugation, and heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). We found the isolated QB domains to be disordered under all conditions examined. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis of NMR spectra clearly indicated interaction between the domains. In particular, the C-terminal half was responsible for the self-association. Furthermore, analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated weak but significant interaction between isolated QB domains. The self-association between QB domains would be responsible, at least in part, for the formation of multimers by full-length Sp1 molecules that has been proposed to occur during transcriptional activation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3034,pos_MEDLINE,0.9978173,1
22876187,"Structural bases of coronavirus attachment to host aminopeptidase N and its inhibition by neutralizing antibodies. INTRODUCTION. The Coronaviridae is a large family of enveloped, plus-RNA viruses. They are involved in respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neuronal infectious diseases in animals and humans that lead to important economic losses [1], [2], as well as to high mortality rates in severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) infections [3]. The CoVs are a numerous group of Coronaviridae. They have been clustered in the Coronavirinae subfamily, which includes three approved genera, Alpha-, Beta- and Gammacoronavirus, as well as a tentative new genus, the Deltacoronavirus [4]. Representative CoV species in each genus are Alphacoronavirus 1 (comprising transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV) and related canine and feline CoVs), Human coronavirus (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, genus Alphacoronavirus), Murine coronavirus (including mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), genus Betacoronavirus, cluster A), Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-related CoV, genus Betacoronavirus, cluster B), Avian coronavirus (including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), genus Gammacoronavirus), and Bulbul-CoV (tentative genus Deltacoronavirus) [4]. CoV particles display characteristic large surface projections or peplomers (17–20 nm) comprised of homotrimers of the spike glycoprotein (S), a type I membrane protein [1], [5]. The peplomers have a globular portion connected by a protein stalk to the transmembrane domain [6]. The globular region is formed by the N-terminal S1 region, whereas the stalk corresponds to the membrane-proximal S2 region, which mediates virus fusion to host cells and adopts a helical structure characteristic of class I virus fusion proteins [7]. Determinants of CoV tropism locate at the S1 region [1], [8], which mediates attachment of CoV particles to cell surface molecules, initiating virus entry into cells and infection. There is considerable variability in receptor usage among the CoVs. Most Alphacoronavirus such as TGEV and HCoV-229E use APN [9], [10], whereas the related HCoV-NL63 uses a distinct cell entry receptor, the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [11]; SARS-CoV also recognizes the ACE2 receptor [12]. SARS and NL63 CoV bind to common regions of the ACE2 protein, although the structures of their receptor-binding domains (RBDs) are quite distinct [11], [13]. MHV uses the cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1a [14]; a recent crystal structure showed that the MHV RBD adopts a galectin-like fold [8]. The use of alternative receptors that confer extended tropism has been described for SARS-CoV, MHV and TGEV [1], [8]. The mammalian APNs (CD13) are type II cell surface metalloproteases whose large glycosylated ectodomain has a zinc metal ion at the active site [15]. APN is linked to many cell functions, leading it to be termed the “moonlighting enzyme” [15]. Animal models confirmed a role for this cell surface enzyme in angiogenesis [16]. Peptides and inhibitors that target APN showed a link between this protein and tumor growth and invasion [17], [18]. APN is a target for cancer chemotherapies; drugs that bind this protein have been developed to treat tumors, some of which are in clinical trials [19]. As mentioned above, APN is also a major CoV cell entry receptor [1], [9], [10]. CoV recognition of APN is species-specific, and specificity is associated with N-linked glycosylations in the APN protein [20]. Cell tropism and immune neutralization have been extensively studied in some porcine Alphacoronavirus, such as the enteropathogenic TGEV and porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV), a non-enteropathogenic virus derived from TGEV [21]. Both viruses use porcine APN (pAPN) for cell entry. The APN-binding domain in TGEV, PRCV and other Alphacoronavirus locates at the C-terminal portion of the S1 region [8], [22], [23], which bears epitopes recognized by CoV-neutralizing antibodies [22], [23], [24], [25]. Most TGEV-neutralizing antibodies cluster at antigenic site A [25], [26], comprised within the RBD at the S1 region (Figure 1A) [22]; the other antigenic sites defined in the TGEV S1 region (B through D) are outside the RBD (Figure 1A) [21]. To date, there is no structural information available on antibody neutralization and APN recognition by Alphacoronavirus. We determined crystal structures of the PRCV RBD in complex with the pAPN ectodomain, and the TGEV RBD in complex with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1AF10 [25]. The RBD adopts a β-barrel fold, with a distinct protruding tip engaged in pAPN recognition. The structures show how these porcine Alphacoronavirus recognize its cell entry pAPN receptor and how immune neutralization of these CoVs is achieved by antibody targeting of receptor-binding residues in the S protein. The mechanisms used by TGEV to escape immune neutralization and the evolution of receptor recognition in the CoV family are discussed. RESULTS. APN-BINDING DOMAIN AND EPITOPES FOR NEUTRALIZING MABS OVERLAP IN TGEV AND PRCV S PROTEINS. APN receptor recognition and envelope S antigenicity are well documented in TGEV and related PRCV. The pAPN-binding domain was mapped within residues 506 to 655 of the mature TGEV S polypeptide [22], whereas TGEV mAb-resistant (mar) mutants defined four antigenic sites (C, B, D and A) [24], [26] (Figure 1A). Antigenic sites C and B are not present in the PRCV S protein. Antigenic site A determinants are located within the pAPN-binding domain at the C-terminal moiety of the TGEV and PRCV S1 regions (Figure 1A) [21], [22]. We recently reported the modular dissection of the N-terminal S1 region of TGEV and PRCV, and the preparation of soluble S1 length variants with single antigenic sites [27]. We produced a recombinant short S protein fragment termed SA, which comprises only residues 481 to 650 of the TGEV S protein that binds cell surface pAPN (Figure 1B) and displays conformational epitopes for the three antigenic A subsites (Aa, Ab, and Ac) (Figure 1C).

Solution- and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are highly complementary techniques for studying supra-molecular structure. Here they are employed for investigating the molecular chaperone αB-crystallin, a polydisperse ensemble of between 10 and 40 identical subunits with an average molecular mass of approximately 600 kDa. An IxI motif in the C-terminal region of each of the subunits is thought to play a critical role in regulating the size distribution of oligomers and in controlling the kinetics of subunit exchange between them. Previously published solid-state NMR and X-ray results are consistent with a bound IxI conformation, while solution NMR studies provide strong support for a highly dynamic state. Here we demonstrate through FROSTY (freezing rotational diffusion of protein solutions at low temperature and high viscosity) MAS (magic angle spinning) NMR that both populations are present at low temperatures (<0 °C), while at higher temperatures only the mobile state is observed. Solution NMR relaxation dispersion experiments performed under physiologically relevant conditions establish that the motif interchanges between flexible (highly populated) and bound (sparsely populated) states.

The longstanding structure-function paradigm, which states that a protein only serves a biological function in a structured state, had to be substantially revised with the description of intrinsic disorder in proteins. Intrinsically disordered regions that undergo a stimulus-dependent disorder-to-order transition are common to a large number of signaling proteins. However, little is known about the functionality of intrinsically disordered regions in plant proteins. Here we investigated intrinsic disorder in a plant-specific remorin protein that has been described as a signaling component in plant-microbe interactions. Using bioinformatic, biochemical, and biophysical approaches, we characterized the highly abundant remorin AtREM1.3, showing that its N-terminal region is intrinsically disordered. Although only the AtREM1.3 C-terminal domain is essential for stable homo-oligomerization, the N-terminal region facilitates this interaction. Furthermore, we confirmed the stable interaction between AtREM1.3 and four isoforms of the importin α protein family in a yeast two-hybrid system and by an in planta bimolecular fluorescent complementation assay. Phosphorylation of Ser-66 in the intrinsically disordered N-terminal region decreases the interaction strength with the importin α proteins. Hence, the N-terminal region may constitute a regulatory domain, stabilizing these interactions.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3089,pos_MEDLINE,0.997917,1

Many RNA-binding proteins contain multiple single-strand nucleic acid-binding domains and assemble into large multiprotein messenger ribonucleic acid protein (mRNP) complexes. The mechanisms underlying the self-assembly of these complexes are largely unknown. In eukaryotes, the association of the translation factors polyadenylate-binding protein-1 (PABP) and eIF4G is essential for high-level expression of polyadenylated mRNAs. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ternary complex poly(A)(11)·PABP(1-190)·eIF4G(178-203) at 2.0 Å resolution. Our NMR and crystallographic data show that eIF4G interacts with the RRM2 domain of PABP. Analysis of the interaction by small-angle X-ray scattering, isothermal titration calorimetry, and electromobility shift assays reveals that this interaction is allosterically regulated by poly(A) binding to PABP. Furthermore, we have confirmed the importance of poly(A) for the endogenous PABP and eIF4G interaction in immunoprecipitation experiments using HeLa cell extracts.

23066867,"Origin of the conformational heterogeneity of cardiolipin-bound cytochrome C. INTRODUCTION. Interactions of proteins with lipid surfaces are essential in biology and have numerous applications in bio- and nanotechnology. Protein conformational changes, unfolding, and aggregation are common in these phenomena. Mechanistic details of such transformations, however, remain poorly understood. Among biological systems, cytochrome c (cyt c) interactions with cardiolipin (CL)-containing membranes have received considerable attention. The binding activates a peroxidase function in cyt c, a critical event in early stages of apoptosis, by promoting the protein unfolding. Importantly, the peroxidase activity targets CL itself. Peroxidation of CL decreases the strength of cyt c-CL interactions, facilitating the protein detachment from the mitochondrial membrane during apoptosis. Despite many attempts, a consistent structural description of the CL-bound cyt c ensemble has been lacking. The protein conformational heterogeneity complicates the analysis of the species with conventional ensemble-averaged probes. Recent measurements of time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) in dye-labeled cyt c revealed distinct populations of surface-bound polypeptide structures, some that are extended and others that are more compact. The protein peroxidase activity paralleled the population of the extended conformers, suggesting a functional link to partitioning between the two types of species. However, the reasons for the coexistence of two types of CL-bound species are not clear nor is it known if they undergo conformational exchange. Herein we have used a combination of TR-FRET, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and bio-layer interferometry (BLI) to develop a systematic understanding of the partitioning between compact and extended cyt c conformers and provide information on the dynamics of the bound species. This study has identified factors that influence the types of observed protein species and their interactions with the membrane surface, and offers insights for modulating protein conformational distributions and activity. The findings closely relate to cyt c folding dynamics and suggest a general strategy for extending the time window in monitoring the kinetics of folding. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PREPARATION OF PROTEIN DERIVATIVES. Horse heart cyt c mutants Glu92Cys and Glu104Cys were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to published procedures. Protein labeling with the thiol-reactive reagent bimane iodoacetamide (Invitrogen), 1,5-IAEDANS (Invitrogen), and EZ-Link Maleimide-PEG11-Biotin (Thermo Scientific) and purification of dye-labeled products was done as described. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry confirmed the labeling. Wild-type cyt c isolated from equine heart was purchased from Sigma, reoxidized with an excess of K3[Fe(CN)6], and purified with a fast protein liquid chromatography system (FPLC, GE Healthcare). Heme-free cyt c (apocyt c) was prepared with the silver sulfate method, details of which are described in the Supporting Information. Preparation of Zn-substituted cyt c (Zncyt c) and bimane-labeled Zncyt c (ZnBim) is described in the Supporting Information. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 410 nm for heme-containing cyt c (ε = 106,100 M−1 cm−1), 280 nm for apocyt c (ε = 10,900 M−1 cm−1), and 423 nm for Zn-substituted cyt c (ε = 243,000 M−1 cm−1). STABILITY MEASUREMENTS. The unfolding curves of Bim92 cyt c in GuHCl were obtained from absorption, CD, and fluorescence measurements (Bim) as previously described. GuHCl concentrations were checked for accuracy with refractive index measurements. SPECTROSCOPIC MEASUREMENTS. Absorption spectra were measured on an Agilent 8453 diodearray spectrophotometer. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter. The scatter of liposome-containing solutions was removed by subtracting a blank spectrum. Vesicle sizes were determined at room temperature by dynamic light scattering measurement with DynaPro NanoStar™ (Wyatt Technology Europe GmbH). Fluorescence lifetimes were measured by time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) at 10,000 counts using a NanoLED-375L diode laser (λex = 375 nm, <70 ps pulsewidth) as the excitation source and a fast TBX-04 detector. Measurement was done under magic angle conditions. Bim and Dns emission was observed at 480 and 500 nm, respectively. Data Analysis of TR-FRET was done in MATLAB (MathWorks) as previously described. The fluorescence decay rate constant of the unquenched Bim group (k0) is 10.8×107s−1 and was determined with the Bim-Cys model compound. The Förster critical distance, R0, was calculated to be 35 Å for the Bim92 cyt c under both native and denatured conditions, according to the method described in the Supporting Information. The value is assumed to be unchanged upon interactions with liposomes, which was validated with heme absorption measurements. Moment Analysis. The moments (Mn), variance (V), and standard deviations (S) of the P(r) distributions were calculated according to Eqs. 1 and 2:. FLUORESCENCE CORRELATION SPECTROSCOPY (FCS). FCS measurements were performed on a Nikon Ti Eclipse inverted confocal microscope equipped with a Nikon 60× oil-immersion objective (Plan APO). The microscope was upgraded with compact fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and FCS upgrade kit (PicoQuant, Berlin-Adlershof, Germany). Typically 50 μL of the sample (10–50 nM Bim-labeled protein) was placed on top of a glass cover slip (Corning) and excited with a 405 nm pulsed laser diode (LDH-D-C 405, PicoQuant) controlled by a PDL-800D driver (PicoQuant). The excitation power was approximately 1 mW. The fluorescence emission was passed through a bandpass filter (FF01-482/35, Semrock, Rochester, NY) and focused on a pinhole of 37.9 μm.

23085293,"Unique roles of glucagon and glucagon-like peptides: Parallels in understanding the functions of adipokinetic hormones in stress responses in insects. Glucagon is conventionally regarded as a hormone, counter regulatory in function to insulin and plays a critical anti-hypoglycemic role by maintaining glucose homeostasis in both animals and humans. Glucagon performs this function by increasing hepatic glucose output to the blood by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in response to starvation. Additionally it plays a homeostatic role by decreasing glycogenesis and glycolysis in tandem to try and maintain optimal glucose levels. To perform this action, it also increases energy expenditure which is contrary to what one would expect and has actions which are unique and not entirely in agreement with its role in protection from hypoglycemia. Interestingly, glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1 and GLP-2) from the major fragment of proglucagon (in non-mammalian vertebrates, as well as in mammals) may also modulate response to stress in addition to their other physiological actions. These unique modes of action occur in response to psychological, metabolic and other stress situations and mirror the role of adipokinetic hormones (AKHs) in insects which perform a similar function. The findings on the anti-stress roles of glucagon and glucagon-like peptides in mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates may throw light on the multiple stress responsive mechanisms which operate in a concerted manner under regulation by AKH in insects thus functioning as a stress responsive hormone while also maintaining organismal homeostasis.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3106,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0018969199,0
23086146,"Structure of the chemokine receptor CXCR1 in phospholipid bilayers. To examine the structure and function of CXCR1 in its natural environment, we reconstituted the full-length, active receptor in phospholipid bilayers (proteoliposomes). The NMR method we developed, rotationally aligned (RA) solid-state NMR, is specifically tailored for the unique properties of membrane proteins in liquid crystalline phospholipid bilayers. It combines features of magic angle spinning (MAS) and oriented sample (OS) solid-state NMR to resolve and assign resonances associated with each amino acid residue, measure site-specific orientation restraints relative to the bilayer, and calculate the three-dimensional structure of the protein and its integral membrane orientation. It differs from previously used OS methods because it relies on the inherent rotational diffusion of membrane proteins in phospholipid bilayers to provide orientation-dependent motional averaging of dipolar coupling (DC) powder patterns relative to the bilayer normal rather than the orientation-dependent frequencies of single-line resonances observed in OS NMR of stationary, uniaxially aligned samples. Furthermore, the method takes advantage of recent bioinformatics developments that facilitate molecular fragment replacement approaches to structure determination, including membrane proteins. CXCR1 was uniformly 13C/15N labeled by expression in Escherichia coli, then purified, refolded in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) proteoliposomes, and placed as a concentrated suspension in a MAS rotor. Refolded CXCR1 binds IL-8 with high affinity (dissociation constant, Kd ~ 1–5 nM) and couples to its G-protein, Gi/o (half maximum effective concentration, EC50 ~ 1 nM), indicating that the NMR sample conditions are compatible with physiological activity (Supplementary Fig. 1). As expected, the two-dimensional 13C/13C correlation spectrum of this 350-residue protein is quite crowded (Supplementary Fig. 2). However, expansion of the 13CA resonance region has sufficient resolution to contribute to the assignment process (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Spectra, obtained from a uniformly 13C labeled sample with a shorter mixing time and from a sample labeled using 2-13C-glycerol, have fewer signals and improved resolution. Regardless, the vast majority of data used to resolve, assign and measure isotropic chemical shift frequencies from N, CA, CO, and CB sites were obtained from 13C-detected three-dimensional, triple-resonance experiments (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Figs. 3-4; Supplementary Table 2). Overall, 97% of the backbone resonances for residues 20 to 325 were assigned. The missing resonances are from seven Pro (P22, P93, P170, P180, P185, P214, P257) and one Arg (R285). None of the 15N and 13C signals from the mobile N-and C-termini (residues 1-19 and 326-350) could be detected in the spectra, consistent with our observation of these signals in solid-state NMR experiments designed to detect only signals from mobile sites (Supplementary Fig. 6), as well as our previous analysis of local and global motions of CXCR1. Three-dimensional 13C-detected separated local field (SLF) experiments were used to measure the 1H-15N DC and 1H-13CA DC frequencies that provide orientation restraints for structure determination (Fig. 1c, 1d; Supplementary Fig. 5). The protein backbone structure was calculated by a molecular fragment replacement approach. An initial structural model was generated from a set of molecular fragments generated with CS-Rosetta from the experimental chemical shifts, the amino acid sequence of CXCR1, and the helical framework of the prototypical class A GPCR bovine rhodopsin. This initial model was first refined with the experimental restraints using the all atom and the implicit membrane potentials of Rosetta. Finally, the resulting structural model was refined by restrained simulated annealing using Xplor-NIH. The three-dimensional structure of CXCR1 (Fig. 1e) has the consensus fold of a GPCR, with seven transmembrane helices (TM1-TM7) connected by three extracellular loops (ECL1-ECL3) and three intracellular loops (ICL1-ICL3). The average backbone pairwise RMSD is 1.7 Å (Supplementary Table 1) and the experimentally measured 1H-15N DC and 1H-13CA DC values correlate remarkably well with those calculated from the refined protein structure (Fig. 1g; Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, the correlations improve dramatically following refinement of the initial structural model with the experimental data, demonstrating that the NMR structure of CXCR1 is determined by the experimentally measured backbone orientation restraints and dihedral angles. We anticipate that both structural accuracy and precision will improve with inclusion of side chain restraints and, where feasible, distance restraints. DCs contain information about molecular orientation as well as dynamics, and scaling of their values by local internal motions would compromise their analysis in terms of pure orientation restraints. For CXCR1, analysis of the DC data yielded similar values of the magnitude and symmetry of the molecular order tensor for residues in the helices and loops, indicating that these regions of the protein experience a similar degree of order in the lipid bilayer. This is supported by the excellent fit of the DC correlation plots obtained with a single value of the order tensor (Fig. 1g; Supplementary Fig. 7b) and by the observation that >20% of the 1H-15N DC signals from residues distributed throughout the protein sequence, including in loop sites, fall within 10% of the maximum value (21 kHz) expected for a static crystalline sample (Fig. 1d). Following the structure determination of rhodopsin from three- and two-dimensional crystals, the structures of several class A ligand-activated GPCRs have recently been determined by X-ray crystallography. CXCR1 is now the first GPCR with its structure determined in liquid crystalline phospholipid bilayers, and the first ligand-activated GPCR with its structure determined without",PMC,pos,1,pos,3107,pos_PMC,0.9969663,1
23106217,"α(V)β(3) integrin crystal structures and their functional implications. INTRODUCTION. Integrins have noncovalently associated α and β subunits, each with an ectodomain (~ 1,000 residues in α and ~ 700 in β), a single transmembrane domain, and a typically short cytoplasmic domain. Integrin ectodomains have four domains in α and eight in β, of which one in each associate tightly to form a ligand-binding head (Fig. 1). The remaining domains connect the heads through upper legs, knees, and lower legs, to the plasma membrane. In the bent conformation, the knees are bent, and the headpiece (head and upper legs) folds over the lower legs, to form a 2,000 Å2 interface (Fig. 1A). In two extended conformations, the legs are extended at the knees, and the headpiece may either be closed, as in the bent conformation, or open (Fig. 1B and C). Headpiece opening involves a large conformational change at the hybrid domain interface where the βI domain is inserted, i.e. attached at both its N- and C-termini. Headpiece opening is conveyed by α-helix connecting rod-like movements across the βI domain to its interface with the α-subunit where the ligand is bound, and increases affinity for ligand many orders of magnitude (Fig. 1C). Most integrins interact with the actin cytoskeleton, and transmit signals in both directions across the membrane to regulate binding to extracellular ligands, and traction through the cytoskeleton for cell migration and signaling (1). The key question in the integrin field is how signals are transmitted from integrin cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains to the ligand-binding site in the ectodomain to regulate affinity for ligand. We and others have presented extensive evidence for two key types of conformational changes: 1) integrin extension to give the extended-closed state (Fig. 1B) and 2) integrin headpiece opening to give the extended-open state (Fig. 1C) (1). The extended-closed conformation has low affinity for ligand, and only the extended-open conformation has high affinity (2-9). Thus integrin activation by inside-out signals increases the proportion of integrins with the extended-open conformation. These conclusions are supported by a large number of electron microscopy (EM), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and crystallographic studies as well as affinity measurements on cell surfaces. The studies include work on diverse integrins including αVβ3, αIIbβ3, α5β1, αVβ6, αLβ2, and αXβ2 (1). To communicate allostery over unusually large distances through the flexible lower leg of the β-subunit in the extended conformation, it has been emphasized that large separations between the integrin transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains would be required, and evidence for such separation has been obtained by transmembrane domain cross-linking and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments (10-12). On the other hand, another model proposes that integrin activation requires neither extension nor headpiece opening (13, 14). The body of evidence supporting this alternative model is smaller, and is based on studies of integrin αVβ3 (13, 14). Crucial in the latest support for this hypothesis was a crystal structure of integrin αVβ3 (14). Excellent density was reported for the ectodomain, as well as the first three residues of both the αV and β3 TM residues. It was unexpected that the αV and β3 TM residues were far from one another in the crystal structure (25 Å), because structures for the closely related αIIb and β3 TM domains show the same residues in close contact (15-17). Nonetheless, a model was made by bending the ectodomain-TM linkers in both αV and β3 to bring the TM domains close, and it was suggested that some rigidity in the linker region is essential to maintain the integrin in its inactive conformation (14). Linker rigidity sets αVβ3 apart from integrins αIIbβ3 and αXβ2. Ectodomain-TM domain linkers were disordered in αIIbβ3 and αXβ2 crystal structures, suggesting flexibility (18, 19). Furthermore, disulfide cross-linking of the αIIb and β3 linkers on intact αIIbβ3 on cell surfaces demonstrated lack of a specific interface (15). Several other features of αVβ3 crystal structures appear unusual. The βI MIDAS locates in between two other divalent metal-binding sites, the adjacent to MIDAS (ADMIDAS) and synergistic metal-binding site (SyMBS). αVβ3 was found to lack metal ions at the MIDAS and SyMBS, but to contain them when a ligand was soaked in, and metal ions were suggested to regulate ligand binding (14, 20). In contrast, αIIbβ3 with an identical β-subunit, binds metal ions at all three sites in absence of ligand (18, 21). αVβ3 has been reported to have clear density at its β-knee (14), in contrast to αIIbβ3 (18). A specific, stabilizing interface between the αV and β3 knees was reported that is unusual for containing many hydrogen bonds between highly solvent-accessible carbonyl and carboxyl groups (14). Such carboxyls are considered to be deprotonated at physiologic pH, and interactions between oxygen lone pair electrons are highly unfavorable. A specificity-determining loop (SDL) in the βI domain of the β3 subunit near the ligand-binding interface with the α-subunit was built markedly differently in a 2004 αIIbβ3 crystal structure (4) than in the 2001 αVβ3 crystal structure (22). The conformation in αVβ3 was retained in the 2009 crystal structure (14), perhaps implying an influence of the α-subunit on the conformation of the nearby SDL in β3. To obtain an independent view of integrin αVβ3, we have determined a structure of its ectodomain fused to coiled-coil peptides to mimic associating TM α-helices (αVβ3-AB). Furthermore, to better address special issues raised by the αVβ3-1TM structure, we carefully examined this structure and its underlying electron density. After doing so, we decided that it would benefit from re-refinement. Therefore, we report here two different αVβ3 crystal structures. Using these structures and their objective electron density, we report several novel structural features, and come to novel conclusions",PMC,pos,1,pos,3114,pos_PMC,0.99549675,1

23142976,"Noncanonical E2 recruitment by the autophagy E1 revealed by Atg7-Atg3 and Atg7-Atg10 structures. INTRODUCTION. In the eukaryotic process of autophagy, or ‘self-eating’, a double-membrane phagophore, the precursor to an autophagosome, engulfs a portion of the cytoplasm and the latter then fuses with lysosomes or the vacuole for degradation of the cytosolic contents. This can allow recycling of macromolecules when cells are starved of nutrients, or elimination of defective or unneeded organelles or cytoplasmic assemblies. Core functions of autophagy are mediated by noncanonical ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) cascades. Best-characterized in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the two UBLs Atg8 and Atg12 are both activated by the same E1 enzyme, Atg7, which by mechanisms that are not well understood, directs each UBL to an E2 enzyme, Atg3 or Atg10, respectively. Ultimately, the Atg7 and Atg3 cascade ligates Atg8’s C-terminal Gly to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Here a tilde (~) denotes thioester- or peptide-bonded covalent complexes. Atg8~PE adducts are incorporated into the growing autophagosomal membrane in a process that is critical for its expansion, and Atg8 also recruits cargo during selective autophagy. The other autophagic UBL, Atg12, functions after Atg7 and Atg10-mediated ligation to Atg5 to enhance Atg8 lipidation. The importance of Atg7, Atg3, Atg10, and other components of the Atg8 and Atg12 ligation pathways is reflected by numerous pathologies observed in cells, tissues, and/or animals lacking these proteins. Thus, it is of great significance to understand molecular mechanisms underlying UBL conjugation in autophagy. Enzymes in the Atg8 and Atg12 conjugation cascades are termed ‘noncanonical’ due to substantial differences from those for UBLs such as ubiquitin, NEDD8, and SUMO. Unlike progress in understanding the structural characteristics of enzymes involved in canonical UBL conjugation cascades, our knowledge of the noncanonical features underlying Atg8 and Atg12 conjugation remains relatively rudimentary. Briefly, in canonical UBL cascades, as well as noncanonical cascades in autophagy, an E1’s structurally conserved adenylation domain binds the UBL and catalyzes its C-terminal adenylation. However, in Atg7, the adenylation domain is a symmetric homodimer, with two identical UBL-binding and adenylation active sites, whereas the adenylation domains from canonical E1s are pseudosymmetric and contain only a single UBL binding and adenylation active site. The UBL C terminus subsequently becomes covalently attached to the E1 catalytic cysteine via a thioester bond. In canonical E1s, the catalytic cysteine is housed in a distinct domain, which undergoes remarkable structural remodeling to form an E1~UBL thioester intermediate. By contrast, Atg7’s cysteine is in a flexible loop that crosses over the UBL-binding surface and approaches an autophagy UBL’s C-terminal Gly in the adenylation active site. Thus, structurally, Atg7 has a single C-terminal domain (CTD) that contains the elements both for UBL adenylation and forming the Atg7~UBL thioester intermediate. Next, a UBL thioester is transferred to an E2 catalytic cysteine, in order to ultimately shuttle the activated UBL to targets. However, the mechanisms by which canonical and noncanonical E1s recruit their E2s differ completely. Canonical E1s recruit their cognate E2s via a selective ‘ubiquitin-fold domain’ (ufd) at the C terminus of the same subunit that also harbors the adenylation active site and catalytic cysteine. By contrast, Atg7 lacks a ufd, and instead has a unique ‘N-terminal domain’ (NTD) that binds autophagic E2s. For Atg3 this was shown to utilize a unique ‘trans’ architecture: Atg3 binds the NTD of one Atg7, and receives Atg8 from the catalytic cysteine of the opposite Atg7 molecule in the homodimer. The autophagy E2s also have distinctive features that raise questions about how both Atg3 and Atg10 could bind Atg7. First, Atg3 and Atg10 share little sequence homology. Although they both have core structures resembling a canonical E2 catalytic domain, with a concave β-sheet ‘backside’ and the catalytic cysteine at the ‘front’, their mechanisms of E1 binding are apparently noncanonical. Atg3 lacks any known catalytic residues other than the active site cysteine, and also has a unique ‘flexible region’ (FR) that binds Atg7 and a distinctive ‘handle region’ (HR) required for downstream steps in Atg8 lipidation. A prior structure of a short peptide from the Atg3 FR bound to the isolated Atg7 NTD revealed the basis for their high affinity interactions, although additional contact surfaces were implied. Also, it is unclear how Atg10 binds Atg7: Atg10 lacks an obvious FR sequence, and an Atg7 mutant at the Atg3FR-binding interface is defective for the Atg3 pathway but not for the Atg10 pathway in vivo. Seemingly paradoxically, the isolated Atg3FR competes with Atg10 for Atg7-binding in vitro, and the Atg7 binding site on Atg3FR is not accessible in the prior structure of full-length Atg3. Thus, to gain insights into how the autophagy E1 recognizes its E2s, we determined crystal structures of Atg7–Atg3 and Atg7–Atg10 complexes from S. cerevisiae. The structures show how a single E1 enzyme uses the same surfaces to recognize distinctive features of two different E2s, and how conformational changes and unique molecular architectures mediate active site juxtaposition for the noncanonical E1–E2 complexes in autophagy. RESULTS. MULTISITE RECRUITMENT OF ATG3 AND ATG10 TO ATG7. To visualize the juxtaposition of E1 and E2 catalytic cysteines, which is required for UBL transfer, we performed crosslinking as follows: we purified versions of Atg3 and Atg10 containing only a single cysteine at the active site, reacted the homobifunctional sulfhydryl crosslinker bismaleimidoethane (BMOE) with each E2, and desalted excess crosslinker. For Atg3, we added a version of Atg7 lacking the C-terminal 17-residues disordered in prior crystals, and for Atg10 we added a version of Atg7 with this truncation and C39S C195S C375A mutations to re",PMC,pos,1,pos,3125,pos_PMC,0.9920312,1

In another study, transplanted SCs transduced to generate a bifunctional neurotrophin (D15A) led to significant increases in graft SCs and axons, including supraspinal and myelinated axons. Here we studied the growth and myelination of local and supraspinal axons and functional outcome following the combination of rolipram administration and neurotrophin-transduced SC implantation after SCI. Rolipram was administered subcutaneously for 4 weeks immediately after contusion at vertebral T8 (25.0-mm weight drop, MASCIS impactor).

SC myelinated axons were increased significantly in GFP SC with rolipram-treated animals compared to animals receiving SCI alone. Rolipram administered with either GFP or GFP-D15A SCs significantly increased numbers of brain stem-derived axons below the lesion/implant area and improved hindlimb function. Compared to the single treatments, the combination led to the largest SC grafts, the highest numbers of serotonergic fibers in the grafts, and increased numbers of axons from the reticular formation below the lesion/implant area and provided the greatest improvement in hindlimb function.

We used NMR spectroscopy to perform a per residue level characterization of the molecular interactions between the unfolded domains 2 and 3 of NS5A (NS5A-D2 and NS5A-D3), CypA, and NS5B(Δ21). We show that three regions of NS5A-D2 (residues 250-262 (region A), 274-287 (region B), and 306-333 (region C)) interact with NS5B(Δ21), whereas NS5A-D3 does not. We show that both NS5B(Δ21) and CypA share a common binding site on NS5A that contains residues Pro-306 to Glu-323. No direct molecular interaction has been detected by NMR spectroscopy between HCV NS5B(Δ21) and host CypA. We show that cyclosporine A added to a sample containing NS5B(Δ21), NS5A-D2, and CypA specifically inhibits the interaction between CypA and NS5A-D2 without altering the one between NS5A-D2 and NS5B(Δ21). A high quality heteronuclear NMR spectrum of HCV NS5B(Δ21) has been obtained and was used to characterize the binding site on the polymerase of NS5A-D2. Moreover these data highlight the potential of using NMR of NS5B(Δ21) as a powerful tool to characterize in solution the interactions of the HCV polymerase with all kinds of molecules (proteins, inhibitors, RNA). This work brings new insights into the comprehension of the molecular interplay between NS5B, NS5A, and CypA, three essentials proteins for HCV replication.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3128,pos_MEDLINE,0.99740905,1
23169033,"Babesia divergens and Neospora caninum apical membrane antigen 1 structures reveal selectivity and plasticity in apicomplexan parasite host cell invasion. Host cell invasion by the obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium (malaria) and Toxoplasma (toxoplasmosis), requires a step-wise mechanism unique among known host-pathogen interactions. A key step is the formation of the moving junction (MJ) complex, a circumferential constriction between the apical tip of the parasite and the host cell membrane that traverses in a posterior direction to enclose the parasite in a protective vacuole essential for intracellular survival. The leading model of MJ assembly proposes that Rhoptry Neck Protein 2 (RON2) is secreted into the host cell and integrated into the membrane where it serves as the receptor for apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) on the parasite surface. We have previously demonstrated that the AMA1-RON2 interaction is an effective target for inhibiting apicomplexan invasion. To better understand the AMA1-dependant molecular recognition events that promote invasion, including the significant AMA1-RON2 interaction, we present the structural characterization of AMA1 from the apicomplexan parasites Babesia divergens (BdAMA1) and Neospora caninum (NcAMA1) by X-ray crystallography. These studies offer intriguing structural insight into the RON2-binding surface groove in the AMA1 apical domain, which shows clear evidence for receptor-ligand co-evolution, and the hyper variability of the membrane proximal domain, which in Plasmodium is responsible for direct binding to erythrocytes. By incorporating the structural analysis of BdAMA1 and NcAMA1 with existing AMA1 structures and complexes we were able to define conserved pockets in the AMA1 apical groove that could be targeted for the design of broadly reactive therapeutics.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3131,pos_MEDLINE,0.99760324,1
23222643,"FMNL3 FH2-actin structure gives insight into formin-mediated actin nucleation and elongation. SUMMARY. Formins are actin assembly factors that act in a variety of actin-based processes. The conserved formin homology 2 (FH2) domain promotes filament nucleation and influences elongation via interaction with the barbed end. FMNL3 is a formin that induces assembly of filopodia but whose FH2 domain is a poor nucleator. The 3.4 Å structure of an FMNL3 FH2 dimer in complex with tetramethylrhodamine-actin uncovers details of formin-regulated actin elongation. We observe distinct FH2-actin binding regions; interactions in the knob and coiled-coil subdomains are necessary for actin binding while those in the lasso/post interface are important for the stepping mechanism. Biochemical and cellular experiments test the importance of individual residues for function. This structure provides details for FH2 mediated filament elongation via processive capping and supports a model in which C-terminal non-FH2 residues of FMNL3 are required to stabilize the filament nucleus. INTRODUCTION. The dynamic nature of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for a variety of cellular processes and is controlled by a large number of actin binding proteins. The formin family of actin assembly factors, influencing both actin nucleation and elongation, is central to the regulation of many actin-based processes. Formins are characterized by the presence of formin homology 1 (FH1) and formin homology 2 (FH2) domains generally found toward the carboxy-terminus. The FH1 contains multiple poly-proline repeats that interact with profilin bound actin monomers The adjacent FH2 domain functions as a homodimer. Crystal structures of FH2 domains from Bni1p, mDia1, and DAAM1 have been solved. All are highly conserved alpha helical structures, which combine to create a ring-shaped head-to-tail dimer mediated by two equivalent “lasso/post” interactions. A flexible linker of varying length allows considerable flexibility in orientation of the subunits. Both FH2 subunits interact with the barbed end of actin and are able to bind and release from the terminal actin subunits as polymerization occurs, allowing processive movement with the elongating filament. A mechanism for FH2 mediated capping has been proposed in which the FH2 domain moves as a Brownian ratchet during filament elongation, with additional insights on the mechanism of processivity coming from biochemical and modeling studies. The structure of the FH2 domain of Bni1p bound to actin (Bni1p FH2-actin) provided the basis for the ratchet model by capturing a step in the mechanism during which the FH2 domains were interacting with three actin subunits. Although biochemical studies suggest that Bni1p FH2 is an extremely stable dimer, in the Bni1p FH2-actin structure the FH2 is not dimeric, but rather forms a helical concatenation of several Bni1p monomers in head-to-tail fashion that is unlikely to be formed under physiological conditions. Formin FH2 domains vary dramatically in both their nucleation and elongation activities, and this range of activities provides the potential for wide range control of cell morphology. Some formins, including FMNL3, require not only the FH1 and FH2, but also the C-terminus for potent nucleation suggesting even broader functionality across the protein family. To investigate the mechanism by which formins nucleate actin filaments and promote elongation, we determined the high resolution structure of an actin-formin complex. Our 3.4 Å crystal structure of the FH2 domain of FMNL3 bound to tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled actin represents the first mammalian formin to be crystallized in the presence of actin and visualizes an additional step in processive elongation. Furthermore, it suggests an explanation for the poor nucleation ability of FMNL3’s FH2 domain and allows us to propose a model for FMNL3 nucleation that requires actin monomer binding independently by both the FH2 domain and the C-terminus. STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of the FH2 domain of FMNL3 (amino acids 555 – 954) in complex with tetramethylrhodamine-actin (TMR-actin) to 3.4 Å (Table 1, Fig 1). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two heterotetramers packed together in a head-to-head manner (Supplementary Fig. 1), with the presumed biological unit being composed of two actin monomers and two FH2 domains (Supplementary Fig. 1). Within each actin-FH2 tetramer, the two FH2 domains interact in a head-to-tail orientation encircling the barbed end of two actin monomers (Fig. 1). When the FMNL3/actin complex used for crystallization was analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation, we observed a single species with a molecular weight of 166 kDa +/- 15 kDa (Supplementary Fig. 1), corresponding to the 2:2 complex of FH2:actin observed in the crystal structure. The head-to-head packing of tetramers is quite different from the structure of Bni1p bound to TMR-actin, in which the actin subunits form a flat actin polymer with FH2 domains spiraling around it (Supplementary Fig. 1). Due to the helical arrangement of subunits in the Bni1p FH2-actin structure, symmetric dimerization was not observed between FH2 domains (Supplementary Fig. 1) and each copy of the asymmetric unit contained a single FH2 bound actin subunit. In contrast, the FMNL3/actin complex shows two-fold (non-crystallographic) symmetry (Fig. 1). The overall structural features of the FMNL3 FH2 monomers are similar to other existing formin FH2 domain structures, each having five subdomains: lasso, linker, knob, coiled-coil, and post (Fig. 1). The structure of the FH2 domain core is conserved among formins for which crystal structures are available, and the head-to-tail dimer of FMNL3 FH2, in which the lasso of each monomer wraps around the post of its partner, has been observed in the structures of the yeast Bni1p and human DAAM1. Two aromatic residues in the lasso, Trp576 and Phe589 in FMNL3, are highly conserved in formins (Supplementary Fig. 2) and presumably hel",PMC,pos,1,pos,3139,pos_PMC,0.99783,1
23233669,"βIII spectrin regulates the structural integrity and the secretory protein transport of the Golgi complex. A spectrin-based cytoskeleton is associated with endomembranes, including the Golgi complex and cytoplasmic vesicles, but its role remains poorly understood. Using new generated antibodies to specific peptide sequences of the human βIII spectrin, we here show its distribution in the Golgi complex, where it is enriched in the trans-Golgi and trans-Golgi network. The use of a drug-inducible enzymatic assay that depletes the Golgi-associated pool of PI4P as well as the expression of PH domains of Golgi proteins that specifically recognize this phosphoinositide both displaced βIII spectrin from the Golgi. However, the interference with actin dynamics using actin toxins did not affect the localization of βIII spectrin to Golgi membranes. Depletion of βIII spectrin using siRNA technology and the microinjection of anti-βIII spectrin antibodies into the cytoplasm lead to the fragmentation of the Golgi. At ultrastructural level, Golgi fragments showed swollen distal Golgi cisternae and vesicular structures. Using a variety of protein transport assays, we show that the endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi and post-Golgi protein transports were impaired in βIII spectrin-depleted cells. However, the internalization of the Shiga toxin subunit B to the endoplasmic reticulum was unaffected. We state that βIII spectrin constitutes a major skeletal component of distal Golgi compartments, where it is necessary to maintain its structural integrity and secretory activity, and unlike actin, PI4P appears to be highly relevant for the association of βIII spectrin the Golgi complex.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3142,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.9737945,1
23255593,"The Arabidopsis B3 domain protein VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) is involved in processes essential for development, with structural and mutational studies revealing its DNA-binding surface. The B3 DNA-binding domain is a plant-specific domain found throughout the plant kingdom from the alga Chlamydomonas to grasses and flowering plants. Over 100 B3 domain-containing proteins are found in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and one of these is critical for accelerating flowering in response to prolonged cold treatment, an epigenetic process called vernalization. Despite the specific phenotype of genetic vrn1 mutants, the VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) protein localizes throughout the nucleus and shows sequence-nonspecific binding in vitro. In this work, we used a dominant repressor tag that overcomes genetic redundancy to show that VRN1 is involved in processes beyond vernalization that are essential for Arabidopsis development. To understand its sequence-nonspecific binding, we crystallized VRN1(208-341) and solved its crystal structure to 1.6 Å resolution using selenium/single-wavelength anomalous diffraction methods. The crystallized construct comprises the second VRN1 B3 domain and a preceding region conserved among VRN1 orthologs but absent in other B3 domains. We established the DNA-binding face using NMR and then mutated positively charged residues on this surface with a series of 16 Ala and Glu substitutions, ensuring that the protein fold was not disturbed using heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR spectra. The triple mutant R249E/R289E/R296E was almost completely incapable of DNA binding in vitro.

23383358,"T lymphocytes from chagasic patients are activated but lack proliferative capacity and down-regulate CD28 and CD3ζ. INTRODUCTION. Upon first contact with an infectious agent, antigen-specific T cells proliferate and rapidly expand their number in order to control or eliminate the microorganism [1]. After effective elimination of the pathogen, this antigen-driven cellular expansion is followed by an aptoptosis-mediated contraction. Successful identification of newly generated effector T cells has been described in several infectious diseases through the co-expression of surface activation markers, CD38 and HLA-DR [2]–[5]. Consistently, only a fraction of these activated CD38+/HLA-DR+ T cells can be detected after the acute infection has been removed [2], [4]. However, in some chronic infections, activated CD38+/HLA-DR+ T cells can be persistently expanded [6], [7] and to some extent correlate with disease progression [8], [9]. Simultaneously with this phenomenon, numerous cellular effector functions including cytokine production, cytotoxic potential and proliferative capacity becomes impaired, in a process termed lymphocyte exhaustion [10], [11]. Previously reported by our group, we show that chronic chagasic patients display higher percentages of CD4+/CD8+ (double-positive) peripheral T cells co-expressing CD38 and HLA-DR when compared with uninfected controls; in addition, the patients with severe cardiomyopathy produced less IFN-γ than those with non-cardiac involvement [12]. The role of the activated subpopulations of T cells in Chagas disease control or pathogenesis requires additional research. Chagas disease is a chronic parasitic infection caused by the hemoflagellated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Clinically, it is possible to distinguish an acute and a chronic phase. After recovery from acute infection most of the individuals remain asymptomatic for several years and nearly 30% of them gradually develop tissue damage including chagasic cardiomyopathy or gastrointestinal involvement [13]. Experimental evidence suggests that the parasite's persistence and the related dysfunctional immune response may contribute to chronic tissue damage [12], [13]. It is claimed that T. cruzi persistence can disrupt the normal activation pathways of T lymphocytes and simultaneously induce their exhaustion. For example, patients with severe cardiac involvement had increased percentages of peripheral CD8+ memory T cells with terminal differentiated phenotype (CD8+/CD27−/CD28−) [14] and decreased capacity to produce a T. cruzi-specific IFN-γ response than those with mild compromise [12], [15]–[17]. Similarly, severe clinical status in Chagas has been associated with higher expression of inhibitory markers (CTLA-4) on CD8+ T cells [17], CD57 expression and spontaneous apoptosis on CD4+ T cells [18]. Data on T cell activation in chronic Chagas disease is diverse and the evidence can be categorized as follows: a) some studies showed that HLA-DR+ expression on CD3+ [19] or CD4+ [20] cells augments in T. cruzi infected patients, but does not vary with disease severity; b) other authors did not found differences between chronically infected patients and controls, whether adults [21], [22] or children were being evaluated [23]; and finally c) other found differences when patients were classified according to disease stage or severity. Specifically, the reports suggest that the percentage of CD4+/HLA-DR+ T cells decreases in the “early-chronic” chagasic children [24], while the CD8+/HLA-DR+ increases in patients with severe cardiac involvement [20], [24]. In other chronic infectious models, similar cellular features as those described above have been related to changes in the expression of molecules involved in T cell activation and downstream signaling. Notably, CD28 and CD3ζ chain down-regulation has been described in several antigen-persistent infectious models and related with diminished proliferation and reduced IFN-γ production on T cells [25], [26]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the activation status, through the co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR, the proliferative potential and the expression of CD28 and CD3ζ chain on T lymphocytes between chronic chagasic patients and uninfected controls.

23396847,"Defining a protective epitope on factor H binding protein, a key meningococcal virulence factor and vaccine antigen. Mapping of epitopes recognized by functional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is essential for understanding the nature of immune responses and designing improved vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. In recent years, identification of B-cell epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies has facilitated the design of peptide-based vaccines against highly variable pathogens like HIV, respiratory syncytial virus, and Helicobacter pylori; however, none of these products has yet progressed into clinical stages. Linear epitopes identified by conventional mapping techniques only partially reflect the immunogenic properties of the epitope in its natural conformation, thus limiting the success of this approach. To investigate antigen-antibody interactions and assess the potential of the most common epitope mapping techniques, we generated a series of mAbs against factor H binding protein (fHbp), a key virulence factor and vaccine antigen of Neisseria meningitidis. The interaction of fHbp with the bactericidal mAb 12C1 was studied by various epitope mapping methods. Although a 12-residue epitope in the C terminus of fHbp was identified by both Peptide Scanning and Phage Display Library screening, other approaches, such as hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (MS) and X-ray crystallography, showed that mAb 12C1 occupies an area of ∼1,000 Å(2) on fHbp, including >20 fHbp residues distributed on both N- and C-terminal domains. Collectively, these data show that linear epitope mapping techniques provide useful but incomplete descriptions of B-cell epitopes, indicating that increased efforts to fully characterize antigen-antibody interfaces are required to understand and design effective immunogens.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3184,pos_MEDLINE,0.98835784,1

23462742,"Structural basis for the interaction of unstructured neuron specific substrates neuromodulin and neurogranin with Calmodulin. Neuromodulin (Nm) and neurogranin (Ng) are neuron-specific substrate proteins belonging to the calpacitin protein family123. Nm and Ng share high sequence similarity spanning a 20-amino-acid region that contains an IQ motif (I/L/V)QXXXRXXXX(R/K). Both proteins bind to Calmodulin (CaM) through this IQ motif under a low Ca2+ micro-environment and dissociate when Ca2+ levels increase12. In resting neurons, much of the CaM is associated with Nm/Ng in the membrane4. Nm is a 23.6 kDa protein localized at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane in the presynaptic terminals of axons. During neural development, Nm accumulates in axonal growth cones and helps their navigation toward appropriate target sites5. In addition, Nm is involved in neurite extension and neuronal plasticity, neuroregeneration, regulation of neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminal, and in the long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic efficiency6. In the nervous system, Nm becomes phosphorylated during LTP in the hippocampal area, CA17. Further, Nm contributes to synaptic plasticity by controlling the levels of presynaptically available CaM48. Overexpression of Nm is accompanied by enhanced learning and regenerative capabilities9, with recent studies suggesting that protein kinase C (PKC)-induced phosphorylation of Nm differentially regulates the performance of three diverse memory-associated tasks10. Ng, on the other hand, is a 7.6 kDa protein that is expressed at postsynaptic cytosol loci in several telencephalic areas in mammals, such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, striatum and olfactory bulb2. Its expression is controlled by thyroid hormone11, and vitamin A12, and is developmentally regulated, with relatively low levels of expression observed in the embryonic and neonatal stages followed by dramatic increases from about 2–3 weeks of age in the rodent brain13. While Ng enhances synaptic strength through its interaction with CaM14, Ser36 phosphorylation renders Ng unable to bind to either CaM or phosphatidic acid1516. Ng knockout strongly diminishes the LTP and slightly enhances long-term depression (LTD)17. Similar to Nm, Ng plays an important role in the neuroplasticity mechanism of learning and memory. Ng mutants that lack the ability to bind to CaM, or dissociate from CaM, are unable to potentiate synaptic transmissions, strongly suggesting that regulated Ng-CaM binding is necessary for Ng-mediated potentiation1819. In combination with a review of the literature, the present study has revealed that Nm and Ng are intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUP) under in-vitro physiological conditions1. These proteins have very little or no secondary structure and lack a compact globular fold. Moreover, previous studies have revealed that Nm and Ng interact with CaM through their IQ motifs, which assume an α-helical structure upon binding to CaM2021222324. To gain insight into the specific recognition of CaM by these intrinsically unstructured proteins, we investigated the biophysical interactions and structure of Nm/Ng and IQ motif peptides in association with CaM. Besides, the functional studies were performed to validate our findings. RESULTS. NM AND NG ARE INTRINSICALLY UNSTRUCTURED PROTEINS. RESIDUAL SECONDARY STRUCTURE FROM FAR UV-CD. CD spectra of Nm and Ng showed an intense minimum at 201 and 204 nm respectively, indicating the presence of disordered regions in these proteins. The CD analysis further supports that Nm and Ng both have residual secondary structural elements (mainly α-helix) and suggests that these two proteins exist in a premolten globular conformational state of protein quartet model25 under physiological conditions (Supplementary Figure 2A). NMR SPECTROSCOPY SUGGESTS NM AND NG ARE NATIVELY UNFOLDED PROTEINS. 1H NMR is a sensitive method capable of distinguishing between folded and unfolded proteins through a small dispersion of the amide backbone chemical shift26. Particularly, the appearance of a large and broad signal at approximately 8.3 ppm is an indicator for a disordered protein. On the other hand, signal dispersion beyond 8.5 ppm (8.5–11 ppm) indicates a folded protein. Further, in the aliphatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum between +1.0 and −1.0 ppm, large-signal dispersion versus a steep flank of the dominant peak at approximately 1.0 ppm will separate a structured protein from an unfolded protein26. The NMR spectra of full-length Nm and Ng were very similar to those previously observed for other unstructured proteins (Supplementary Figures 2B and 2C). The resonance of both protein's methyl group protons (at 0.9 and 0.95 ppm) and amide groups (around 8.4 ppm), along with very limited spectral dispersion of these signals, indicated the lack of a stable tertiary structure in both Nm and Ng (Supplementary Figures 2B and 2C). The observed intense H-alpha peaks might be due to 1) a reduced exchange of H-alpha with D2O26 in the sample; and 2) the unstructured nature of these two proteins1. Nm and Ng have a low percentage of order-promoting amino acids and high percentage of disorder-promoting amino acids (Supplementary table 1). The acidic pI and low hydrophobicity of these two proteins indicates that they are unfolded (See supplementary text). Besides, gel filtration chromatography and Dynamic Light Scattering experiments show the higher hydrodynamic radii and molecular weight for both Nm and Ng (See supplementary text). Thus, the biophysical studies on Nm and Ng support the classification of these proteins as intrinsically unstructured, lacking a compact globular fold, and having very little secondary structure272829. ISOTHERMAL TITRATION CALORIMETRY. The sequence alignment of known CaM binding peptides showed that each has one or two key aromatic residues, a few basic amino acids (located at N or C terminal) and other hydrophobic amino acids (Figure 1).

23499019,"The three-dimensional structure of the biotin carboxylase-biotin carboxyl carrier protein complex of E. coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase. SUMMARY. Acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) carboxylase is a biotin-dependent, multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the regulated step in fatty acid synthesis. The Escherichia coli enzyme is composed of a homodimeric biotin carboxylase (BC), biotinylated biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), and an α2β2 heterotetrameric carboxyltransferase. This enzyme complex catalyzes two half-reactions to form malonylcoenzyme A. BC and BCCP participate in the first half-reaction, whereas carboxyltransferase and BCCP are involved in the second. Three-dimensional structures have been reported for the individual subunits; however, the structural basis for how BCCP reacts with the carboxylase or transferase is unknown. Therefore, we report here the crystal structure of E. coli BCCP complexed with BC to a resolution of 2.49 Å. The protein-protein complex shows a unique quaternary structure and two distinct interfaces for each BCCP monomer. These BCCP binding sites are unique compared to phylogenetically related biotin-dependent carboxylases and therefore provide novel targets for developing antibiotics against bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase. INTRODUCTION. Biotin-dependent acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) catalyzes the regulated step in fatty acid synthesis in all domains of life. In Escherichia coli, ACC is made up of three components: biotin carboxylase (BC), biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), and carboxyltransferase (CT) (Cronan and Waldrop, 2002). The first step in the enzymatic reaction, catalyzed by BC, is the ATP-dependent carboxylation of the vitamin biotin (Figure 1), which is covalently attached to a specific lysine residue (Lys122) of BCCP. The second half-reaction carried out by CT is the transfer of the carboxyl group from the 1′N of carboxybiotin to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) to form malonyl-CoA (Figure 1). The genes encoding BC (Li and Cronan, 1992a) and CT (Li and Cronan, 1992b) have been cloned, overexpressed (Blanchard et al., 1999b; Blanchard and Waldrop, 1998), retain their enzymatic function in the absence of the other components, and utilize free biotin as a substrate instead of biotin linked to BCCP (Guchhait et al., 1974). The structure of E. coli BC has been determined in the absence of substrates (Thoden et al., 2000; Waldrop et al., 1994), with ATP analogs AMPPNP and ADPCF2P (Mochalkin et al., 2008), and with biotin, bicarbonate, and Mg-ADP (Chou et al., 2009). The structure of CT has also been determined (Bilder et al., 2006). In addition, the structure of the C-terminal domain of BCCP, which contains the biotinylated lysine, has been determined by X-ray crystallography (Athappilly and Hendrickson, 1995) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Yao et al., 1997). While the three-dimensional structures of the individual components have been of inestimable value, the fact remains that BCCP is the substrate for BC and CT, and therefore, what is lacking is a structure of either the biotin carboxyl carrier protein-biotin carboxylase (BCCP-BC) complex or the biotin carboxyl carrier protein-carboxyltransferase complex. It was found that a stable BCCP-BC complex formed when purifying BCCP from an E. coli strain that coexpressed both proteins (Nenortas and Beckett, 1996), while Choi-Rhee and Cronan (2003) suggested that the stoichiometry of the protein complex was one BC homodimer bound to four BCCP molecules. Thus, since BC and BCCP form a complex, we undertook the determination of the crystal structure of that protein-protein interaction. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli BCCP-BC complex determined at 2.49 Å resolution. The structure indicates a stoichiometry different from that previously reported (Choi-Rhee and Cronan, 2003) and reveals a quaternary structure for BC that has heretofore never been observed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. COPURIFICATION OF BCCP AND BC. The genes encoding BCCP (accB) and BC (accC) are located in an operon in the E. coli chromosome and are cotranscribed (James and Cronan, 2004). To mimic the in vivo arrangement, accB and accC were coexpressed using a minioperon where a histidine tag was put on the N terminus of BCCP. After purification by nickel affinity and size exclusion chromatography, the major peak contained the BCCP-BC complex, which was used for crystallization (Figure S1A available online). Gel electrophoresis showed a band at 50 kDa corresponding to the BC monomer and a band at ~22 kDa that is indicative of full-length BCCP (Figure S1B). The BCCP runs slightly higher than its 16.7 kDa molecular weight; this is thought to be caused by a pro/ala-rich linker in the middle of the protein (Li and Cronan, 1992a). Most importantly, the fact that the BCCP-BC complex remains intact after both nickel affinity and size exclusion chromatography suggests that the BCCP-BC interaction is indeed stable. QUATERNARY STRUCTURE. The overall structure of the BCCP-BC complex has D2 symmetry and is shown in Figures 2A–2C. One of the most striking features of the BCCP-BC complex is that two BC homodimers (which have C2 symmetry) come together to form a tetramer. If the BC tetramer is viewed by looking at one homodimer on top of the other, then it becomes readily apparent that the homodimers are rotated approximately 90° with respect to one another (Figure 2C). Tetrameric BC in the BCCP-BC complex is in stark contrast to the structures reported to date of BC, which have shown the enzyme to be a homodimer with C2 symmetry (Chou et al., 2009; Mochalkin et al., 2008; Thoden et al., 2000; Waldrop et al., 1994). Moreover, there are no packing interfaces in the crystals of BC alone that display the same dimer-dimer interaction as the BCCP-BC complex. The tetramer of BC is bound to four BCCP molecules where each BCCP molecule forms two interfaces. One interface is with a BC monomer located in the upper homodimer while the other is with a BC monomer in the lower homodimer of the tetramer (Figures 2A and 2B). Thus, the four BCCP molecules essential",PMC,pos,1,pos,3204,pos_PMC,0.99737346,1
23499022,"Structural and functional studies of the 252 kDa nucleoporin ELYS reveal distinct roles for its three tethered domains. SUMMARY. In metazoa, the nuclear envelope (NE), together with the embedded nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), breaks down and reassembles during cell division. It is suggested that ELYS, a nucleoporin, binds to chromatin in an initial step of postmitotic NPC assembly and subsequently recruits the essential Y-subcomplex, the major scaffolding unit of the NPC. Here, we show that ELYS contains three domains: an N-terminal β-propeller domain, a central α-helical domain and a C-terminal disordered region. While the disordered region is responsible for the interactions with chromatin, the two preceding domains synergistically mediate tethering to the NPC. We present the crystal structure of the seven-bladed β-propeller domain at 1.9 Å resolution. Analysis of the β-propeller surface reveals the regions that are required for NPC anchorage. We discuss the possible roles of ELYS in the context of the NPC scaffold architecture. INTRODUCTION. The compartmentalization of the genomic material into a membrane-enclosed organelle, the nucleus, is the central feature that distinguishes eukaryotes from prokaryotes. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are huge macromolecular assemblies that span the double membrane of the nuclear envelope (NE) and control transport into and out of the nucleus (Wente and Rout, 2010). Despite an estimated total mass of 40–60 MDa, these macromolecular assemblies are composed of only about 30 distinct proteins, nucleoporins (Nups), that are present in multiple copies, as dictated by the eight-fold rotational symmetry of NPCs (Beck et al., 2007; Brohawn and Schwartz, 2009a). In multicellular eukaryotes that undergo an open mitosis, NE breakdown (NEBD) is required during prophase for proper chromosome segregation (Güttinger et al., 2009; Asakawa et al., 2011). NEBD is accompanied by the disassembly of NPCs and by mixing of the nuclear compartment with the cytosol. Membrane-spanning nucleoporins are redistributed into the ER, which remains intact during mitosis, while the soluble nucleoporins are released into the cytosol as discrete subcomplexes (Hetzer et al., 2010). At the end of mitosis, NPCs reassemble from these subcomplexes in a defined order (Dultz and Ellenberg, 2010; Dultz et al., 2008). Whether NPCs reassemble before, during, or after the reformation of the NE is an ongoing debate (Antonin et al., 2005; Kiseleva et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2011). NPCs can also form during interphase by insertion into the intact double membrane of the NE. Many fungi undergo a closed mitosis without NEBD and thus rely exclusively on this type of NPC assembly. Recent data point to the mechanistic differences between post-mitotic and interphase NPC assembly (Rasala et al., 2008; Doucet et al., 2010; Doucet and Hetzer, 2010; Dultz and Ellenberg, 2010). Despite all efforts, though, the assembly of NPCs, which requires the coordination of ~500 proteins and the stabilization of highly curved openings in the NE, remains ill-defined (Bilokapic and Schwartz, 2011a). Generally, postmitotic NPC assembly is better understood than interphase assembly, because it can be assayed in vitro through nuclear reconstitution assays using Xenopus egg extracts. Postmitotic NPC assembly presumably begins with the binding of ELYS (embryonic large molecule derived from yolk sac) to chromatin and the subsequent recruitment of the essential Nup107-160 complex (Rasala et al., 2006; Franz et al., 2007; Gillespie et al., 2007). This complex is composed of 7 universally conserved proteins (Nup160, Nup133, Nup107, Nup96, Nup85, Sec13, and Seh1) as well as three additional nucleoporins (Nup43, Nup37, ELYS), found in Homo sapiens and most metazoans (Cronshaw et al., 2002; Loïodice et al., 2004; Rasala et al., 2006). Negative stain electron microscopy data of the homologous Nup84 complex from S. cerevisiae revealed a Y-shaped structure with two short arms and one long stalk (Siniossoglou et al., 2000; Lutzmann et al., 2002). Thus, due to the characteristic shape, the Nup107-160 complex is also known as the Y-complex. It has a crucial role in NPC assembly and pore-free nuclei with a continuous NE form in depleted Xenopus egg extracts (Walther et al., 2003; Harel et al., 2003). Time-course studies have revealed the sequential recruitment of nucleoporins to sites of postmitotic NPC reassembly (Dultz et al., 2008). ELYS is the earliest NPC component to be detected on the chromatin surface and on kinetochores, followed by the recruitment of the Y-complex (Franz et al. 2007). ELYS not only shows the same cellular localization as the Y-complex, but also interacts with it as shown by immunoprecipitation experiments in human cells and in Xenopus extracts (Rasala et al. 2006). The immunodepletion of ELYS from Xenopus nuclear reconstitution extracts abolished binding of the Y-complex to chromatin (Rasala et al., 2006; Franz et al., 2007). In the absence of ELYS in human cultured cells, NPC assembly occurred within ER membranes and triggered the formation of NPC studded annulate lamellae (Rasala et al., 2008). Thus, the association of ELYS with chromatin and the subsequent recruitment of the Y-complex are the earliest events in the post-mitotic assembly of nuclear pores. Next, the transmembrane nup Pom121 is recruited (Bodoor et al., 1999; Dultz et al., 2008), followed by the Nup93-containing subcomplex (Hase and Cordes, 2003; Dultz et al., 2008), which together with the Y-complex, builds the structural scaffold of the NPC (Bilokapic and Schwartz, 2011a). Finally, more peripheral nucleoporins are incorporated into newly forming pores. Large-scale RNAi analyses in C. elegans (Sonnichsen et al., 2005) showed that components of the Ran-cycle including RAN-1 (RanGTPase), RAN-2 (RanGAP), NPP-9 (RANBP1), IMB-1 (importin β) and IMA-2 (importin α), were required for proper Mel-28 (ELYS homolog in C. elegans) localization (Fernandez and Piano, 2006). In agreement, nuclear reconstitution assays using Xenopus egg extract showed that importin β and transportin",PMC,pos,1,pos,3206,pos_PMC,0.9980506,1
23519423,"Protein-peptide complex crystallization: a case study on the ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinase. 1. INTRODUCTION. Linear motifs (LMs) are simple protein–protein interaction tools which are generally less than 20 amino acids in length. They normally bind with only medium binding affinity (K d of ∼0.1–10 µM) to shallow protein-interaction surfaces on their binding partners (Neduva & Russell, 2005 ▶). As these protein–peptide-type inter­actions are becoming established as playing an equally important role as classical protein–protein associations in promoting biologically relevant binding events in the cell, there is great interest in structurally mapping out linear motif-binding protein surfaces. The Eukary­otic Linear Motif database contains thousands of occurrences of LMs in various organisms (Gould et al., 2010 ▶) and it is estimated that the human proteome may contain more than 10 000 LMs (Petsalaki & Russell, 2008 ▶). The moderate binding affinity of LM-containing peptides can hinder successful crystallization of the desired protein–peptide complex. Because linear motif-containing peptides are often unstructured alone and the energy gained upon crystal packing between symmetry mates may be on a par with the binding energy of the complex, the bona fide peptide-binding protein surface may mediate crystal packing rather than physiological LM binding. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-binding linear motifs bind to the MAPK docking groove and represent a functionally well characterized linear binding-motif class (Garai et al., 2012 ▶). Crystallization of docking-motif (D-motif) peptides with MAPKs may serve as a paradigm for the challenges of protein–peptide crystallization in general (Chang et al., 2002 ▶; Heo et al., 2004 ▶; Zhou et al., 2006 ▶; Liu et al., 2006 ▶; ter Haar et al., 2007 ▶; Ma et al., 2010 ▶; Garai et al., 2012 ▶). These short peptides are 7–17 amino acids in length; they are unstructured without their binding partners and they bind to their cognate MAPKs with binding affinities of 1–10 µM (Garai et al., 2012 ▶). Previously, we attempted the crystallization of three different MAPKs (ERK2, p38α and JNK1) with different linear D-motif-containing peptides to gain structural insight into their MAPK binding specificity (Garai et al., 2012 ▶). In this study, we describe our experiences in the crystallization of ERK2–docking peptide complexes. We set out to crystallize the wild-type protein (ERK2 WT) with six different peptides (Garai et al., 2012 ▶). Unfortunately, ERK2 readily crystallized in the apo form and we only managed to grow protein–peptide cocrystals with the docking peptide from MNK1 (pepMNK1), which is an ERK2 substrate. Analysis of crystal-packing contacts subsequently revealed that the protein–peptide binding surface of ERK2 WT was blocked by a symmetry-related kinase molecule in all apo crystals, while ERK2–pepMNK1 crystals could ‘luckily’ form because this peptide mediated a different type of crystal packing. The peptide was engaged in crystal contacts with an ERK2 symmetry molecule (Supplementary Fig. S11). Other peptides, however, could not mediate this unique crystal packing as they differed in length and sequence. Therefore, we decided to devise a strategy by which the trial-and-error nature of ERK2–docking peptide cocrystallization projects could be rationally alleviated. 2. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES. ERK2 (UniProt ID P28482) was expressed in E. coli with an N-­terminal histidine tag, which was subsequently removed using TEV protease. The protease cleavage leaves a glycine–serine dipeptide N-­terminal to the first ERK2 residue. The expression and purification of ERK2 is described in further detail in Garai et al. (2012 ▶). Briefly, recombinant ERK2 was subjected to affinity purification on Ni-Sepharose, cleaved using TEV protease and loaded onto a RESOURCE Q ion-exchange column. The protein was eluted using an NaCl gradient, concentrated to 10 mg ml−1 and stored in buffer (20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol pH 8) at 193 K. ERK2 surface mutations were introduced by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol and mutant proteins were expressed and purified in the same way as wild-type ERK2. All crystallization experiments were performed in standard sitting-drop vapour-diffusion setups at 296 K. ERK2 (150–200 µM) was crystallized using a twofold molar excess of chemically synthesized docking peptides in the presence of 2 mM AMPPNP and MgCl2. All peptides were synthesized on an ABI 431A peptide synthesizer using the Fmoc strategy. For each ERK2–docking peptide complex we used an in-house 96-­condition PEG-based grid screen. This screen consisted of only low ionic strength (less than 200 mM salt) conditions, in which the pH and molecular weight of the PEGs were systematically varied from pH 5.5 to 8.5 and from PEG 200 to PEG 20 000, respectively. In addition, we also used low ionic strength commercial sparse-matrix screens (The PEGs and PEGs II Suites from Qiagen) for the initial crystallization trials of all complexes. All crystals were flash-cooled after adding ∼15% glycerol to the mother liquor as a cryoprotectant. Crystals were tested on a Rigaku R200 rotating-anode X-ray generator at the Institute of Chemistry, Eötvös Loránd University and diffraction data sets were collected on the PXI or PXIII beamlines of the Swiss Light Source, Villigen, Switzerland. All data were processed with XDS (Kabsch, 2010 ▶). The phase problem was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007 ▶) using PDB entry 2gph (Zhou et al., 2006 ▶) as a starting model. Structure refinement was carried out using PHENIX (Adams et al., 2010 ▶) and structure remodelling and building was performed in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010 ▶) (Table 1 ▶). 3. RESULTS. MKK2 is one of the upstream activator kinases of ERK2 that binds its MAPK substrate with a linear docking motif (Garai et al., 2012 ▶). In order to explore the structural basis of this interaction, we attempted to crystallize ERK2 with a docking peptide from MKK2 (pepMKK2). Single crysta",PMC,pos,1,pos,3210,pos_PMC,0.99549675,1

23638119,"Structural insights into a wildtype domain of the oncoprotein E6 and its interaction with a PDZ domain. INTRODUCTION. Infections are responsible for 17.8% of all cancers [1]. Several human papilloma virus (HPV) types are the most frequent viral cancer-causing agents and are linked to well over half a million incidences of cervical cancer each year [1], [2], [3]. Though vaccines against HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 are available, these HPV types cover only ∼70% of cervical cancer cases and the vaccines do not cure already existing infections [3], [4]. Development of therapies against HPV-caused malignancies thus requires further mechanistic insight into how oncogenic HPV drive tumor development and maintenance. The HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 of tumor-associated so-called “high-risk” HPVs prevent the differentiation of HPV-infected keratinocytes and immortalize primary, cultured human keratinocytes [5], [6], [7]. Moreover, primary human cervical carcinoma cells require E6 and E7 expression for proliferation [8]. Upon depletion of E6 and/or E7, HPV-transformed cervical cancer derived cell lines undergo apoptosis or senescence [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Apoptotic HPV positive cancer cells may transform human primary fibroblasts by horizontal gene transfer of the E6/E7 ORF [15]. The double-stranded DNA genome of HPV is replicated as an episome in infected cells, but almost 90% of cervical carcinomas contain genome-integrated HPV sequences, encompassing at least the E6/E7 open reading frame (ORF) [16]. The integration and subsequent loss of episomal HPV sequences leads to absence of E2 which usually negatively regulates the transcription of E6/E7 [16]. Collectively these findings suggest that the “malicious couple” E6 and E7 is necessary for formation and maintenance of cervical cancer. The HPV oncoprotein E6 has no known enzymatic activity. It interacts with numerous cellular proteins and these interactions contribute to reprogramming keratinocytes so as to prevent normal differentiation and to maintain cellular replication competence in order to amplify the HPV genome [17], [18]. The inactivation of p53 is a general hallmark of tumorigenesis and tumors frequently show mutations and/or reduced p53 levels [19]. E6 interacts with p53 [20] and the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP [21]. The E6 interaction leads to an alteration of the substrate specificity of E6AP ultimately resulting in proteasomal p53 degradation [22], [23]. E6 also induces p53 degradation independent of E6AP [24] and also independent of ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation [25]. Interestingly, p53 degradation is a common mode of action of the high-risk HPVs and is rarely found for other HPV types [26], [27]. A second common feature of tumors constitutes an increase in telomerase activity [19]. This increase results both from direct interaction of E6 with the enzyme and via induction of telomerase reverse transcriptase at the transcriptional level [28], [29]. Again, this property appears to be shared primarily among the oncogenic HPV types such as e.g. HPV 16, 18 and 51 [30]. Furthermore, E6 of high-risk types interacts with a number of PDZ-domain containing proteins (PDZ proteins) via its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (PDZ-BM) [31], [32]. These PDZ proteins, usually containing multiple PDZ domains, act frequently as hub proteins in signaling and/or regulation of cell polarity and are typically degraded upon E6 interaction [31]. Deletion of the PDZ-BM from the high-risk type HPV 31 E6 results in a retarded growth-rate of infected cells and a reduced copy number of the viral episome [33]. The absence of the PDZ-BM of HPV 16 E6 in an in vivo mouse model resulted in smaller cervical tumors [34]. This strongly suggests a tumor promoting mechanism based upon E6’s targeting of PDZ proteins. Interestingly, PDZ proteins are common targets for human tumorigenic and nontumorigenic viruses [35], [36]. The proteins targeted by these viruses control formation of tight junctions, cell adhesion and apoptosis [36]. This targeting appears to be a common strategy to support viral replication and transmission to new hosts. A prominent case here constitutes the observation that one single mutation in the PDZ-BM of the envelope protein of rabies virus dramatically changed its PDZ protein target spectrum and resulted in a switch from the virulent to an attenuated state [37]. One PDZ domain containing protein targeted by E6 for degradation in vivo is the multi-domain protein hDlg (human Dlg/hDlg1/SAP-97) [38]. The E6 dependent reduction of hDlg levels has been demonstrated by an in vitro degradation assay for a number of high-risk HPVs, among them HPV 16, 18 and 51 [32]. Human Dlg is part of the Scribble polarity complex that controls basolateral polarity [39] and it is required for adherens junction formation and differentiation of epithelial cells [40]. Human Dlg is expressed in human keratinocytes and localizes to nuclear, cytoplasmic, membrane-associated and cytoskeletal pools that are thought to exert different functions [41]. Different isoforms of hDlg with different cellular localization and translation efficiency by alternative splicing [41], [42]. The hDlg-APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) complex negatively regulates cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to S phase [43] and hDlg-depleted keratinocytes show an increased resistance to anoikis [44]. Human Dlg recruits the Src homology 3 domain-containing (RhoG-specific) guanine nucleotide exchange factor (SGEF) to the cytoskeleton and induces SGEF activity [45]. Interestingly, this cytoskeletal pool of hDlg is not degraded by E6 [45]. Moreover, E6 interacts with SGEF in an hDlg-dependent manner and maintains high RhoG activity, thereby increasing invasive capacity [45]. Thus, the role of hDlg in tumor formation seems to be ambivalent and E6 apparently specifically abrogates certain tumorsuppressive hDlg activities [41]. Full-length E6 consists of approximately 150 residues and includes two zinc-binding domains (ZBDs) each coordinating one zinc ion via cysteines arranged in a motif of the form CXXC",PMC,pos,1,pos,3238,pos_PMC,0.99727964,1

KDO8PS is evolutionarily and structurally related to the first enzyme of the shikimate pathway, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS), which uses erythrose 4-phosphate in place of A5P. Both KDO8PS and type Iβ DAH7PS enzymes adopt similar homotetrameric associations with their active sites close to one of the interfaces. The conserved PAFLxR motif in KDO8PS and the corresponding GARNxQ motif in type Iβ DAH7PS, both on the short β4-α4 loop of the (β/α)8 barrel, form part of this interface and provide key contacts with substrates. This (112)PAFLxR(117) motif was mutated in Neisseria meningitidis KDO8PS in order to assess its role in enzyme function. Arg117 extends across the interface to provide guanidinium functionality in the A5P binding site of the adjacent subunit. Substitution Arg117Ala severely hampered catalysis, whereas substitution to Lys was tolerated better. Mutation of Phe114 to either Arg or Ala results in active proteins, but with substantially elevated Km(A5P) values. Mutant proteins that combine substitutions in this motif demonstrate poor catalytic function, and, although these mutated residues now structurally resemble their counterparts in the GARNxQ motif of type Iβ DAH7PS, no DAH7PS-like activity was observed.

We present crystal structures of a signaling-competent fragment of R-spondin 1 (Rspo1) at a resolution of 2.0 Å and its complex with the LGR5 ectodomain at a resolution of 3.2 Å.

Next to lactic acid bacteria and the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, the non-pathogenic and human faecal isolate which despite exhibiting a serotype (O6:K5:H1) E. coli strain nissle 1917 (EcN) is one of the best characterized probiotics and effectively colonize in the gut [1]. The gut microorganisms form a complex and dynamic ecosystem that constantly interacts pollutants through contaminate food and water, that may have toxic effects on body results induction of a variety of stress proteins. Heavy metals are one of the major hazard pollutants, constantly added into the environment due to anthropogenic activities. This is especially true for developing countries like China and India [2]. When organisms or cells are exposed to low or high levels of heavy metals they adapt various types including physiological or genetic changes in response to heavy metals. So, metalinduced toxicity involves multifactor mechanisms, suggests that the toxicity of metal ions binding for metal sensitive group, especially those with high atomic numbers, e.g. Hg2+, Cd2+ and Ag+2, tend to bind SH or His moieties. Regarding health issues, Cd, Pb, Hg and as have been identified as the most toxic. Mercury (Hg), is a high potential contaminant because of its toxic nature. It exhibits neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity [3–6]. A comparison of protein patterns from stress conditions versus controls allows the detection of specific changes in the protein [7]. As result examining the protein expression that are up or down regulated could be useful for gaining insight into the molecular mechanisms of stress response [8]. Most of the proteomic investigate that have been performed to study the toxicity of heavy metals in different organisms have shown that proteins associated with antioxidative defense mechanisms [9–12]. MALDI-MS has been successfully applied for characterizing multi protein complexes. Two of the important mass spectrometry “bottom-up” and the less widely used “topdown” methods are the frequently applied. The bottom-up strategy involves enzymatic digestion of intact proteins to generate peptides that are analyzed by the mass spectrometer [13–16]. Research on the stress response has increased greatly, most of its aims at understanding the structure and function of stress proteins. Protein structures are primarily determined by using X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Even though these methods not possible for all proteins, the rate of newly discovered sequences grows much faster than the number of structures solved. The huge gap could possibly be resolved by computational methods. Homology modelling often provides a useful to predict 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure based on protein sequence and aligned to one or more proteins of known structure [17–19]. Functional domain (FD) is the core of a protein that plays the major role in its function. As stated in Mizianty and Kurgan [20] having a wide range of potential applications including predicting protein subcellular location, protein (un) folding rates, DNA binding sites. Little is known about the effect of heavy metals on the protein profile of E. coli strain nissle 1917. Therefore, the objective of this work is to, in combination with 2D electrophoresis, MALDI-MS is in particular applied as downstream analytical methods for protein identification. Protein structure predictions of differentially expressed proteins are formulated under mercury stress by using homology modelling. METHODOLOGY.

Escherichia coli strains nissle 1917, (serotype O6:K5:H1) were obtained from the culture collection of Ardeypharm, GmbH, Herdecke, Germany and was used and cultivated on LB using the streak plate method. The bacterial culture of E. coli nissle 1917 were grown in 5 ml Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L NaCl and 5 g/L yeast extract, pH 7.2) supplemented with 100 mg/L ampicillin at 37°C, 150 RPM for overnight. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of mercury (Hg+2) was determined by macrodilution method. PROTEIN EXTRACTION AND TWO-DIMENSIONAL GEL ELECTROPHORESIS (2DPAGE):. In preparation of protein extraction was performed and Protein content was estimated by Bradford method using Bangalore Genei Kit. For the detection of stress-induced proteins in E.coli nissle 1917, 2D-PAGE was carry out by using IPG strips with pH- ranges of 3-10 and followed second dimension SDS PAGE and the procedure was followed as per Bio-Rad instruction manual. In-gel digestion of the excised gel pieces was performed using sequencing grade trypsin. A basic overview of the methods is presented in (Figure 1). PEPTIDE MASS FINGERPRINTING MALDI-TOF- MS:.

23858467,"Syntaxin1a variants lacking an N-peptide or bearing the LE mutation bind to Munc18a in a closed conformation. In neurons, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins drive the fusion of synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane through the formation of a four-helix SNARE complex. Members of the Sec1/Munc18 protein family regulate membrane fusion through interactions with the syntaxin family of SNARE proteins. The neuronal protein Munc18a interacts with a closed conformation of the SNARE protein syntaxin1a (Syx1a) and with an assembled SNARE complex containing Syx1a in an open conformation. The N-peptide of Syx1a (amino acids 1-24) has been implicated in the transition of Munc18a-bound Syx1a to Munc18a-bound SNARE complex, but the underlying mechanism is not understood. Here we report the X-ray crystal structures of Munc18a bound to Syx1a with and without its native N-peptide (Syx1aΔN), along with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data for Munc18a bound to Syx1a, Syx1aΔN, and Syx1a L165A/E166A (LE), a mutation thought to render Syx1a in a constitutively open conformation. We show that all three complexes adopt the same global structure, in which Munc18a binds a closed conformation of Syx1a. We also identify a possible structural connection between the Syx1a N-peptide and SNARE domain that might be important for the transition of closed-to-open Syx1a in SNARE complex assembly. Although the role of the N-peptide in Munc18a-mediated SNARE complex assembly remains unclear, our results demonstrate that the N-peptide and LE mutation have no effect on the global conformation of the Munc18a-Syx1a complex.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3296,pos_MEDLINE,0.9973218,1

Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are abundantly present in axons and dendrites, and have been shown to play crucial role during the neuronal morphogenesis. The period of main dendritic outgrowth and synaptogenesis coincides with high expression levels of one of MAPs, the MAP2c, in rats. The MAP2c is a 49.2 kDa intrinsically disordered protein. To achieve an atomic resolution characterization of such a large protein, we have developed a protocol based on the acquisition of two five-dimensional (13)C-directly detected NMR experiments.

23878278,"Membrane remodeling by the PX-BAR protein SNX18 promotes autophagosome formation. INTRODUCTION. Autophagy is important for human health and development through protection against neurodegeneration and cancer, removal of invading pathogens, and promotion of life-span extension (Mizushima and Komatsu, 2011). Moreover, autophagy ensures cellular quality control at basal levels and recycles nutrients to permit cellular survival during stresses like starvation (Levine and Kroemer, 2008). Macroautophagy (here referred to as autophagy) is characterized by the sequestration of cytoplasmic material through expansion and closure of a phagophore membrane, forming double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. The autophagosomes mature by fusion with endosomes and finally fuse with lysosomes, where the contents are degraded and the products recycled to the cytosol for reuse. The process of forming an autophagosome requires membrane remodeling and trafficking, and is still poorly understood. The origin of the autophagic membrane is a subject of debate, with the ER, Golgi, mitochondria, plasma membrane, and recycling endosomes as suggested sources (Axe et al., 2008; Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009; Hailey et al., 2010; Ravikumar et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2012; Longatti et al., 2012). It is also unclear how the membrane curvature is generated. More than 30 proteins assisting this process have been described as Autophagy-related (Atg) proteins, which function in a hierarchical order to mediate autophagosome biogenesis (Xie and Klionsky, 2007; Itakura and Mizushima, 2010). Four multiprotein complexes have been found to be required for autophagosome formation, including the Atg1/ULK1 complex, the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex with the associated subunit Atg14L, the Atg9 trafficking system, and finally, the two ubiquitin-like proteins Atg12 and Atg8/LC3 and their conjugation systems. In brief, Atg12 is conjugated to Atg5 through the activity of the Atg7 (E1-like) and Atg10 (E2-like) enzymes, followed by their interaction with membrane-bound Atg16L. Atg8/LC3 becomes conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine in a reaction that requires Atg7 and the E2-like enzyme Atg3, and is facilitated by the Atg5–Atg12–Atg16L1 complex (Hanada et al., 2007). PX domain proteins are known to mediate membrane remodeling and trafficking dependent on phosphoinositide binding (Seet and Hong, 2006). There are 47 human PX domain proteins, including the sorting nexins (SNXs), and many also contain Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs homology (BAR) domains, which are sensors and inducers of membrane curvature (Itoh and De Camilli, 2006). To better understand the phosphoinositide signaling, membrane remodeling, and trafficking events in autophagy, we performed an siRNA screen targeting human PX domain proteins. Depletion of the PX-BAR protein SNX18 strongly inhibited the formation of GFP-LC3–positive autophagosomes, whereas overexpression of SNX18 promoted GFP-LC3 spot formation, dependent on its membrane binding and tubulating ability. SNX18 localizes to structures containing early autophagic markers and interacts with LC3 family members and Atg16L1. We propose a role for SNX18 in promoting LC3 lipidation on tubovesicular structures from recycling endosomes, thereby facilitating membrane delivery to the expanding phagophore. The role of SNX18 in autophagy is conserved, as the Drosophila melanogaster SNX18 homologue SH3PX1 is required for efficient autophagosome formation in larval fat body. RESULTS. SIRNA SCREEN REVEALS SNX18 AS A POSITIVE REGULATOR OF AUTOPHAGY. To uncover a role of PX domain proteins in autophagy, we performed an imaging-based siRNA-screen where HEK cells stably transfected with GFP-LC3 (HEK GFP-LC3; Chan et al., 2007) were transfected with pools of siRNA targeting PX domain proteins, using ULK1 and TSG101 as controls for reduced and increased autophagosome levels, respectively. The cells were starved or not starved before imaging and high-content image analysis where the total intensity (not depicted) and number of GFP-LC3 spots per cell (Fig. 1 A, Table S1, and Fig. S1 A) were quantified as a measure for autophagosome formation. SNX18 was a promising candidate because its silencing strongly inhibited GFP-LC3 spot formation in both fed and starved cells (Fig. 1 A). The candidates that affected GFP-LC3 spot formation the most were further validated in a secondary screen where HEK GFP-LC3 cells were transfected with the four individual siRNA oligonucleotides from the pool used in the primary screen (Fig. 1 B and Table S2). To be selected for further analysis, three out of four individual siRNA oligos had to reproduce the effect from the primary screen and correlate with the level of knockdown, as measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR; Fig. 1 B, spot size correlating to mRNA level). SNX18 and HS1BP3 passed our selection criteria, and in the present study we characterized the role of SNX18 in autophagy. SNX18 IS REQUIRED FOR AUTOPHAGOSOME FORMATION. SNX18 is a member of the SNX9 family of PX-BAR proteins (Håberg et al., 2008). The membrane tubulation activity of these proteins made SNX18 an interesting candidate for a protein involved in autophagosome biogenesis. In line with the decreased number of GFP-LC3 spots seen in the secondary screen (Fig. 1, B and C: Fig. S1; and Table S2), SNX18 depletion also inhibited the conjugation of GFP-LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine, as measured by quantification of lipidated LC3 (LC3-II) versus nonlipidated LC3 (LC3-I; Kabeya et al., 2000), in correlation with the level of SNX18 mRNA and protein knockdown (Fig. 2 A, Fig. S1 C, and Fig. S2 A). In the following experiments we used the best oligo from the pool (siSNX18-3) as well as another (siSNX18-5), which also efficiently depleted SNX18 protein and decreased GFP-LC3-II levels and GFP-LC3 spot formation upon starvation (Figs. 2 A and S2 B). SNX18 depletion did not decrease LC3 mRNA levels (Fig. S1 D).

23911092,"PIF-pocket as a target for C. albicans Pkh selective inhibitors. The phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, PDK1, is a master kinase that phosphorylates the activation loop of up to 23 AGC kinases. S. cerevisiae has three PDK1 orthologues, Pkh1-3, which also phosphorylate AGC kinases (e.g., Ypk, Tpk, Pkc1, and Sch9). Pkh1 and 2 are redundant proteins involved in multiple essential cellular functions, including endocytosis and cell wall integrity. Based on similarities with the budding yeast, the Pkh of fungal infectious species was postulated as a novel target for antifungals. Here, we found that depletion of Pkh eventually induces oxidative stress and DNA double-strand breaks, leading to programmed cell death. This finding supports Pkh as an antifungal target since pharmacological inhibition of Pkh would lead to the death of yeast cells, the ultimate goal of antifungals. It was therefore of interest to further investigate the possibility to develop Pkh inhibitors with selectivity for Candida Pkh that would not inhibit the human ortholog. Here, we describe C. albicans Pkh2 biochemically, structurally and by using chemical probes in comparison to human PDK1. We found that a regulatory site on the C. albicans Pkh2 catalytic domain, the PIF-pocket, diverges from human PDK1. Indeed, we identified and characterized PS77, a new small allosteric inhibitor directed to the PIF-pocket, which has increased selectivity for C. albicans Pkh2.

2391695,"Approaches to isozyme-specific inhibitors. 17. Attachment of a selectivity-inducing substituent to a multisubstrate adduct. Implications for facilitated design of potent, isozyme-selective inhibitors. The synthesis is described of a methyl-C5' adduct of L-methionine and beta,gamma-ATP bearing a 6-S-n-Bu group in place of the 6-NH2 group of the parent adduct. The latter is a potent multisubstrate inhibitor in a model system consisting of the M-2 and M-T isozymes of rat methionine adenosyltransferase. When attached to ATP, the 6-S-n-Bu group induces selectivity for M-T inhibition by elevating affinity for the ATP site of M-T but not of M-2. In the above adduct it exerted a similar effect, expressed by selectivity and increased inhibitory potency toward M-T. This affords a second illustration of the ability of this approach to generate, relatively readily, a potent inhibitor with moderate isozyme selectivity. An overview is given of extensive evidence from the present series of studies that moderate (ca. 10-fold) isozyme selectivity is often exhibited by substrate derivatives bearing a single short substituent at a variety of atoms. This, together with features of another feasible approach to isozyme-selective inhibitor design, suggests an approach that has potential to facilitate the design of potent inhibitors that are both isozyme-selective and selective for a given metabolic conversion. It comprises (1) evaluation of the above type of substrate derivatives as inhibitors of a chemotherapeutically significant set of isozymes (target and nontarget), (2) attempted derivation of a potent multisubstrate adduct inhibitor of the isozymes, (3) attachment to such an adduct of one or more selectivity-inducing substituents revealed in the first step, and, if desired, (4) systematic modification of substituents with a view to obtaining enhanced potency and/or isozyme-selectivity.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3316,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.004297939,0

Binary fission is the ultimate step of the prokaryotic cell cycle. In Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli, this step implies the invagination of three biological layers (cytoplasmic membrane, peptidoglycan and outer membrane), biosynthesis of the new poles and eventually, daughter cells separation. The latter requires the coordinated action of the N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidases AmiA/B/C and their LytM activators EnvC and NlpD to cleave the septal peptidoglycan.

The C-terminal catalytic domain shows an auto-inhibitory alpha helix obstructing the active site. AmiC lacking this helix exhibits by itself an activity comparable to that of the wild type AmiC activated by NlpD.

23972470,"Structural basis for autoactivation of human Mst2 kinase and its regulation by RASSF5. SUMMARY. The tumor-suppressive Hippo pathway controls tissue homeostasis through balancing cell proliferation and apoptosis. Activation of the kinases Mst1/2 is a key upstream event in this pathway and remains poorly understood. Mst1/2 and their critical regulators RASSFs contain SARAH domains that can homo- and hetero-dimerize. Here, we report the crystal structures of human Mst2 alone and bound to RASSF5. Mst2 undergoes activation through trans-autophosphorylation at its activation loop, which requires SARAH-mediated homodimerization. RASSF5 disrupts Mst2 homodimer and blocks Mst2 autoactivation. Binding of RASSF5 to already activated Mst2, however, does not inhibit its kinase activity. Thus, RASSF5 can act as an inhibitor or a potential positive regulator of Mst2, depending on whether it binds to Mst2 before or after activation-loop phosphorylation. We propose that these temporally sensitive functions of RASSFs enable the Hippo pathway to respond to and integrate diverse cellular signals. INTRODUCTION. The Hippo pathway controls organ size and tissue homeostasis through coordinately regulating cell growth, proliferation, and death. This tumor suppressive pathway was first characterized in Drosophila through genetic screens for mutations that caused tissue overgrowth, and was later shown to be conserved in mammals (Badouel et al., 2009; Edgar, 2006; Halder and Johnson, 2011; Harvey and Tapon, 2007; Harvey et al., 2013; Pan, 2010; Staley and Irvine, 2012; Zhao et al., 2010a). The core components of the mammalian Hippo pathway include the Ste20 family kinases Mst1/2, the scaffolding protein Salvador (Sav1), the NDR family kinases Lats1/2, and the adaptor protein Mob1. They form a central kinase cascade to transduce signals from cell-surface receptors (Avruch et al., 2012; Hergovich, 2012). In the canonical Hippo kinase cascade, Mst1/2 in complex with Sav1 phosphorylate and activate the Lats1/2-Mob1 complexes, which then phosphorylate the transcriptional co-activator YAP (Yes-associated protein), a major downstream target of the Hippo pathway (Dong et al., 2007; Hao et al., 2008; Hong and Guan, 2012; Huang et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2007). Lats1/2-mediated phosphorylation inhibits YAP in two ways. Phosphorylation of YAP at S127 by Lats1/2 creates a docking site for 14-3-3 proteins. Binding of 14-3-3 causes the cytoplasmic sequestration and inactivation of YAP (Dong et al., 2007; Hao et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2007). Phosphorylation of YAP at S381 by Lats1/2 promotes its ubiquitination and degradation (Zhao et al., 2010b). When the Hippo pathway is turned off, YAP is dephosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus. Although YAP does not contain a DNA-binding domain, it binds to the TEAD family of transcription factors (which contains a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain) to form a functional hybrid transcription factor (Luo, 2010; Sudol et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2008). The YAP–TEAD hybrid then activates the transcription of Hippo-responsive genes that promote cell growth and proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. Tremendous progress has been made towards the dissection of the molecular circuitry of the Hippo pathway and towards the understanding of the pathophysiology of this pathway in multiple organisms. By contrast, mechanistic and structural studies in this area have lagged behind. In particular, the activation mechanisms of the core Mst1/2-Lats1/2 kinase cascade remain elusive. The upstream kinases Mst1/2 contain an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal SARAH (Salvador/RASSF1A/Hippo) domain (Figure 1A). Mst1 and Mst2 can each form a constitutive homodimer through the SARAH domain, and kinase activation requires autophosphorylation of the activation loop (T183 for Mst1 and T180 for Mst2) (Avruch et al., 2012; Creasy et al., 1996). The Mst1/2 regulators, Sav1 and RASSF proteins, also contain SARAH domains (Figure 1A). The Mst1/2 SARAH domain can form a heterodimer with RASSF SARAH (Hwang et al., 2007) and a heterotetramer with Sav1 SARAH (data not shown). RASSF binding and Sav1 binding to Mst1/2 are mutually exclusive. How RASSFs and Sav1 regulate Mst1/2 activation by forming different SARAH domain-dependent complexes is not understood. RASSFs are important tumor suppressors (Avruch et al., 2009; Richter et al., 2009). Their expression is frequently silenced in human cancers through promoter methylation, and reintroduced expression of RASSF1A or RASSF5 inhibits human tumor cell growth (Aoyama et al., 2004). In addition, RASSF1A knockout mice have increased spontaneous and chemical-induced tumor susceptibility (Tommasi et al., 2005). The roles of RASSFs in the tumor-suppressive Hippo pathway are far from clear, however. In Drosophila, the only RASSF protein (dRASSF) forms a heterodimer with Hippo through SARAH heterodimerization and prevents Salvador from binding to Hippo, thereby inhibiting the Hippo pathway (Polesello et al., 2006).Paradoxically, dRASSF also antagonizes Ras signaling and, in this capacity, has tumor-suppressive function. In mammals, RASSF1, RASSF5, and RASSF6 block Mst1/2 autophosphorylation and activation, possibly through SARAH heterodimerization (Ikeda et al.,2009; Khokhlatchev et al., 2002; Praskova et al., 2004). On the other hand, RASSFs can positively regulate Mst1/2 (Guo et al., 2007; Oh et al., 2006). For example, co-expression of RASSFs with Ras enhances the Mst1 kinase activity. RASSF1A disrupts the interaction between proto-oncogene Raf1 and Mst2, and enhances the Mst2-Lats1 interaction to promote apoptosis through the Hippo pathway (Matallanas et al., 2007). RASSF2 associates with Mst1/2 through its SARAH domain to stabilize and activate Mst1/2 (Cooper et al., 2009; Song et al., 2010).Thus, in both Drosophila and mammals, RASSFs appear to have both negative and positive regulatory functions in the Hippo pathway. Here, we report the crystal structures of the human Mst2 kinase domain and Mst2 in complex with the SARAH domain of RASSF5. SARAH-mediated",PMC,pos,1,pos,3328,pos_PMC,0.99789256,1

Cucumber Necrosis Virus (CNV) is a member of the genus Tombusvirus and has a monopartite positive-sense RNA genome packaged in a T=3 icosahedral particle. CNV is transmitted in nature via zoospores of the fungus Olpidium bornovanus. CNV undergoes a conformational change upon binding to the zoospore that is required for transmission, and specific polysaccharides on the zoospore surface have been implicated in binding. To better understand this transmission process, we have determined the atomic structure of CNV. As expected, being a member of the Tombusvirus genus, the core structure of CNV is highly similar to that of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), with major differences lying on the exposed loops. Also, as was seen with TBSV, CNV appears to have a calcium binding site between the subunits around the quasi-3-fold axes. However, unlike TBSV, there appears to be a novel zinc binding site within the β annulus formed by the N termini of the three C subunits at the icosahedral 3-fold axes.

24038467,"A transient α-helical molecular recognition element in the disordered N-terminus of the Sgs1 helicase is critical for chromosome stability and binding of Top3/Rmi1. INTRODUCTION. The maintenance of genome stability is essential for organismal survival. A complex and diverse system of proteins has evolved to accomplish this function. Sgs1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a 3–5′ DNA helicase that belongs to the evolutionarily conserved RecQ helicase family whose members function in the maintenance of genome stability. Named after the RecQ helicase of Escherichia coli, members of this helicase family have been identified in all organisms, including five homologs in humans (RecQ1, BLM, WRN, RecQL4, RecQL5) (1). Mutations in BLM, WRN and RecQL4 are associated with Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome and Rothmund–Thompson syndrome, respectively, which are characterized by elevated levels of aberrant recombination events, chromosome instability and extraordinary predisposition to cancer development early in life (1). Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells that lack Sgs1 exhibit several phenotypes that are similar to those of cells from persons with Bloom syndrome, most notably dysregulated homologous recombination, hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, meiotic defects and cell cycle delay (2,3). These defects are caused when the helicase activity of Sgs1 is inactivated by mutations in the ATPase domain or the RecQ C-terminal domain, which together make up the helicase core. Also located in the C-terminal half of Sgs1 is the Helicase and RNAase D C-terminal (HRDC) domain thought to be involved in DNA substrate binding and protein–protein interactions. These domains are conserved in most RecQ homologs; they are structurally ordered and crystal structures of this region have been reported for E. coli RecQ and human RecQ1 (4,5). In contrast, the N-terminal half of Sgs1 is devoid of conserved catalytic domains and provides binding sites for proteins with roles in DNA metabolism, including the topoisomerases Top2 and Top3, replication protein Rpa70, Rad16 and Srs2 (2,6–8). Interaction with the Top3 homologs has also been shown for human BLM, RecQ1 and RecQ5, and the RecQ homolog of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Rqh1 (9–12). Superhelical relaxation activity and Holliday-junction dissolution activity of these topoisomerase/helicase complexes is greatly enhanced by interaction with the RecQ-mediated genome instability 1 (Rmi1) protein (13–15). One of the most important functions of the Sgs1 N-terminus is the interaction with the Top3/Rmi1 complex (BLM/Topo IIIα/Rmi1/Rmi2 in humans, Rqh1/Top3/Rmi1 in S. pombe) (13–16). The Top3 binding site is within the first 100–158 residues of Sgs1 (17–19). The loss of this region produces more severe phenotypes that exhibit slower growth and higher sensitivity to DNA damage than those produced by loss of Sgs1 alone (3). This may be due to toxic intermediates produced by Sgs1 that accumulate during homologous recombination and require Top3 decatenation for resolution. Despite the fact that Sgs1 and BLM bind Top3 and its human homolog Topo IIIα, respectively, there is little primary sequence similarity between the N-terminal regions where these interactions are predicted to occur. Both N-termini are predicted to be intrinsically disordered (20), which may help explain their level of sequence divergence (21,22). Such intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) are widespread in eukaryotes and function arises from an ensemble of conformations that contain varying degrees of secondary structure and rarely form transient tertiary contacts (21,23–28). A high percentage of eukaryotic proteins are predicted to contain significant stretches (>30 residues) of disorder; in S. cerevisiae, 50–60% of the total proteome are IDPs/IDRs, and a survey of cancer-associated human proteins found that ∼79% of the proteins in the database are IDPs/IDRs (29,30). Using multidimensional heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we have identified a short segment within the first 125 residues of the intrinsically disordered N-terminus of unbound Sgs1 that has transient α-helical structure whose integrity is essential for Sgs1 function in vivo. We have rationally designed single amino acid substitutions that disrupt transient α-helices. Some of these mutations eliminate Top3 binding to Sgs1, cause DNA damage hypersensitivity and induce spontaneous chromosomal rearrangements. MATERIALS AND METHODS.

24063750,"Ataxin-3 is a multivalent ligand for the parkin Ubl domain. Protein degradation is a tightly orchestrated process that is required to maintain cell homeostasis. When homeostasis is not maintained, disease-prone events such as protein misfolding and aggregation can frequently occur, the hallmarks of several disorders, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases. The ubiquitination proteolysis pathway is the primary mechanism for directing proteins to the proteasomal degradation machinery, eliminating unwanted proteins and preserving protein levels in the cell. A cascade of three proteins, ubiquitin-activating (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating (E2), and ubiquitin-ligase (E3) enzymes, are utilized for covalently attaching the small protein ubiquitin to a substrate and building a polyubiquitin chain required for recognition by the proteasome. Of the three classes of proteins involved in ubiquitination, the E3 ubiquitin ligase proteins have been especially attractive targets for drug discovery because more than 1000 different homologues have been identified, suggesting that the E3 protein is a major contributor to the substrate specificity in the pathway. Parkin is a RING-inBetweenRING-RING (RBR) E3 ligase composed of 465 residues with multiple domains, including N-terminal Ubl (ubiquitin-like), UPD (unique-parkin domain), RING0, RING1, IBR (inBetweenRING), and RING2 domains. Specific mutations in the PARK2 gene, encoding parkin, have been linked to an autosomal recessive inheritance of Parkinson’s disease (PD). This form of PD afflicts approximately 5–10% of PD patients and is distinguished by an early onset age, typically earlier than 40 years old, but otherwise has many of the characteristics of the more common idiopathic form. One hypothesis for the function of parkin is that it regulates appropriate levels of its protein substrates, avoiding accumulations of aggregate-prone substrates such as α-synuclein, Aβ peptide, and Huntingtin protein. Other substrates have also been proposed for parkin such as synphillin-1, Pael-R, and cyclin E, although confirmation of these has not been resolved. One mechanism for recruitment of substrates by parkin is through its Ubl domain. Recent evidence shows that in addition to possible substrate recognition, the Ubl domain modulates the activity of parkin through interaction with the RBR region. Like ubiquitin, the Ubl domain has a β-grasp fold with an exposed domain hydrophobic face comprised of five β-sheets. The parkin Ubl domain has been previously shown to interact with proteins containing a short recognition motif termed a ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) found in proteasomal subunit S5a, the endocytosis protein Eps15, and ataxin-3, a deubiquitinating enzyme. The UIM region is composed of ∼20 residues and contains a conserved acidic stretch located prior to a five-residue (large–small–large–small–large side chain size) core motif, followed by a conserved serine residue. The multistep enzymatic reaction for the attachment of ubiquitin to a substrate protein can be reversed by ubiquitin specific proteases or deubiquitinating enzymes. This removal of ubiquitin from a substrate is thought to correct errors in the ubiquitin chain building process by ensuring the correct substrate, linkage, and chain length. This allows deubiquitinating enzymes to work with an E3 enzyme to edit substrate ubiquitination and adapt to constantly changing cellular environments. Ataxin-3 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that has a preference for editing K63-linked ubiquitin chains and plays a role in DNA repair and ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation). The deubiquitinating activity of ataxin-3 is controlled through its N-terminal Josephin domain that houses the catalytic site for activity. The C-terminus of ataxin-3 contains three UIM regions (UIM1–UIM3) thought to control the interaction with potential substrate proteins such as parkin, VCP (valosin-containing protein), and E6-AP (ubiquitin ligase E3A). The second and third UIM regions in ataxin-3 are separated by a variable glutamine tract that contributes to one of nine identified polyglutamine diseases causing Machado Joseph disease when the polyglutamine stretch exceeds a threshold of 45 residues. In this work, we identified the mechanism of interaction between the C-terminus of ataxin-3 and the Ubl domain of parkin. Our work presents evidence that all three UIM regions of ataxin-3 have direct weak interactions with the hydrophobic patch of the parkin Ubl domain consistent with a multivalent ligand binding mechanism. These observations provide a better understanding of the recognition of the UIM regions of ataxin-3 by parkin that contributes to an understanding of its role in deubiquitination activity. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES. MOLECULAR BIOLOGY. The DNA encoding the human parkin ubiquitin-like domain (residues 1–77) was inserted into the NdeI and BamHI sites of a pET44a vector (Novagen) as previously described. Parkin Ubl domain constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Robarts Sequencing Facility). The cDNAs encoding full-length human ataxin-3 proteins with a 14- or 82-residue polyglutamine tract were provided by E. Fon (McGill University, Montreal, QC). A fragment containing all three UIM sequences from ataxin-3 (residues 194–361, UIM_123) was generated by inserting the corresponding sequence into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pET21a vector (Novagen) that included an in-frame six-residue histidine tag. A similar approach was used for site-directed mutagenesis to incorporate a TEV cleavage site to allow for removal of the histidine tag from all ataxin-3 constructs. A C-terminal deletion construct, consisting of UIM1 and UIM2 (residues 194–261, UIM_12Δ3), was generated by encoding a stop site prior to the polyglutamine stretch. An N-terminal construct containing UIM1 (UIM_1Δ23) was generated in a similar fashion by placing a stop codon prior to the DNA sequence encoding UIM2.

24065769,"Mechanistic insights into CED-4-mediated activation of CED-3. Many concepts of programmed cell death (PCD), also known as apoptosis, were derived from genetic investigation of cell deaths in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Horvitz et al. 1994). Initiation of PCD in C. elegans is controlled by four genes—ced-3, ced-4, ced-9, and egl-1—that act in a linear pathway (Fig. 1A; Horvitz 2003). The cell-killing protease CED-3 belongs to the caspase family (Yuan et al. 1993; Xue et al. 1996) and is synthesized as an inactive zymogen in cells. Activation of CED-3 occurs in three sequential steps (Fig. 1B). First, in response to cell death stimuli, the proapoptotic, BH3-only protein EGL-1 is activated and negatively regulates the anti-apoptotic protein CED-9 through direct interaction (Conradt and Horvitz 1998; del Peso et al. 1998, 2000; Parrish et al. 2000). Second, binding of EGL-1 to CED-9 leads to allosteric disruption of the interactions between CED-9 and CED-4, resulting in the release of CED-4 from the inhibitory CED-9–CED-4 complex (Hengartner and Horvitz 1994; Chinnaiyan et al. 1997; James et al. 1997; Spector et al. 1997; Wu et al. 1997; Chen et al. 2000). Third and finally, the released proapoptotic protein CED-4 facilitates autocataltytic activation of the CED-3 zymogen (Yuan and Horvitz 1992; Chinnaiyan et al. 1997; Irmler et al. 1997; Seshagiri and Miller 1997; Wu et al. 1997; Yang et al. 1998). Elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which CED-3, CED-4, CED-9, and EGL-1 control the onset of PCD is central to understanding the regulation of PCD. Rigorous investigations in the past decade have revealed mechanistic insights into the first two steps of the linear PCD pathway in C. elegans (Fig. 1B). First, EGL-1 uses an extended BH3 helix to recognize a hydrophobic groove on the surface of CED-9 (Yan et al. 2004). Second, binding of EGL-1 to CED-9 induces pronounced conformational changes in CED-9, which, through allostery, destabilize the interactions between CED-9 and CED-4, ultimately leading to the dissociation of CED-9 from an asymmetric dimer of CED-4 (Yan et al. 2005; Yan et al. 2006b). The freed CED-4 dimer further oligomerizes to form the CED-4 apoptosome, which is responsible for the activation of CED-3. In sharp contrast to the mechanistic elucidation of the first two steps in the linear PCD pathway, the third and arguably most important step—how CED-4 mediates the activation of CED-3—remains largely enigmatic. At present, there is little information on how the CED-4 apoptosome specifically recognizes the CED-3 zymogen. There is no experimental identification of any specific sequence or structural motifs that are responsible for the interactions between CED-4 and CED-3. The unorthodox experimental revelation that the octameric CED-4 apoptosome only binds two molecules of CED-3 has engendered much excitement as well as doubt in the field, both of which ask for mechanistic explanation. In this study, we address these questions by deciphering a central piece of the puzzle: how CED-3 is specifically recognized by CED-4. The crystal structure unambiguously shows that CED-3 is bound within the hutch of the funnel-shaped CED-4 apoptosome, whereas our structural analysis indicates that only two CED-3 molecules can be accommodated within the hutch. These structural findings have important ramifications for understanding initiator caspase activation. RESULTS. STRUCTURE OF PROCESSED CED-3. Despite the advent of the structural information on a number of caspases, CED-3 remains structurally uncharacterized. To gain insights into CED-3 activation, we crystallized the two-chain caspase domain of CED-3 (residues 198–374, 389–503, and C358S) and determined its structure at 2.65 Å resolution (Fig. 1C; Supplemental Table S1). Mutation of the catalytic residue Cys358 to Ser was essential for the generation of a stable CED-3 for crystallization. Although CED-3 exists mainly as a monomer in solution (Qi et al. 2010), it was crystallized as an asymmetric homodimer in the crystals, likely due to the high protein concentrations required for crystallization. As anticipated, the overall structure is very similar to that of other caspases. Notably, the two molecules of CED-3 exhibit contrasting features at the active site. The active site in one CED-3 molecule exists in a productive conformation, with loops L2 and L4 interacting with the L2′ loop of the adjacent molecule to form a loop bundle that is characteristic of activated caspases (Fig. 1C; Supplemental Fig. S1A). In contrast, the active site in the adjacent CED-3 molecule does not have a well-defined conformation, with the L2 loop largely disordered in the crystals. Asymmetric features of the active site have been previously observed in other initiator caspases, such as caspase-9 (Renatus et al. 2001) and Dronc (Yan et al. 2006a). This structural feature might be physiologically important; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that this feature is a consequence of crystal-packing interactions because the disordered active site is in close contact with another CED-3 molecule in the crystal lattice. REQUIREMENT OF THE L2′ LOOP FOR CED-3 ASSOCIATION WITH CED-4. The structural information of CED-3 empowered us to identify the surface elements that are responsible for binding to the CED-4 apoptosome. Guided by the structure, we carefully designed 21 CED-3 mutants, each containing one or more missense mutations on surface-exposed amino acids (Supplemental Fig. S1B). These targeted amino acids cover ∼50% of the exposed surface area on CED-3 and include most polar, charged, or long chain hydrophobic amino acids on the surface. Ten CED-3 mutant proteins exhibited poor solubility and were unfit for biochemical characterization; the rest were purified to homogeneity and assayed for their ability to interact with CED-4. Surprisingly, none of the remaining 11 CED-3 mutants lost the ability to associate with the CED-4 apoptosome (Supplemental Fig. S1B). This result suggests that the primary CED-4-interacting e",PMC,pos,1,pos,3352,pos_PMC,0.9273633,1
24068428,"Mycoplasma hyorhinis-encoded purine nucleoside phosphorylase: kinetic properties and its effect on the cytostatic potential of purine-based anticancer drugs. A mycoplasma-encoded purine nucleoside phosphorylase (designated PNPHyor) has been cloned and characterized for the first time. Efficient phosphorolysis of natural 6-oxopurine and 6-aminopurine nucleosides was observed, with adenosine the preferred natural substrate (Km = 61 µM). Several cytostatic purine nucleoside analogs proved to be susceptible to PNPHyor-mediated phosphorolysis, and a markedly decreased or increased cytostatic activity was observed in Mycoplasma hyorhinis-infected human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cell cultures (MCF-7.Hyor), depending on the properties of the released purine base. We demonstrated an ∼10-fold loss of cytostatic activity of cladribine in MCF-7.Hyor cells and observed a rapid and complete phosphorolysis of this drug when it was exposed to the supernatant of mycoplasma-infected cells. This conversion (inactivation) could be prevented by a specific PNP inhibitor. These findings correlated well with the high efficiency of PNPHyor-catalyzed phosphorolysis of cladribine to its less toxic base 2-chloroadenine (Km = 80 µM). In contrast, the cytostatic activity of nucleoside analogs carrying a highly toxic purine base and being a substrate for PNPHyor, but not human PNP, was substantially increased in MCF-7.Hyor cells (∼130-fold for fludarabine and ∼45-fold for 6-methylpurine-2'-deoxyriboside). Elimination of the mycoplasma from the tumor cell cultures or selective inhibition of PNPHyor by a PNP inhibitor restored the cytostatic activity of the purine-based nucleoside drugs. Since several studies suggest a high and preferential colonization or association of tumor tissue in cancer patients with different prokaryotes (including mycoplasmas), the data presented here may be of relevance for the optimization of purine nucleoside-based anticancer drug treatment.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3353,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.47431618,0
24081582,"Crystal structure of tRNA m1G9 methyltransferase Trm10: insight into the catalytic mechanism and recognition of tRNA substrate. INTRODUCTION. Transfer RNA (tRNA), which is typically 73–94 nt in length, serves as the carrier of activated amino acids to the ribosome for the biological synthesis of proteins (translation). The specific nucleotide sequence of an mRNA specifies the amino acids that are incorporated into the protein product of the gene from which the mRNA is transcribed, and the role of tRNA is to specify the corresponding amino acid from the genetic code. Therefore, tRNA plays an indispensable role in the process of protein translation. During tRNA maturation, extensive specific posttranscriptional modifications are introduced by many different enzymes to ensure proper tRNA structure and function (1,2). To date, over 100 different chemical modifications in tRNA from the three domains of life have been identified (3). Based on their affects on tRNA functions, posttranscriptional modifications can be generally divided into two groups: some modifications are thought to stabilize the 3D structure of tRNAs and are extremely important for in vivo stability, while others that are present within or in proximity to anticodon are well known to affect the efficiency or fidelity of translation (4–6). A common tRNA modification is the methylation of ribonucleosides, including the N1 methylation of guanine (m1G). However, thus far, only a few m1G modifications have been identified in tRNA. The m1G37 modification, which is present at Position 37 (adjacent to 3′ of the anticodon) of the tRNA, is found to be essential in maintaining the reading frame fidelity (7). This modification is catalyzed by TrmD in bacteria and Trm5 in archaea and eukaryotes (8,9). Another modification is the m1G9 modification, which occurs at the junction of the D and acceptor stems. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this modification was identified in 10 tRNA species out of 34 sequenced tRNAs and was reported to be catalyzed by Trm10 (10). The Trm10 gene knockout strain of S. cerevisiae exhibited elevated sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) compared with the wild-type strain (11), indicating that loss of the m1G9 modification might result in the destabilization of tRNAs and growth defects of the strain. Additionally, another study provided genetic evidence supporting an important role for the m1G9 modification in translation termination efficiency (12). Moreover, Position 9 (G or A) of human tRNA was methylated by Trm10 homolog (13). Helm et al. reported that the in vitro transcript of human (mt)tRNALys that was deprived of the m1A9 modification did not fold into a cloverleaf, suggesting that the presence of a methyl group at A9 would prevent the Watson–Crick interaction A9–U64 and consequently hinder the formation of the extended amino acid-accepting stem (14). RNA methyltransferases (MTases) often use the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor to catalyze the methyl group transfer to various positions of the nucleotide bases, resulting in the formation of methylated RNA and S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) as products (15). Thus far, all known RNA MTases can be classified into at least four unrelated superfamilies, including Rossmann-fold (RFM), SpoU-TrmD (SPOUT), radical-SAM and FAD/NAD(P)-dependent MTases (16,17). Most of the known MTases belong to the RFM family, which frequently exist as monomers (16). The SPOUT family includes SpoU and TrmD MTases and represents the second largest RNA MTase family. One structural characteristic of SPOUT MTases is that they form tightly bound homodimers that are mediated by the interaction between their MTase domains. An additional feature is the presence of a trefoil knot at the C-terminus of the MTase domain that is responsible for SAM binding (18,19). Trm10 homologs are widely found in eukaryotes and archaea but not in eubacteria. Orthologs of Trm10 in archaea act at Position 9 of tRNA and catalyze both m1A and m1G formation (20). In vertebrates such as Homo sapiens, three Trm10 isoforms have been identified: TrmT10A, TrmT10B and TrmT10C. The human homologs TrmT10A and TrmT10B demonstrate tRNA m1G MTase activity at Position 9. TrmT10C was first identified as one subunit (MRPP1) of the human mitochondrial (mt)RNase P complex that is necessary to process tRNA precursors and even the maturation of human mitochondrial (21). However, TrmT10C requires another protein, SDR5C1 (MRPP2), to execute its m1R9 (G9 and A9) MTase and additional RNase P activity (13). There is no identifiable sequence homology between the Trm10 family and previously characterized MTases, including m1G MTases, such as Trm5 and TrmD. Thus far, there is no available structural information for the Trm10 family, although a bioinformatics study predicted that Trm10 may be a member of the SPOUT superfamily (19). Knowledge of the 3D structure of Trm10 family MTases would aid in the understanding of the tRNA substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism of Trm10 for tRNA modification. Here, we report the crystal structures of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe tRNA m1G9 MTase Trm10 in the presence and absence of SAH in addition to the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Trm10 in complex with SAH, which represent the first crystal structures of the Trm10 family. Using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we further demonstrate that Trm10 functions as a monomer in solution. In vitro tRNA MTases assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) provide a better understanding of the structure–function relationship of the Trm10 family. MATERIALS AND METHODS.

24116191,"Structural and functional analyses of DNA-sensing and immune activation by human cGAS. INTRODUCTION. In the innate immune system, germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize both non-self products, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and self products, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), to activate signaling pathways resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines or type I interferons (IFNs) [1]. Cytosolic DNAs, derived from invading pathogens and host genomes, are strong activators of the innate immune system as PAMPs and DAMPs, respectively [2]. So far, several types of PRRs have been reported as cytosolic DNA sensors [3-12]. Recent studies have shown that stimulator of interferon genes, STING (also named MPYS, MITA, or ERIS), plays a central role in the signaling cascades of cytosolic DNA sensing [13,14]. The activation of STING by cytosolic DNA triggers the TBK1-IRF3 pathway, to induce the expression of IFNs, as well as the NF-κB transcription pathway, to produce cytokines [15]. Although pathogenic cytosolic DNA activates STING-dependent pathways, STING itself binds to DNA with very low affinity in vitro, suggesting the requirement of another PRR for DNA sensing [16]. Recent studies identified cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) as a cytosolic DNA PRR, and its product, cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), binds to STING as a second messenger, resulting in the activation of the STING-dependent IRF3 pathway [17,18]. Quite recently, three groups have solved the crystal structures of mouse cGAS alone and in complex with DNA/nucleotides, porcine cGAS alone and in complex with DNA/nucleotides, and human cGAS alone, respectively [19-21]. Together, these results indicated that upon DNA binding, a conformational change occurs that is essential for cGAMP production. Here, we report the structure of human cGAS in a novel crystal form. On the basis of structural comparisons with the mouse and porcine cGAS structures and functional analyses, we discuss the importance of the common structural features, along with the relevance of DNA detection, for the STING-dependent immune activation. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PROTEIN PREPARATION AND CRYSTALLIZATION. The gene encoding human cGAS (residues 161-522) was inserted into a modified pE-SUMO Vector (LifeSensors), with insertion of the sequence cleaved by TEV protease between the N-terminal SUMO tag and the multicloning site. The protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta2 (DE3) (Novagen), and purified by chromatography on Ni-NTA (Qiagen), HiTrap Heparin and Superdex 200 gel filtration columns (GE Healthcare). The cGAS mutants were prepared by a PCR-based method, and the sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. The mutants were purified according to a protocol similar to that used for wild type cGAS. Crystallization was performed at 20°C by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals were obtained in a buffer consisting of 18% PEG3350, 0.2 M ammonium nitrate, 0.5 M NaCl, and 0.02 mM CYMAL-7. DATA COLLECTION, STRUCTURE DETERMINATION, AND REFINEMENT. Crystals were cryoprotected in the crystallization buffer supplemented with 30% glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were collected on beamline BL41XU at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan), using an MX225HE detector. Data were processed and scaled with the HKL2000 program package (HKL Research Inc.). The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method with the MOLREP program [22], using the complex structure of mouse cGAS with DNA (PDB ID 4K96) [19] as the search model. Model building and refinement were performed using COOT [23] and PHENIX [24], respectively. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession code 4MKP. DNA-BINDING EXPERIMENT. The cGAS wild type and mutant proteins were mixed with biotinylated ISD (Interferon stimulatory DNA, Sense strand sequence 5′-TACAGATCTACTAGTGATCTATGACTGATCTGTACATGATCTACA-3′) at room temperature for 1 hour. They were then mixed with Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (Life Technologies) in buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% NP-40) for 1 hour. The beads were washed three times with the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. ANTIBODIES, REAGENTS, CELL CULTURE, TRANSFECTION AND IMMUNOBLOTTING. Anti-STING (#3337), anti-phospho-TBK1 (#5483), anti-TBK1 (#3504), anti-phospho-IRF3 (#4947), and anti-IRF3 (#11904) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-HOIP (SAB2102031), anti-HOIL-1L (NBP1-88301), anti-TRAF2 (558890), and anti-TRAF6 (H-274) antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Novus, BD Pharmingen, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Other antibodies and reagents were obtained as described previously [25]. HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU ml−1 penicillin G and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-STING-FLAG-His6 and pXS-Puro, and puromycin-resistant stable clones expressing human STING (293T-STING cells) were selected. SDS-PAGE and western blotting were performed as described previously [25]. LUCIFERASE REPORTER ASSAY. The pGL3-IFNβ-promoter-Luc plasmid was kindly provided by Prof. O.

Statins exert anti-inflammatory characteristics, besides their lipid lowering properties, and may display beneficial effects for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. One possible explanation is that statins interfere in the deregulated gene transcription patterns associated with immune-mediated diseases, although the precise mechanism is not fully understood. Besides gene regulatory proteins, epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in the orchestration of gene expression. Disturbances in the tightly controlled epigenetic mechanisms influence the cellular portrait of expressed genes resulting in the protein dysfunctions found in many inflammatory diseases. In this study, we found that simvastatin reduces secretion and gene expression of CCL2 in monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells and in type 1 macrophages, which is accompanied by increased levels of the 3meK27H3 and 3meK9H3 repressive histone marks and decreased levels of the permissive histone marks AcH3 and 3meK4H3 in CCL2 promoter chromatin.

In this article, we examine the activation-degradation role of the acidic TAD of EKLF and demonstrate that the first 40 residues (EKLFTAD1) within this region form a noncovalent interaction with UBI. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structural studies of an EKLFTAD1-UBI complex show that EKLFTAD1 adopts a 14-residue α helix that forms the recognition interface with UBI in a similar manner as the UBI-interacting helix of Rabex5. We also identify a similar interaction between UBI and the activation-degradation region of SREBP1a, but not with the activation-degradation regions of p53, GAL4, and VP16. These results suggest that select activation-degradation regions like the ones found in EKLF and SREBP1a function in part through their ability to form noncovalent interactions with UBI.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3378,pos_MEDLINE,0.998103,1
24145868,"Functional role of the flexible N-terminal extension of FKBP38 in catalysis. Apoptosis is an essential process in multi-cellular organisms during development and homeostasis12, and its dysregulation contributes to the development of various pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases3. The family of Bcl-2 proteins plays key regulatory roles in the apoptotic cell death pathway14. As a gatekeeper of apoptosis, Bcl-2 maintains the membrane integrity of subcellular organelles, particularly of the mitochondria. Upregulation or stabilization of Bcl-2 has been associated with cancer; downregulation or destabilization of Bcl-2 with ischemia/neurodegeneration. FK506 binding protein 38 (FKBP38) is a multi-domain protein containing a peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) domain followed by three consecutive tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), a calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain, and a transmembrane domain (Fig. 1)567. It has been shown that FKBP38 forms a complex with Bcl-2589. However, the molecular basis of this interaction is unclear. In addition, the biological consequences of the FKBP38-Bcl-2 interaction are poorly understood. Although FKBP38 appears anti-apoptotic in some cell lines, via stabilizing Bcl-2 through co-localization and protection from degradation510, in other studies, the interaction disrupts Bcl-2 activity and therefore is pro-apoptotic811. These pro-apoptotic effects of nuclear Bcl-2 are suppressed with increasing FKBP38 levels12. In addition, a viral homolog of Bcl-2 in Hepatitis C (NS5A) appears to use FKBP38 for its anti-apoptotic effects in hepatoma cells13. An important variable rarely defined in these studies is the level of calcium-saturated calmodulin (CaM/Ca2+) in the experimental system, which significantly enhances the interaction between Bcl-2 and FKBP38 by an undetermined mechanism presumed to include the putative calmodulin binding domain identified at the C-terminus811. To better understand the conflicting evidence from in vivo and in vitro systems, it is necessary to understand the interactions between FKBP38 and its binding partners on a molecular level. In an effort to understand the molecular basis of FKBP38-Bcl-2 interaction, we first measured the isomerase activity of the FK506 binding domain of FKBP38 (FKBD38) and found that it was catalytically competent in the absence of CaM/Ca2+. Surprisingly, we found that the N-terminal extension, a region on the amino terminal side of the isomerase domain, autoinhibits isomerase activity and that this effect was reversed by CaM/Ca2+. We determined the solution structure of the N-terminal domain of FKBP38 (NTD), comprising the N-terminal extension and the core isomerase domain FKBD38, and mapped molecular interactions involving the N-terminal extension, NTD, FKBD38 and CaM/Ca2+. Conformational dyanmics was studied by NMR relaxation measurements revealing an increased mobility of the N-terminal extension comparing with the isomerase domain of the NTD. We proposed an activation mechanism for the isomerase activity of FKBP38 that involves a second calmodulin binding site in the N-terminal extension, providing a molecular rationale for the FKBP38/Bcl-2 regulation. RESULTS. REGULATION OF CATALYTIC ACTIVITY. It was previously suggested that the binding of CaM/Ca2+ to FKBP38 activates the PPIase activity of FKBP38 and subsequently allows Bcl-2 to bind to the complex8, but it was unclear how calmodulin activates this noncanonical activity of FKBP38 and facilitates protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions. FKBD38, the core isomerase domain of FKBP38, is flanked by a 32-residue N-terminal extension and C-terminal TPR, a putative calmodulin-binding site, and a transmembrane region (Fig. 1). To determine the contributions of the N- and C-terminal extensions on the isomerase activity and to uncover the mechanism by which CaM/Ca2+ activates FKBP38, we constructed three FKBP38 fragments and compared their activities in the presence and absence of CaM/Ca2+. As seen in Table 1, consistent with a previous study8, the isomerase activity of the full-length FKBP38 was activated by the addition of CaM/Ca2+. Interestingly, the FKBD38 showed similar levels of PPIase activity in the absence of CaM/Ca2+, suggesting that either the N- or C-terminal extensions were inhibitory and responsive to CaM/Ca2+. We then identified that NTD, a fragment of FKBP38, containing the N-terminal extension, but lacking the C-terminal extension, was activated by the addition of CaM/Ca2+ (Table 1). Taken together, the data suggest that the core isomerase activity of FKBP38 is inhibited by the N-terminal extension residues flanking the isomerase domain, and that this inhibition is overcome by the addition of CaM/Ca2+. CONFORMATIONAL FLEXIBILITY OF FKBP38 NTD. To investigate the role of the N-terminal extension residues, we measured backbone 15N relaxation rates and {1H}-15N heteronuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) for the FKBD38 and NTD in the presence and absence of CaM/Ca2+. The values of the relaxation parameters are shown in Figs. 2a,b, Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b. The average values of T1 for residues with a heteronuclear NOE > 0.6 and no internal motions measured for the NTD are 862.03 ms in the free state and 872.92 ms when bound to CaM/Ca2+. The average T2 values for the NTD in the absence and presence of CaM/Ca2+ are 71.94 and 70.42 ms, respectively. The tumbling correlation times τc derived from the trimmed mean 15N T1/T2 ratio1415 for FKBD38, NTD and NTD/CaM/Ca2+ are 7.29, 9.07, and 9.24 ns, respectively (Table 2). While the values observed for FKBD38 and the free NTD are consistent with the molecular weight expected for the monomeric proteins, the increase in the tumbling correlation time upon binding of CaM/Ca2+ is surprisingly small. This suggests that no specific tight complex is formed and that the interaction with CaM/Ca2+ is weak and transient. Comparable low heteronuclear NOE values are observed for residues 1–32 in the N-terminal extension for both the free and CaM",PMC,pos,1,pos,3379,pos_PMC,0.9946464,1

24223817,"Metagenomic insights into the carbohydrate-active enzymes carried by the microorganisms adhering to solid digesta in the rumen of cows. INTRODUCTION. The rumen microbiome is among the most rapid and efficient in degrading cellulose and hemicellulose. Even so, up to half of the ingested cellulosic material can pass the rumen undigested due to both its inherent recalcitrance and the short retention time in the rumen [1]. Hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass to monomeric sugars is also the bottleneck step to producing cellulosic biofuel [2]. Therefore, the rumen microbiome has attracted enormous interest in the pursuit of improved feed utilization efficiency of the livestock industry and cost-competitive production of cellulosic biofuel [3]–[7]. Because most of the glycoside hydrolysis occurs in the biofilm adhering to the ingested feed particles [8], most metagenomic studies focused on the bacterial community adherent to the fiber particles [3]–[6]. To date several large metagenomic studies have reported the diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) from the rumen microbiome of Angus beef cattle [4], Guernsey dairy cattle [3], reindeer [5], and yak [7]. Pope et al [9] also reported new CAZymes and polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL)-like systems that contain genes encoding β-1,4-endoglucanases and β-1,4-endoxylanases in the foregut microbiome of tammar wallaby native to South and Western Australia. However, the CAZyme diversity in the rumen of dairy cattle has not been explored extensively even though Hess et al. [3] has investigated the CAZymes of bacteria adhering to switchgrass (a bioenergy crop placed in nylon bags) in the rumen of two Guernsey dairy cows. Studies on phylogenetic diversity and community structure based on 16S rRNA genes have documented that the rumen microbiome can be shaped by both diet and host genetics. The effects of host genetics on the rumen microbiome were demonstrated by some unique features of the rumen microbiome of African ruminant species [10], reindeer [11], yak [12], buffalo [13], and comparative studies among different species [14], while dietary effects were revealed by the shifts of microbial populations upon changes in diets [15], [16]. Although the diversity of CAZy genes in the rumen of Angus, Guernsey, buffalo, reindeer, and yak have been explored, no study has been reported for Jersey cattle, one of the major dairy cattle breeds in the US and other countries. The objectives of this study were to explore the diversity of CAZy genes in the rumen of Jersey cattle and to compare it with that of the CAZy genes found in the rumen of other species or breeds. Instead of shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which generates large numbers of gene fragments that can lead to diversity overestimate and incorrect annotation, we focused on sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of 120 fosmid clones that expressed hydrolase activities towards polysaccharides (cellulose and xylan). New putative CAZy genes of full length were found and some features of gene organization suggest synchronized polysaccharide utilization with other metabolism. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. Metagenomics has been used to explore the diversity of CAZymes in the rumen or gut of herbivore animals. This is, however, the first metagenomic study that used an activity-based fosmid library in examining the CAZymes diversity of the biofilm colonizing feed particles, where fiber digestion takes place [8], in the rumen of Jersey cows. From screening 14,000 fosmid clones (30 – 40 kb insert per clone, corresponding to 0.42 – 0.56 Gb of rumen metagenomic DNA in total), 120 clones were found hydrolase-active toward cellulose (34 clones), xylan (52 clones), starch (1 clone), and esculin hydrate (33 clones). These fosmid clones were pyrosequenced as a pool, yielding > 600,000 high-quality reads with an average length of 455 bp (about 280 Mb DNA sequences in total), which represent an average sequencing coverage of 58× for the sequenced fosmids. A two-staged integrated sequence assembly approach using multiple software tools (see Materials and Methods) generated 66 contigs of full-length inserts and 246 contigs of partial inserts longer than 2 kb (Table S1). Inter-contig comparison showed that only four contigs had similar sequences: Contig785_n_1807_cl (9.1 kb, GenBank accession number: KC246876) and Contigcl_48 (20 kb, KC246849) shared 99% sequence similarity over 92% of the shorter contig, and Contig1490 (6.2 kb, KC247041) and Contig1831 (36.6 kb, KC246871) shared 93% sequence similarity over 75% of the shorter contig. All the other contigs shared little sequence similarity, suggesting that most of the 120 fosmid clones were derived from either different organisms or different chromosomal fragments of the same organism. In total, 3,553 open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted, and most of them have a starting codon (i.e., ATG) and a universal stop codon (i.e., TAA, TGA or TGA), suggesting that most of the ORFs probably represent full-length genes. The average length of all the predicted proteins was 347 amino acids, with a range from 19 to 3655 amino acids. To reflect the bioinformatic nature of the analysis, all the predicted ORFs with a putative predicted function were considered putative genes. Unlike shotgun sequencing that often produces a lot of gene fragments (e.g. 45% in the study by Hess [3]), targeted sequencing of fosmids expressing activities of particular interest produces more full-length genes. This has enabled detection of signal peptides in a relatively high proportion (16.5%) of the CAZy genes predicted. Conceivably, the full gene length probably also improved annotation accuracy and avoided artificial inflation of diversity estimates. TAXONOMIC ASSIGNMENT OF THE METAGENOMIC CONTIGS AND ORFS. No marker genes such as 16S rRNA genes were identified in this study. Thus, the taxonomic origins of 107 long contigs (> 10 Kb) were predicted using MEGAN 4 and PhyloPythiaS to infer the probable host organisms (Table S2). MEGAN could only assign most of the contigs to phylum level. PhyloPythiaS assigned most of the contigs to the sam",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,3400,far_neg_PMC,0.0053432565,0

24265854,"RIN1 regulates cell migration through RAB5 GTPases and ABL tyrosine kinases. RIN1 is a RAS effector protein. Through a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain, RIN1 activates RAB5 GTPases that promote early endosome maturation. In addition, RIN1 directly binds to and activates ABL tyrosine kinases., RIN1 associates directly with activated EGFR and binds STAM proteins that escort receptors to lysosomes for degradation. RIN1 sub-cellular localization, and hence its availability for interactions, is regulated by binding 14-3-3 proteins that favor cytoplasmic positioning. Overexpression of RIN1 in HeLa cells increased RAB5 activity and enhanced EGFR degradation compared with control cells, while silencing endogenous RIN1 had the opposite effect. The RIN1 GEF domain mutant RIN1E574A, which cannot activate RAB5 but can still activate ABL, suppressed RAB5 activity in a dominant negative manner and blocked EGFR degradation while it promoted receptor recycling. This confirmed a positive role for RAB5 stimulation in receptor internalization and was consistent with a role for ABL in protecting activated receptors from ubiquitylation and internalization.,. We further demonstrated that RIN1 undergoes EGF-dependent phosphorylation on Tyr36, emphasizing engagement of the RIN1 → ABL pathway following receptor stimulation. RIN1QM, a mutant that cannot activate ABL but still activates RAB5, caused dominant suppression of EGF-induced ABL kinase activation and accelerated EGFR degradation. HeLa cells expressing this mutant also showed greater RAB5 activation (Fig. 1) than did cells overexpressing wild type RIN1, implying that the RIN1 → ABL pathway normally modulates the RIN1 → RAB5 pathway during endocytosis. The influence of RIN1 signaling on EGFR degradation suggested the involvement of CBL, an E3 ubiquitin ligase for EGFR, because receptor ubiquitylation drives sorting and degradation. RIN1 overexpression increased CBL levels, consistent with RIN1 promoting EGFR::CBL interactions and accelerated EGFR degradation. RIN1QM dominantly blocked ABL kinase activity and enhanced CBL protein recruitment to EGFR, supporting a negative role for RIN1 → ABL signaling during CBL recruitment to EGFR. We noted that RIN1QM cells exhibited EGF-dependent macropinocytosis. In addition, EGF colocalized with macropinocytic membrane ruffles, demonstrating that an imbalance in RIN1 effector pathways can shift the mode of RTK endocytosis. Blocking RIN1 → RAB5 signaling stabilized EGFR and enhanced recycling, while blocking RIN1 → ABL caused enhanced macropinocytosis with increased receptor degradation. Notably, RAB5 activation has been linked to macropinocytosis through RAC1.,. Because receptor internalization and downregulation are directly relevant to chemotaxis, we examined the physiological significance of coordinated RAB5 and ABL signaling on cell migration toward a growth factor gradient. HeLa cells overexpressing wild type RIN1 showed a reduced rate of migration toward EGF, which was likely due to increased ABL activity. Expression of RIN1E574A (activates ABL but not RAB5) also decreased migration toward EGF, compared with cells expressing wild type RIN1 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, HeLa cells expressing RIN1QM showed significantly higher basal motility (no EGF gradient) compared with wild type RIN1 cells and, despite having less surface EGFR, migration toward EGF was similar to cells expressing wild type RIN1 (Fig. 2B). Hence the loss of RIN1 → ABL signaling, while RIN1 → RAB5 signaling persists, can enhance directed cell motility. This observation is consistent with macropinocytotic membrane ruffling and RAB5 activity being major contributors to cell migration, and suggests a mechanistic connection between RAS and RAC signaling pathways, as previously suggested., The macropinocytic and migratory phenotypes we observed also emphasize a role for RIN1 in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, a function well-established for ABL tyrosine kinases and strongly implied for RAB5 GTPases. The role of RIN1 signaling through RAB5 and ABL pathways in cell migration (this work) should be considered in the context of our previous work showing that BIN1, a BAR domain containing membrane-bending protein, is a RIN1 binding partner. RIN1’s proline-rich region mediates this interaction, possibly through the BIN1 SH3 domain as reported for in vitro binding of RIN3 to BIN1. EGF stimulation enhanced the RIN1::BIN1 interaction, suggesting that RIN1 recruits BIN1 to facilitate receptor endocytosis during migration. In addition, RIN1 sub-cellular localization appeared to influence receptor internalization, as revealed using RIN1S351A, a mutant with reduced 14-3-3 binding. Localized receptor responses are fundamental to efficient directional cell migration. We have proposed a working model to explain the broad integration of signaling pathways through RIN1 following receptor tyrosine kinase activation. Our findings demonstrate a key role for RIN1 as a regulator of membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton remodeling during receptor endocytosis and cell migration. A deeper mechanistic understanding will require examination of other endocytic events in epithelial cells. For example, invasive bacteria, such as Salmonella and Listeria, enter epithelial cells through macropinocytosis and receptor-mediated phagocytosis, respectively. RAB5 is a major player in both these entry mechanisms and functions in subsequent steps required for bacteria replication., ABL kinases have also been implicated in the entry of invasive bacteria. A role for RIN1 during pathogen entry could lead to identification of novel host cell drug targets for combating drug-resistant bacteria. Outside of epithelial cells, RIN1 is found most prominently in mature forebrain neurons where it inhibits certain types of learning. A deeper understanding of RIN1 signal orchestration may shed light on synaptic plasticity mechanisms. How RIN1 coordinates GTPase and tyrosine kinase pathways also has direct implications for treatment of cancers with RTK and RAS oncogene involve",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,3411,far_neg_PMC,0.914329,1
24271394,"Structural and functional analysis of the three MIF4G domains of nonsense-mediated decay factor UPF2. INTRODUCTION. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic mRNA quality control mechanism that recognizes transcripts with premature termination codons (PTC) and promotes their degradation. Thereby, NMD protects the cell from the potentially deleterious effects of C-terminally truncated proteins (1–6). In fact, ∼30% of all known disease-causing mutations in humans involve production of PTC-containing mRNAs (7). NMD also contributes to regulate the abundance of several physiological substrates, targeting 3–10% of the transcriptome in different organisms (8–10). Nine NMD protein factors, SMG1-9, have been identified in most metazoans (11,12), and recently four additional factors (SMG10, RUVLB1, RUVBL2 and RPB5) have been added to the components of the NMD machinery (13). The three UPF (UP-Frameshift) proteins, UPF1 (SMG2), UPF2 (SMG3) and UPF3 (SMG4) constitute the conserved core of NMD and are found in almost all eukaryotes with a few possible exceptions among protists (14–16), suggesting an ancient evolutionary origin for NMD. UPF1 is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that is directly involved in the recognition of terminating ribosomes stalled at a PTC (17–19). Human UPF2 (Q9HAU5) is an ∼140 kDa protein containing three conserved MIF4G (Middle portion of eIF4G) domains that are found in a number of proteins involved in RNA metabolism and translation such as the nuclear cap-binding protein CBP80 and eIF4G (eukaryotic initiation factor 4-gamma) (20). UPF2 interacts via its third MIF4G domain with UPF3b and via its C-terminal extremity with UPF1, thus forming the central component of the ternary complex of UPF proteins (21–23). UPF3b stably binds the exon junction complex (EJC) (24–26), which is deposited by the splicing machinery on the mRNA ∼24 nt upstream of the exon boundaries. The EJC functions as an enhancer of NMD efficiency in mammals (27–29) probably by serving as a recruitment platform for UPF3b (22,24,26) and UPF2 after mRNA export to the cytoplasm (16,30). Ribosomes stalled at a PTC are recognized by the NMD factors UPF1 and SMG1 to form the transient SURF complex, which consists of SMG1-UPF1-eRF1/3 a, SMG8 and SMG9 (12,19). SMG1 is an ∼415-kDa serine/threonine-protein kinase, essential for NMD in human and Caenorhabditis elegans (31), that belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–related kinase (PIKK) protein family (32). The EM structure of SMG1 in complex with SMG9 has been reported at 24 Å showing a characteristic head and arm architecture as observed previously for DNA-PKcs, another member of the PIKK family (33). Interaction of the SURF complex with NMD factors UPF2 and UPF3b positioned on a 3′ EJC is suggested to activate SMG1 to phosphorylate UPF1 in the ‘decay-inducing complex’ (DECID). UPF1 phosphorylation by SMG1 in the DECID leads to translation termination and dissociation of eRF3a from UPF1 (12,19). In addition, NMD factors SMG5-7 are recruited, which promote mRNA decay (34,35) and ultimately dephosphorylation of UPF1 (36). A major role in the interaction between the SURF and UPF2/3b-EJC complexes is played by UPF2 binding to UPF1. This interaction is mediated by the intrinsically disordered C-terminal extremity of UPF2, which structures on binding to the CH-rich domain of UPF1 (15). Moreover, an interaction between UPF2 and the SMG1 C-terminal region containing the kinase domain has been reported (19). A recent cryo-EM structure of the UPF1/2/3-EJC complex indicates that UPF2 acts as a central scaffolding protein with a ring-like arrangement of the MIF4G domains (37). According to the quasi-atomic model, UPF2 forms the crucial contacts with UPF1, UPF3b and the EJC and positions UPF1 toward the 3′-end of the mRNA where it could exert its helicase activity during mRNA degradation (37). High-resolution structural information of UPF2 is limited to the structure of the MIF4G-3 domain in complex with the RNP domain of UPF3b (16) and the UPF1-binding region in complex with UPF1 (15). The latter is separated from MIF4G-3 by a conserved low-complexity acidic region (88 residues, ∼50% Asp/Glu, indicated as LR3 in Figure 1A), which is likely to be disordered (15,23,38). Neither the structure nor the particular roles of the first two MIF4G domains of UPF2 are known. MIF4G domains have a conserved 3D structure, comprising an elongated bundle of antiparallel helices, despite high sequence divergence. They are thought to serve as molecular platforms for the recruitment of interaction partners (20,39–42) but could also be molecular spacers or scaffolds to correctly position distant functional regions. Here, we present the atomic resolution crystal structures of the N-terminal (MIF4G-1) and middle (MIF4G-2) domains of UPF2 and a lower resolution crystal structure of the combined UPF2 MIF4G-2/MIF4G-3 domains. These structures allow a refinement of the quasi-atomic model of the entire UPF-EJC complex. Furthermore, we test the importance of UPF2 MIF4G-1 and MIF4G-2 domains for NMD in vivo and identify the UPF2 MIF4G-3 domain as the SMG1 interaction site. We also show that SMG1 kinase phosphorylates UPF2 MIF4G-3 domain in vitro, mainly at the serine residue 1046. In vivo, however, the UPF2 mutation S1046A did not interfere with NMD in complementation experiments. These results highlight the central role of the UPF2 MIF4G-3 domain in the DECID complex since it interacts with both UPF3 and SMG1 kinase, perhaps activating the latter to phosphorylate UPF1.

24320083,"Methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) gene abundance correlates with activity measurements of methanogenic H₂ /CO₂ -enriched anaerobic biomass. INTRODUCTION. Anaerobic wastewater treatment is an environmentally and economically beneficial process in which the biological degradation of organic wastes results in the production of CH4 as a carbon-neutral energy source (Zitomer et al., 2008). Unfortunately, the widespread application of this ‘green’ technology has been hampered by concerns about process stability. Although treatment failure can be a serious problem, monitoring of anaerobic biomass can be used to measure the efficacy of bioaugmentation or system control used to prevent digester failure or encourage faster recovery of stressed digesters (Castellano et al., 2007; Schauer-Gimenez et al., 2010). Digester failure occurs when the microbial community is stressed by organic overload or toxicants or other abrupt environmental changes (Castellano et al., 2007). Therefore, the results of assays that rapidly monitor the microbial community in anaerobic biomass could provide useful information to operators seeking to manage digester function. In practice, however, the microorganisms in the anaerobic microbial community are rarely monitored directly. In fact, the microbial community in anaerobic digesters has been a black box throughout most of the history of this technology (Rivière et al., 2009). Specific methanogenic activity (SMA) assays, methane production rates, biogas composition, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, pH, granule morphology, acetate utilization rates, methanethiol concentration and quantification of volatile fatty acids have all been suggested or used to evaluate digester function (Coates et al., 1996; Zitomer et al., 2000; Castellano et al., 2007; Conklin et al., 2008; Molina et al., 2009). While these parameters are closely related to the metabolic functions of the microbial community, they do not directly quantify microorganisms. Successful removal of organic waste from the influent wastewater and methane production depend upon the collaborative efforts of the members of an interdependent microbial community, so knowledge of the structure and function of the community in anaerobic wastewater digesters can be very useful when attempting to stabilize or increase the efficiency of waste removal and biogas production. For example, SMA assays have been used to evaluate changes in biomass activity by quantifying the production of methane per the amount of volatile suspended solids (VSS) per unit time (Coates et al., 1996; 2005). The methanogens are the source of the methane, and they can be directly targeted using molecular microbiological methods. Methanogen genomes encode a unique operon for the enzyme methyl coenzyme M reductase (MCR). Previous studies have established that the presence and transcription of the gene for the alpha subunit of MCR (mcrA) can be used to detect the presence, abundance and/or activity of methanogens in natural and engineered environments (Springer et al., 1995; Luton et al., 2002; Juottonen et al., 2008; Gagnon et al., 2011; Kampmann et al., 2012; Munk et al., 2012). Other studies have demonstrated that the methane flux from peat and biogas production from anaerobic biomass correlated with the abundance of mcrA (Freitag and Prosser, 2009; Freitag et al., 2010; Traversi et al., 2012). Based in part on these reports, it was hypothesized that quantification of mcrA genes and/or transcripts by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) would correlate with SMA results and could thus be used in their stead. The substitution could provide a substantial benefit because qPCR assays can be completed within 24 h from biomass collection – whereas SMA assays can take up to 7–10 days to complete, giving digester operators information about the activity of the biomass much more rapidly than SMA assays. Herein, we report an evaluation of the use of qPCR of mcrA genes and transcripts in comparison with traditional SMA assays on the biomass from four different H2/CO2 enriched bioreactors. RESULTS. SMA ASSAYS. SMA values for assays using H2/CO2 (13 trials with three technical replicates each) ranged from 51.8 to 218.6 ml CH4 g−1 of VSS h−1 (Fig. 1). Mean SMA values for cultures R1 and R3 were significantly higher than those of R2 and R4 (P < 0.05 Kruskal–Wallis test, nonparametric multiple comparison test, Zar, 2010). SMA values from assays using acetate or propionate (one trial each with three technical replicates each) were below detection for all cultures. Volatile fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid, iso-butyric acid, butyric acid, iso-valeric acid and valeric acid) were less than 50 mg ml−1 in each culture (one trial). Culture pH averages from 30 days of monitoring were as follows (pH ± standard deviation): R1 (7.4 ± 0.18), R2 (7.27 ± 0.12), R3 (7.36 ± 0.15) and R4 (7.32 ± 0.14). QUANTITATIVE PCR AND REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE PCR (RT-PCR). qPCR was performed on DNA and RT-PCR products in a single run, and a disassociation (melt) curve was performed to check primer specificity. Critical parameters for the run were as follows: PCR efficiency, 110.5%, slope of standard curve, −3.093, y-intercept, 5.134, correlation coefficient, 0.949. The Ct for the no template control was 24.03 and > 26.5 for all the no-reverse transcriptase controls. The Ct value for the no template control can be explained by the observation of primer dimer formation; however, when template was present, no primer dimers were observed in the melt curve. All reported results were based on Ct values less than no-reverse transcriptase controls and were within the linear range of the standard curve. When the data from each date were compared, biomass from cultures R1 and R3 had greater mcrA gene copy ng−1 DNA and transcript numbers ng−1 RNA than did biomass from cultures R2 and R4 (Figs 1 and 2). Variations in mcrA copy number and transcript number were observed among the three samples of biomass taken from each of the enrichment cultures on different dates (Fig. 2A and B).

24324135,"Structural basis for 2'-phosphate incorporation into glycogen by glycogen synthase. Glycogen is a glucose polymer that contains minor amounts of covalently attached phosphate. Hyperphosphorylation is deleterious to glycogen structure and can lead to Lafora disease. Recently, it was demonstrated that glycogen synthase catalyzes glucose-phosphate transfer in addition to its characteristic glucose transfer reaction. Glucose-1,2-cyclic-phosphate (GCP) was proposed to be formed from UDP-Glc breakdown and subsequently transferred, thus providing a source of phosphate found in glycogen. To gain further insight into the molecular basis for glucose-phosphate transfer, two structures of yeast glycogen synthase were determined; a 3.0-Å resolution structure of the complex with UMP/GCP and a 2.8-Å resolution structure of the complex with UDP/glucose. Structural superposition of the complexes revealed that the bound ligands and most active site residues are positioned similarly, consistent with the use of a common transfer mechanism for both reactions. The N-terminal domain of the UDP-glucose complex was found to be 13.3° more closed compared with a UDP complex. However, the UMP · GCP complex was 4.8° less closed than the glucose complex, which may explain the low efficiency of GCP transfer. Modeling of either α- or β-glucose or a mixture of both anomers can account for the observed electron density of the UDP-glucose complex. NMR studies of UDP-Glc hydrolysis by yeast glycogen synthase were used to verify the stereochemistry of the product, and they also showed synchronous GCP accumulation. The similarities in the active sites of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase support the idea of a common catalytic mechanism in GT-B enzymes independent of the specific reaction catalyzed.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3429,pos_MEDLINE,0.9970247,1
24339986,"Structural characterisation of the nuclear import receptor importin alpha in complex with the bipartite NLS of Prp20. INTRODUCTION. A distinguishing feature of all eukaryotic cells is the containment of their genetic material within a stable and segregated nuclear organelle. This in turn requires the active, bidirectional transport of proteins and RNA across the nuclear envelope, a central process to a range of important cellular events including DNA replication, cell differentiation, and diseases including cancer and viral replication. In the classical nucleocytoplasmic transport pathway, the nuclear import receptor importin-α (IMPα) recognises a nuclear localisation signal (NLS) displayed on a cargo protein, and this dimer, through interaction with importin-β (IMPβ), is docked and translocated across the nuclear pore complex through interaction with nucleoporins [1]–[3]. Once in the nucleus, the IMPα:IMPβ:cargo complex is dissociated by RanGTP, and the IMPs are recycled back to the cytoplasm for a further round of import [4], [5]. The initial interaction of the nuclear import pathway between IMPα and the nuclear import cargo has been studied by a range of structural and functional approaches. IMPα, a large (529 residue) highly conserved macromolecule, is composed of 2 structural domains, a short basic 10 kDa N-terminal domain that binds importin-β (IBB domain), and a 50 kDa armadillo (ARM)-repeat NLS binding domain that recognises and binds NLSs of various cargo proteins [6], [7]. Interaction with the NLS generally occurs at the concave face of the ARM domains, at locations that are typically driven by the type of NLS; monopartite NLSs (composed primarily of a single cluster of positively charged residues) bind at the major NLS-binding site, and bipartitite NLSs, comprised of two positively charged separated by a 10–12 residue linker, bind by spanning both the major and minor sites of IMPα [7]–[9]. The usual nomenclature for describing the interactions between IMPα and NLSs [10], [11] designates residues binding in the minor site as P1′, P2′ etc., and residues binding the major site as P1, P2 etc. The consensus sequences correspond to K[K/R]X[K/R] (corresponding to positions P2–P5; [K/R] represents Lys or Arg, and X represents any amino acid) for monopartite and [K/R][K/R]X10–12[K/R]3/5 (corresponding to positions P1′–P2′ for the N-terminal basic cluster) cNLSs) for bipartite NLSs [6]. The directionality of the nuclear transport process is governed by the differential localisation of Ran across the nuclear envelope (reviewed in [12]–[14]). Specifically, the nucleotide bound state of Ran results in conformational changes in two surface loops of the protein, termed switch I and switch II, which in turn mediates its ability to dissociate importin:cargo complexes in the GTP-bound form [5], [15]. This is achieved through the asymmetric distribution of Ran regulatory proteins across the nuclear envelope, which modulate the nucleotide bound state of Ran; Ran guanidine exchange factor (RCC1/Prp20), predominately localised to the nucleus, maintains Ran in a GTP bound form that binds IMPs with high affinity and dissociates the complex upon nuclear entry; whilst RanGTPase activating protein (RanGAP), cytoplasmically located, maintains Ran in a GDP bound conformation. Thus, nuclear localisation of Prp20 plays a vital role in establishing the directionality of the nuclear localisation process. Previous studies have elucidated the region within Prp20 responsible for its nuclear localisation [16]–[18], however the detailed mechanism of its import remained to be fully determined. The NLS region is contained within the N-terminal 25 residues, and interacts with IMPα. Here, using x-ray crystallography, we elucidate the binding interface between IMPα and the NLS region of Prp20, and provide a structural comparison to other known IMPα:NLS cargo interaction interfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS. EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. Mouse IMPαΔIBB (residues 70–529) was overexpressed using thio-β-D-galactose (IPTG) method as outlined in [19]. The sample was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column (GE Healthcare), where cells were lysed by freeze-thawing in the presence of 20 mg of lysozyme, and cleared bacterial cellular extract injected onto a 5 mL HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) in His Buffer A (50 mM phosphate buffer, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8; AKTApurifier FPLC (GE Healthcare)), washed, and eluted with His Buffer B (50 mM phosphate buffer, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 8). Peak fractions were pooled and loaded onto a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.8, 125 mM NaCl, for size exclusion chromatography, where peak fractions were collected and added to a GST column loaded with GST-tagged Prp20 (S. cerevisiae RanGEF) NLS (residues 3–23, KRTVATNGDASGAHRAKKMSK23). Prp20 NLS was overexpressed as a GST-fusion protein using the autoinduction method as previously described in [6]. GST:Prp20 NLS was injected and immobilised on a GSTrap FF column (GE Healthcare), washed extensively in binding buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.8, 125 mM NaCl. Purified IMPαΔIBB was then passed over the column containing GST:Prp20 NLS, washed, and eluted in binding buffer containing 10 mM glutathione. The GST-tag was removed by overnight treatment of thrombin at 4°C, and the complex purified by a further round of size exclusion chromatography. The complex, in 20 mM Tris pH 7.8, and 125 mM NaCl, was then concentrated to 20 mg/mL (Amicon, MWCO 10 kDa, Millipore), aliquoted, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.

24349440,"Structures of Wnt-antagonist ZNRF3 and its complex with R-spondin 1 and implications for signaling. INTRODUCTION. Zinc RING finger 3 (ZNRF3) and its homolog RING finger 43 (RNF43) are trans-membrane E3 ubiquitin ligases that negatively regulate Wnt signaling [1,2]. Mutations in ZNRF3 or RNF43 have been linked to gastric adenocarcinoma [3], pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [4], liver fluke-associated cholangiocarcinoma [5] and mucinous ovarian tumors [6]. ZNRF3 and RNF43 contain an extracellular N-terminal protease-associated (PA) domain, a single pass trans-membrane helix and an intracellular C-terminal RING domain with E3 ligase activity [2]. Interaction of ZNRF3 or RNF43 with complexes of frizzled receptors (FZD) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5/6 leads to Frizzled ubiquitination and endocytosis of the heterodimeric receptors, thereby reducing the capacity of Wnt-driven signal transduction [1,2]. R-spondins 1-4 (RSPO1-4) are stem cell growth factors that bind leucine-rich repeat G-protein coupled receptors 4-6 (LGR4-6) on adult stem cells [7-10], such as in the intestine and colon [11], hair follicles [12], stomach [13], kidney [14], liver [15] and mammary glands [16]. LGR4-6 – R-spondin complexes potentiate Wnt signaling; however, the underlying mechanism is not completely resolved. It was recently reported that LGR4-RSPO1 complex interacts with ZNRF3 and facilitates the removal of ZNRF3 from the membrane, thereby indirectly increasing the number of Wnt receptor/co-receptor complexes on the cell surface [2]. Carmon et al., in contrast, observed that LGR5 forms a supercomplex with FZD-LRP5/6 upon stimulation with R-spondin 1 and Wnt3a and increases the rate of LRP6-FZD receptors internalization and degradation [17]; this model would contradict the role of LGR4/5-RSPO1 in increasing the number of Wnt receptors on the cell surface. Recent crystal structures [18-21] showed that RSPO1-4 bind LGR4-6 at the concave surface of the extended leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region of the LGR ectodomain. The ‘phenylalanine clamp’ of RSPO furin-like (Fu) 2 domain is critical for binding to the hydrophobic patch on LRR3-9. In addition, we observed 2:2 LGR5-RSPO1 complexes in four crystal forms [18]. However, such quaternary arrangement was not observed in LGR4-RSPO1 structure [20,21]. Here, we present crystal structures of the ectodomain of ZNRF3 and its complex with RSPO1. RSPO1 binds ZNRF3 primarily through its Fu1 domain and Fu2 exhibits domain flexibility in the absence of LGR4/5. Mutations in RSPO4 implicated in congenital anonychia [22] correspond to RSPO1 residues that mediate interactions with ZNRF3. Furthermore, superposition of the ZNRF3-RSPO1 with the LGR5-RSPO1 structures shows that ZNRF3 overlaps with the dimeric partner LGR5 in the 2:2 LGR5-RSPO1 complexes. Thus, interaction of ZNRF3 with LGR5-RSPO1 would block or disrupt this quaternary arrangement. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. STRUCTURE OF ZNRF3 PROTEASE-ASSOCIATED DOMAIN. The ectodomain of ZNRF3 was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. The protein was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and gel-filtration. Size-exclusion chromatography and multi-angle laser-light scattering indicated that ZNRF3 exists as monomer in solution (data not shown). Purified protein was crystallized and crystals exhibited space group P21 with cell dimensions a = 35.7 Å, b = 73.5 Å and c = 58.6 Å and β = 97.5°, contained two molecules per asymmetric unit and diffracted to 1.5 Å resolution. Crystallographic data and refinement statistics are given in Table 1; electron density is shown in Figure S1A. The ZNRF3 ectodomain adopts a typical PA-fold, previously found in e.g. subtilases, transferrin receptors and vacuolar sorting receptors [23,24]. The central core of the molecule is formed by a parallel β-sheet, consisting of strands β3-β4-β5-β6 surrounded by three α-helices and two short 310-helices (Figure 1A). A disulphide bond Cys107-Cys136, which is present in both ZNRF3 and RNF43 connects the loop regions containing the first and second 310-helices. The N-terminal and C-terminal residues of the ectodomain form an anti-parallel β-sheet, β2-β1-β7, that packs against helix α3. Consequently, the termini formed by extensions of strands β1 and β7 are close together in space. A linker of approx. 10 residues connects the C-terminus of the ectodomain (Figure 1A) to the trans-membrane helix in the lipid bilayer. The overall fold of the ZNRF3 ectodomain is similar to the ectodomain of its homolog RNF43, which is in agreement with a sequence identity of 37% between the two ectodomains (Figure 1B and S2). The Cα-positions of ZNRF3 and RNF43 (PDB code 4KNG) [19], can be superimposed on each other with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.75 Å. The largest structural difference between ZNRF3 and RNF43 is observed for the N-terminal strands β1 and β2. In ZNRF3, strands β1 and β2 form an extended β-hairpin ‘flap’, while RNF43 is three residues shorter and displays a flexible loop in this region. Furthermore, DALI search identified RNF128 (also known as GRAIL) to have a related fold (Figure 1B), despite low sequence identity of 15% and a rmsd of 5.3 Å compared to ZNRF3, suggesting that the ectodomains of the Goliath family E3 ligases (such as RNF13, RNF130, RNF133, RNF148, RNF149, RNF150, RNF167 and RNF204) [25] have related folds for ligand recognition. In the crystal structure of ZNRF3, we observe two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 1C). The two molecules pack together making an extensive interface burying over ~1,000 Å2 surface area. The extended β1-β2 flaps fold over the other monomer and provide small hydrophobic and aromatic interaction clusters with Val64, Phe66, Gly72 and Tyr74 interacting with Leu115’ and Y118’ preceding strand β4 and Gly150’ preceding β5 (where prime indicates residues from the opposing dimer), on both sides. Furthermore, a charged and H-bonded network is observed, which includes: Asp73-Arg145’, Tyr74-Tyr116’, Tyr74-Gln148’, Glu95-Glu95’, Glu95-Arg178’ and Glu95-Arg202’.

24391509,"NCYM, a Cis-antisense gene of MYCN, encodes a de novo evolved protein that inhibits GSK3β resulting in the stabilization of MYCN in human neuroblastomas. INTRODUCTION. Gene evolution has long been thought to arise from pre-existing genes through duplication or rearrangement followed by rapid divergence [1]–[5]. De novo gene birth from non-coding genomic regions has been generally believed to be exceptionally rare [1]. However, recent studies using genome-wide analyses have suggested the presence of a large number of de novo evolved genes in some species [3], [5]–[11], including primates [12]–[17]. Studies in yeast revealed that the proteins produced from de novo genes were not insignificant polypeptides but functional proteins [6], [7] and that de novo gene birth could be a major mechanism of new gene generation [6]. In multicellular organisms, however, the functions of de novo evolved proteins have been poorly characterized [3], [15], and thus their pathophysiological significance has remained elusive. Therefore, it is still unclear whether de novo gene birth is a general mechanism throughout evolution for the creation of functional protein-coding genes. Neuroblastoma is one of the most common solid tumors in children. It originates from the neuronal precursor cells of the sympathoadrenal lineage of the neural crest [18]. Its clinical behavior is enigmatic; the tumors in patients of less than one year of age often regress spontaneously, whereas the tumors detected in patients over one year of age are usually aggressive and eventually cause the patient's death despite intensive multimodality therapies [18]. The MYCN oncogene is frequently amplified in those tumors that occur in patients who are over one year of age at diagnosis [19], [20]. Transgenic mice expressing human MYCN in sympathoadrenal tissues spontaneously develop neuroblastomas [21], suggesting that MYCN alone can initiate tumorigenesis and promote tumor growth. However, unlike human neuroblastoma, its distant metastasis is infrequent. Furthermore, in human neuroblastomas without MYCN amplification, MYCN mRNA expression levels do not correlate with the prognosis of the patients [22], [23], suggesting that additional events might contribute to the acquisition of increased aggressiveness. We focused on NCYM as a candidate gene that promotes the aggressiveness of MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas. NCYM is a cis-antisense gene of MYCN [24], [25] and is co-amplified with MYCN in human neuroblastoma cells. NCYM is transcribed in the opposite direction to MYCN, starting from intron 1 of the MYCN gene (Figure 1A), and it has remained unclear for a long time whether the gene encodes a functional protein [24], [26]. In this study, we have found that NCYM is indeed a functional protein that regulates MYCN function in human, but not mouse, neuroblastoma. RESULTS. NCYM IS A DE NOVO EVOLVED GENE. We first analyzed the genomic sequence of NCYM in various species and found that in humans and chimpanzees the potential NCYM protein is composed of 109 amino acids (Figure 1B, Figure S1). We next searched for paralogs and orthologs of the human NCYM protein among other animals using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) databases with an E-value threshold of 10−3. We did not find any paralogs, but identified orthologs for a probable NCYM protein in olive baboons, chimpanzees and pigmy chimpanzees. From here on, we focused on the NCYM gene of the hominidae to investigate the function of the protein product. The evolutionary rates between the indicated species suggest that the coding sequence of NCYM gene was exposed to positive selection in humans and chimpanzees (Figure 1C), and the amino acid frequencies in these species were significantly different from the uniform usage of amino acids (P<0.001; Figure S2). We next raised an antibody against the putative human NCYM protein, and identified a 12 to 15 kDa protein in human neuroblastoma cells which mainly localized to nuclei in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells (Figure S3, Figure S4). The NCYM protein was expressed in a variety of normal human tissues, including the neuronal cells of the cerebrum and cerebellum, spermatocytes of the testis, pancreatic cells and also the heart (Figure S5). NCYM was also localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in these cells (Figure S5A–D). NCYM was expressed in both primary and metastatic human neuroblastomas (Figure 1D, Figure S5E and F), and was co-expressed with the MYCN protein in cells of human neuroblastomas (Figure 1D and E) and the neuronal cells of the human cerebrum (Figure 1F and G). It was also co-expressed with the MYCN protein in some primary human cancers, including thyroid cancer (Figure S6). Thus, the NCYM protein is a de novo evolved gene product and is endogenously expressed in both normal human tissues and cancers. PROGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF NCYM EXPRESSION IN HUMAN NEUROBLASTOMA. We next examined the prognostic significance of NCYM mRNA expression in human neuroblastoma. The NCYM gene was co-amplified with the MYCN gene in all the cell lines and primary neuroblastomas we examined (Figure S7). NCYM expression levels were significantly correlated with that of MYCN in primary neuroblastomas (n = 106, P = 4.69×10−16; Figure 2A) and in the tumors with a single copy of MYCN (n = 86, P = 1.11×10−13; Figure 2B). In addition, high levels of NCYM mRNA expression were significantly associated with unfavorable prognostic factors (P<0.05, Table S1) and a poor outcome (P = 3.70×10−5; Figure 2C), similar to that for MYCN mRNA expression (P<0.05; Table S1 and P = 2.31×10−5; Figure 2D). Interestingly, high levels of NCYM mRNA expression were also significantly correlated with poor outcome in those patients diagnosed at over one year of age without MYCN amplification (n = 45, P = 0.0375; Figure S8A) whereas those of MYCN did not correlate with the prognoses (n = 45, P = 0.144; Figure S8B). Multivariate analysis of 106 primary neuroblastomas showed, as expected, that NCYM mRNA expression is not an independent prognostic factor from expression and amplification of MYCN (Table S2).

24410837,"Crystal structures of IspF from Plasmodium falciparum and Burkholderia cenocepacia: comparisons inform antimicrobial drug target assessment. BACKGROUND. Isoprenoids contribute to a myriad of essential biological functions, for example as the prenyl groups that anchor proteins to membranes, as components of respiratory membranes, enzyme cofactors, and as scaffolds for the assembly of glycan structures [1-4]. Two distinct biosynthetic routes supply the universal isoprenoid-precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is present in animals, fungi and archaea while the 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway is widely distributed in bacteria, algae and several apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium species responsible for malaria [5,6]. Both MVA and MEP pathways occur in plants; the former operates in the cytoplasm and the latter in chloroplasts [7]. In most apicomplexan parasites the components of the MEP pathway are localized to an organelle known as the apicoplast, a relict chloroplast, which is also responsible for additional biosynthetic processes [8]. The organelle, which resembles a cyanobacterium is thought to have been acquired from an ancestral endosymbiotic event with an alga. All MEP pathway enzymes in P. falciparum are synthesized in the cytoplasm but they carry an apicoplast targeting sequence, which then drives localization [8]. The disruption of apicoplast replication results in parasites that are isopentenyl pyrophosphate auxotrophs [9]. Part of the interest in the MEP pathway concerns antimicrobial drug research and several observations support the idea that the pathway contains potential drug targets, enzymes whose inhibition may provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity [5,6]. We identified the Zn2+-dependent 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase [EC: 4.6.1.12] the fifth enzyme in the pathway as a target of interest. This enzyme, also known as IspF, catalyzes the conversion of 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2-phosphate (CDP-MEP) to 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) and cytidine monophosphate (CMP, Figure 1). We considered a diverse set of criteria that have been established as key with respect to target assessment for early stage antimicrobial drug discovery [10]. These criteria include genetic and chemical validation of the target, and the availability of accurate structural information and appropriate reagents to guide the development of structure-activity relationships. Three primary factors were taken into consideration. First, genetic methods have identified that individual components of the pathway, including IspF are essential for bacterial survival. For example, the essentiality of the ispF gene for growth and survival of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis is established [11-15]. Secondly, this pathway is absent from humans [5,6] potentially mitigating against toxicity issues. Thirdly, chemical validation of the pathway is provided by the antibacterial fosmidomycin, a potent inhibitor of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase, an enzyme that contributes to an early stage in the pathway. This last point regarding validation is reinforced by further work, which shows that fosmidomycin and derivatives are also efficacious in killing P. falciparum[16-18]. Previous studies have provided insight into aspects of IspF structure, specificity, and mechanism [19-22]. The structure of IspF has been derived from a dozen species in addition to the two new ones disclosed in this publication. More recently new IspF ligands including potent inhibitors have been identified [23-25], some of which have also been shown to inhibit the growth of P. falciparum within infected erythrocytes with respectable IC50 values of 1.4-1.6 μM [26]. These approaches have been complemented by NMR-based fragment screening and co-crystallization efforts targeting IspF from B. pseudomallei (BpIspF) [27]. AIMS. We sought to further inform the assessment of IspF as a drug target with crystallographic studies of the enzyme from two serious human pathogens, the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia (BcIspF) and the parasitic protozoan Plasmodium falciparum (PfIspF). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. THE STRUCTURE OF ISPF. Efficient recombinant protein production systems, purification protocols and reproducible crystallization conditions have been established for BcIspF and PfIspF leading to yields of up to 25 mg L-1 and 2.5 mg L-1of E. coli culture respectively. High-resolution crystal structures of BcIspF in complex with CMP or citrate, and of PfIspF in complex with CDP, as well as an unliganded PfIspF structure have been determined. Crystallographic statistics are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The calculated masses of the BcIspF and PfIspF subunits are 19.3 kDa and 20.5 kDa respectively and the polypeptide folds into a single α/β domain that consists of a four-stranded mixed β-sheet on one side with three α-helices on the other (Figure 2). IspF forms a stable homotrimer as observed in size-exclusion chromatography, which returns an estimate of 60 kDa for each. In all IspF crystal structures three subunits form a compact bell-shaped assembly approximately 45 Å by 60 Å in the axial and equatorial dimensions respectively (Figure 2). A surface area approximately equivalent to that of one subunit is buried on oligomerization. The accessible surface area (ASA) of an IspF monomer averages out as approximately 8130 Å2 for BcIspF and 8680 Å2 for PfIspF. The ASA for the BcIspF trimer is 16080 Å2, and for the PfIspF trimer 18180 Å2. In the case of BcIspF the asymmetric unit consists of three subunits, chains A, B, C, which are related by three-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS). NCS is high with least squares overlays of 161Cα positions in the range 0.2 - 0.3 Å. One subunit is present in the asymmetric unit of PfIspF and the trimer is generated by the symmetry operations (−x + y, -x, z) and (−y, x-y, z).

24412063,"The intrinsically disordered Sem1 protein functions as a molecular tether during proteasome lid biogenesis. SUMMARY. The intrinsically disordered yeast protein Sem1 (DSS1 in mammals) participates in multiple protein complexes, including the proteasome, but its role(s) within these complexes is uncertain. We report that Sem1 enforces the ordered incorporation of subunits Rpn3 and Rpn7 into the assembling proteasome lid. Sem1 uses conserved acidic segments separated by a flexible linker to grasp Rpn3 and Rpn7. The same segments are used for protein binding in other complexes, but in the proteasome lid they are uniquely deployed for recognizing separate polypeptides. We engineered TEV protease-cleavage sites into Sem1 to show that the tethering function of Sem1 is important for the biogenesis and integrity of the Rpn3-Sem1-Rpn7 ternary complex but becomes dispensable once the ternary complex incorporates into larger lid precursors. Thus, although Sem1 is a stoichiometric component of the mature proteasome, it has a distinct, chaperone-like function specific to early stages of proteasome assembly. INTRODUCTION. Most protein degradation within eukaryotic cells is mediated by the 26S proteasome (Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2013). This 2.5 MDa complex has a proteolytic core particle (CP) capped on its ends by the 19-subunit regulatory particle (RP). The RP recognizes and removes the substrate polyubiquitin targeting signal, unfolds the substrate, and translocates it into the CP. The RP can be subdivided into two complexes, the base and lid. The base contains the substrate recognition and unfoldase activities, whereas the lid provides the major deubiquitylating activity. Three types of subunits constitute the lid: six α-helical PCI (proteasome/cyclosome/ initiation complex) domain subunits, Rpn3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 12; two MPN (Mpr1/Pad1, N-terminal) subunits, Rpn8 and the deubiquitylase Rpn11; and a small, minimally structured protein, Sem1 (DSS1 in mammals). The PCI subunits arrange via their PCI domains into a horseshoe shape in the order Rpn9-Rpn5-Rpn6-Rpn7-Rpn3-Rpn12 (Lander et al., 2012; Lasker et al., 2012). Their C-terminal α-helices form an intricate helical bundle (Estrin et al., 2013),(Beck et al., 2012), while their N-terminal a-helical domains extend outward like fingers from this horseshoe. Rpn8 and Rpn11 are cradled in the PCI-domain horseshoe. The exact position of Sem1 within the lid is not certain but appears to be closely associated with Rpn3 and Rpn7 (Bohn et al., 2013; Gudmundsdottir et al., 2007; Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2011; Wei et al., 2008). Sem1 remains the most enigmatic of the proteasome subunits. It is also a component of additional complexes. Specifically, it is part of the TREX-2 mRNA-export complex (Thp1-Sac3-Sem1-Sus1-Cdc31) and another complex potentially involved in transcriptional regulation, which contains the Csn12 and Thp3 proteins (Faza et al., 2009; Wilmes et al., 2008). In some species (not S. cerevisiae), Sem1 orthologs bind the tumor suppressor BRCA2 (Marston et al., 1999). How Sem1 partitions appropriately between these complexes and whether it serves a similar function in all of them is unknown. Crystal structures of BRCA2-DSS1 and Thp1-Sac3-Sem1 complexes have been determined (Ellisdon et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2002). Sem1 (DSS1) adopts similar binding configurations in both models. In each structure, it is wrapped around a single protein (BRCA2 or Thp1), burying large surface areas. The buried regions consist primarily of two acidic stretches (here called site 1 and site 2) separated by ∼20 residues in the Sem1 sequence, which we term the linker (Figure 1A). Both sites interact with basic patches on the surface of the Sem1 binding partner; site 2 also bears two conserved tryptophan residues that occupy hydrophobic pockets on BRCA2 or Thp1. In both crystal structures, large stretches of the Sem1 sequence remain disordered, and the portions of Sem1 that are visible show limited secondary structure. Sem1 has been reported to bind proteasome subunits Rpn3 or Rpn7 in isolation (Bohn et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2008); whether Sem1 can simultaneously bind both subunits in assembly intermediates or within full proteasomes is unknown. Proteasome assembly must occur with high efficiency and fidelity. Both the CP and RP base rely on dedicated assembly chaperones for efficient assembly (Funakoshi et al., 2009; Hirano et al., 2006; Hirano et al., 2005; Kaneko et al., 2009; Kusmierczyk et al., 2008; Le Tallec et al., 2007; Le Tallec et al., 2009; Park et al., 2009; Ramos et al., 1998; Roelofs et al., 2009; Saeki et al., 2009). By contrast, no specific extrinsic factors are required for RP lid assembly. Instead, the lid seems to rely on a hierarchical assembly mechanism mediated in part by C-terminal helical extensions from the PCI and MPN domains (Estrin et al., 2013; Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2011). Formation of Rpn5/6/8/9/11 and Rpn3/7/Sem1 complexes (called Module 1 and lid particle 3 (LP3), respectively) appears to occur via parallel pathways (Estrin et al., 2013; Fukunaga et al., 2010; Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2011). Module 1 and LP3 were proposed to then associate to form the 8-subunit lid particle 2 (LP2) assembly intermediate. Lid assembly culminates with the docking of Rpn12 onto LP2, which serves as the signal for subsequent association of the lid and base subcomplexes (and Rpn10) to complete RP assembly (Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2011). Whether Sem1 contributes to lid assembly is not known; 26S proteasomes purified from sem1Δ yeast display no gross structural defects (Bohn et al., 2013), but mutant sem1Δ cells have fewer full proteasomes and accumulate subcomplexes of the lid (Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2011), suggesting a possible assembly function. Here we describe a novel, assembly factor-like role for Sem1 in proteasome lid biogenesis. We find that Sem1 chaperones proteasomal lid assembly by tethering Rpn3 to Rpn7 during LP3 formation and enforcing their concerted incorporation into the assembling lid. Importantly, this tethering function is no longer required upon for",PMC,pos,1,pos,3460,pos_PMC,0.997917,1
24438162,"Structure of cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) trapped in different conformations using nanobodies. INTRODUCTION. Kinases are highly dynamic enzymes and key regulators of signalling pathways. The proper timely and spatial activation of these pathways requires fine tuning and a tight regulation of the proteins involved. In a crystal structure only one conformation of a kinase is trapped and stabilized by crystal contacts. Understanding the function of a kinase requires understanding of its structural plasticity and, as a consequence, the generation of multiple structures in diverse conformations. GAK (cyclin G-associated kinase) is a member of the NAK (numb-associated kinase) family, which in humans also includes STK16 (serine/threonine kinase 16)/MPSK1 (myristoylated and palmitoylated serine/threonine kinase 1), AAK1 (adaptor-associated kinase 1) and BIKE [BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2)-inducible kinase]. This small subfamily of kinases is located in the centre of the kinase phylogenetic tree and shows a large sequence and structure diversity to other kinases as well as within the NAK subfamily [1]. GAK was originally identified as an association partner of cyclin G and CDK5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) [2]. It is essential for clathrin trafficking, mediating binding of clathrin to the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network, and regulating receptor signalling by influencing trafficking downstream of clathrin-coated vesicles [3,4]. In addition to its role in the cytoplasm, GAK has important functions in the nucleus. It is required for the maintenance of proper centrosome maturation and progression through mitosis [5]. GAK plays a central role during development and GAK−/− mice die early in gestation. Deleting GAK in adult mice in an inducible knockout mouse model resulted in death of these animals after 3 weeks, demonstrating that GAK is also essential for the viability of adult mice. Tissue-specific conditional knockout of GAK in the skin, liver or developing brain also resulted in lethal phenotypes shortly after birth with severe alteration of the affected tissues and a failure of progenitor cells to differentiate [6]. The kinase activity of GAK plays an essential role in viability and mice expressing only a kinase-dead form of GAK also die shortly after birth. Death is caused by respiratory dysfunction due to altered distribution of surfactant protein [7]. This critical role for GAK in the maintenance of respiratory function is thought to be the cause of the side effects observed with the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) kinase inhibitor gefitinib, used in the treatment of patients with NSCLC (non-small-cell lung cancer), as GAK is potently inhibited by this drug [7]. Activation of kinases frequently occurs via phosphorylation of the activation loop, also called the T-loop, a stretch of usually 30–40 amino acids that is located between two conserved motifs found in kinases: the DFG (Asp/Phe/Gly) and APE (Ala/Pro/Glu) motifs. Of the NAK family of kinases only the structure of MPSK1 has been determined so far. This structure is characterized by an unusual activation segment comprising an additional β-sheet and a large α-helical insertion, termed the ASCH (activation segment C-terminal helix), which is anchored to the lower kinase lobe by a number of family-specific hydrophobic interactions [8]. This unusual arrangement has been predicted to be present in all NAK family members, but the presence of this atypical activation segment has not been confirmed experimentally. Nbs (nanobodies) are robust small (15 kDa) single domain antigen-binding fragments derived from heavy chain-only antibodies, naturally occurring in Camelids, which can efficiently be produced by a variety of different hosts [9,10]. They contain a more diverse structural repertoire of their paratopes than mouse or human antibodies, as their hypervariable loops can adopt new folds not observed in conventional mouse or human antibodies. Their antigen-recognition sites typically form a convex surface with a large CDR (complementarity-determining region) loop 3 (CDR3) capable of reaching antigen-binding pockets that are less antigenic for other types of binders. It is thought that this helps to compensate for the loss of repertoire caused by the loss of the combinatorial VH-VL diversity [11]. In addition, high solubility due to specific hydrophilic amino acids found in the framework-two regions between CDRs, as well as their resistance to temperature and denaturing, make them ideally suitable for application in structural biology [12,13]. High-affinity Nbs and other affinity reagents are thought to be conformation sensitive [14,15], thus using them in crystallization complexes can aid in the determination of conformation-specific structures of dynamic molecules such as kinases. In the present paper, we report the first crystal structures of the GAK catalytic domain. The apo structure of GAK revealed a dimeric assembly mediated by the disordered elongated activation segment that dislodges from the lower lobe to interact with a second kinase molecule. Weak association of the GAK kinase domain was also observed in solution using AUC (analytical ultracentrifugation). Additional GAK and Nb co-crystalization structures revealed two distinct kinase conformations: one capturing a conformation similar to the one observed in the unliganded GAK kinase domain confirming the dimeric arrangement in a different crystal form, and a second structure with an active conformation of GAK revealing a folded activation segment architecture characterized by the insertion of an unusual β-sheet and the ASCH that has also been described in MPSK1, suggesting a conserved architecture of the activation segment in NAKs. The different conformations observed in these three diverse crystal structures revealed a large degree of domain plasticity that include significant changes in the GAK active site providing a rational for the potent inhibition of GAK by a large diversity of kinase inhibitors.

24477416,"Implications of osteoblast-osteoclast interactions in the management of osteoporosis by antiresorptive agents denosumab and odanacatib. Antiresorptive agents, used in the treatment of osteoporosis, inhibit either osteoclast formation or function. However, with these approaches, osteoblast activity is also reduced because of the loss of osteoclast-derived coupling factors that serve to stimulate bone formation. This review discusses how osteoclast inhibition influences osteoblast function, comparing the actions of an inhibitor of osteoclast formation [anti-RANKL/Denosumab (DMAB)] with that of a specific inhibitor of osteoclastic cathepsin K activity [Odanacatib (ODN)]. Denosumab rapidly and profoundly, but reversibly, reduces bone formation. In contrast, preclinical studies and clinical trials of ODN showed that bone formation at some skeletal sites was preserved although resorption was reduced. This preservation of bone formation appears to be due to effects of coupling factors, secreted by osteoclasts and released from demineralized bone matrix. This indicates that bone resorptive activities of osteoclasts are separable from their coupling activities.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3469,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.002195515,0
24481047,"Polycystic kidney disease with renal calculi treated by percutaneous nephrolithotomy: a report of 11 cases. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) in the treatment of congenital autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) with renal calculi. METHODS A total of 11 cases of ADPKD with renal calculi were retrospectively studied. All cases were treated by PCNL and clinical parameters such as age, sex, stone burden, operation time, blood loss, complications and perioperative serum creatinine levels were collected and analyzed. All patients were routinely followed up for 36 months postoperatively and the efficacy and safety of PCNL in the management of ADPKD with renal calculi were assessed. RESULTS All procedures were successful without conversion to open surgery. The mean stone burden was 3.4 ± 0.7 cm (range 2.5-4.6 cm). The overall stone clearance rate was 81.8% (9/11). Two patients received extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy postoperatively because of residual calculi. The mean operation time was 77 ± 23.5 min (range 45-128 min) and the mean blood loss was 147 ± 56 ml (range 80-260 ml). The mean preoperative serum creatinine level was 15.13 ± 3.30 mg/dl (range 9.90-20.14 mg/dl) and the mean postoperative serum creatinine level was 14.28 ± 2.24 mg/dl (range 10.76-17.28 mg/dl). Four cases had fever postoperatively (36.4%). Three patients had hemorrhage and two patients received blood transfusion. No patient had peripheral viscera injury. Statistical comparison showed that PCNL had no impact on perioperative renal function (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In spite of anatomical deformation and impairment of renal function, PCNL is an effective and safe procedure in managing ADPKD with renal calculi.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3470,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0027629985,0
24492405,"Characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease serology in patients with indeterminate colitis. INTRODUCTION. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the mucosa of the intestinal tract. The majority of individuals with IBD have disease characteristics consistent with either Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histological features. A number of serum antibodies have also been associated with a diagnosis of CD or UC, including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA), perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), anti-outer membrane porin C antibody (anti-OmpC), and anti-CBir1 flagellin antibody (anti-CBir1). Published studies have reported the sensitivity and specificity of these antibody assays when distinguishing CD or UC from healthy or non-IBD diarrheal controls. The distinction between CD and UC at the time of initial diagnosis still has importance in patient management in this era; early intervention with biologic therapies has been advocated to reduce disease-related complications in CD, a strategy that is not the case in UC. In addition, the extent and type of surgical management of refractory disease is different for patients with UC and CD. Approximately 10–15% of individuals with features of IBD lack definitive evidence to discriminate between UC or CD; these individuals are typically described as having “indeterminate colitis” (IC). Although originally a descriptive term for colectomy specimens with features of both UC and CD, in clinical practice it encompasses those patients with chronic intestinal inflammation in which clinical features, including endoscopic and biopsy findings, are inadequate to make a definitive diagnosis of either UC or CD. In 2005, a Working Party at the World Congress of Gastroenterology proposed a new term, inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU), to classify these patients, although this has yet to become widely used. One of the outcomes of this Working Party was the recommendation that the role of serological markers be assessed in this patient population. In the view of some experts, the classification of IC is a provisional one and, over time or with further investigations, many of these patients will be re-classified as having CD or UC. However, only one published study to-date has examined the value of IBD serology assays specifically in patients with IC. The aim of this study was to define further the test characteristics of IBD serology in predicting a subsequent CD or UC diagnosis in a cohort of individuals with IC. MATERIALS AND METHODS. From an initial cohort of individuals who underwent IBD serology testing at a major academic medical center from 2001 to 2007, those diagnosed with IC and with at least one year follow-up after serology testing were selected. The electronic medical records (clinical notes, endoscopy, pathology and radiology reports) were reviewed by a single reviewer (SS) to confirm the established diagnosis of IC, with uncertain cases reviewed by the senior author (ACM). Only cases meeting the clinical criteria proposed by the International Organization for Inflammatory Bowel Disease for a diagnosis of IC were included; “patients who appear to have IBD colitis but who cannot be readily classified when all clinical, radiological, endoscopic, histologic, and serologic data are taken into account” . All individuals underwent ASCA, pANCA, and anti-OmpC testing (IBD Serology, Prometheus Inc., San Diego, CA). Eight of 117 individuals underwent anti-CBir1 antibody testing due to its late addition to commercially available panels. Positive tests were defined as values greater than assay reference values, similar to methodology used in prior studies. For ASCA, a positive IgA or IgG indicated a positive result. For pANCA, a positive ELISA test regardless of indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) result indicated a positive test. The appropriate institutional IRB approval was attained prior to initiating the retrospective chart review. Data collection involved review of clinician notes, laboratory data, imaging studies, pathology reports, and serology results. At one year following IBD serology testing, patient records and results were examined to establish clinical diagnosis at the follow-up time-point (IC, UC, or CD). The follow-up diagnosis of each subject was confirmed by the authors based on accepted criteria, and blinded to the serology results (Suppl. Table 1). Data analysis was conducted with JMP, Version 8 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). To determine associations between antibody and disease, Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for continuous outcomes and Pearson’s chi-square test for dichotomous outcomes. Two-by-two tables were used to calculate test characteristics. Finally, likelihood ratios for each antibody were also calculated to determine clinical usefulness, as performed in a prior study. Sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were based on calculations including only the inception IC cohort; healthy controls and patients with gastrointestinal illness without evidence of IBD were not included. RESULTS. CHARACTERISTICS OF IC COHORT. Of an initial cohort of individuals who underwent IBD serology testing from 2001 to 2007, 117 had a diagnosis of IC at the time of serology testing, and had at least one year of follow-up data (Table 1). Consistent with criteria for IC, all individuals had abnormal colonoscopies and evidence of chronic inflammation. Sixteen individuals also had abnormalities in the ileum noted on small bowel follow through and/or CT/MRI, in addition to continuous endoscopic colorectal involvement. Patients with prior colectomies for UC were classified as IC after developing subsequent manifestations suspicious for the alternative diagnosis (e.g. perianal fistulas or complicated pouchitis). Of the 117 patients with a diagnosis of IC at time of enrollment, 58 (50%) were reclassified as having UC, 49 (42%) as CD, and 10 (9%) remained classified as IC after 12 months follow-up.

2449651,"Lack of effect of gamma-globulin infusion on circulating immune complexes in patients with Kawasaki syndrome. Previous studies have demonstrated circulating immune complexes (CICs) in sera of 70% of Kawasaki syndrome (KS) patients but the pathogenic role of these complexes in the illness is unknown. Infusions of gamma-globulin (GG) have been shown recently to reduce the prevalence of coronary artery aneurysms in KS patients. One of the proposed mechanisms of action of GG therapy is through an effect on CICs. We analyzed paired sera for CICs from 29 patients with KS, 19 of whom were treated with aspirin and GG and 10 of whom received aspirin only. Assay systems used for CIC detection were Raji-mu enzyme immunoassay, C1q solid phase assay-enzyme immunoassay and F(ab')2-anti-C3-mu enzyme immunoassay. Overall 20 of 29 patients had CICs detected by at least two of three assays used. Of the 19 GG-treated patients 14 had CICs detected: 5 in both paired sera; 2 in pretherapy sera; and 7 posttherapy specimens. There was no correlation between duration of fever, presence of myocarditis or the development of coronary artery aneurysms and the presence of CICs in the serum of KS patients. Although CICs can be found frequently in the sera of KS patients there seems to be no association between the presence of CICs and the duration of fever or the development of coronary artery aneurysms.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3475,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.00478301,0
24502590,"Structural studies of yeast Δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (ALDH4A1): active site flexibility and oligomeric state. The mitochondrial enzymes Put1p and Put2p catalyze proline catabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Figure 1). Put1p is a flavin-dependent dehydrogenase that catalyzes the oxidation of l-proline to Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) and couples proline oxidation to reduction of ubiquinone. Put2p is a P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH, EC 1.2.1.88, formerly EC 1.5.1.12) and is also known as ALDH4A1 in reference to its membership in family 4 of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily. Put2p catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of γ-glutamate semialdehyde (GSA, the hydrolysis product of P5C) to l-glutamate. In total, the proline catabolic pathway catalyzes a four-electron oxidation of proline. Several studies have shown that proline is important in various organisms for stress protection. The accumulation of proline in yeast leads to improved freeze tolerance. In contrast to that of proline, the accumulation of P5C is associated with toxicity effects and induced cell death in yeast. Coordinated expression of PUT1 and PUT2 is important for avoiding buildup of P5C. The PUT1 and PUT2 genes are upregulated by proline under nitrogen limiting conditions and, together with glutamate dehydrogenase, allow yeast to utilize proline as a nitrogen source. The mechanism of P5C toxicity involves inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and an increased level of production of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, an N-acetyltransferase enzyme known as Mpr1 acetylates P5C, thereby decreasing its level of accumulation and weakening its harmful effects in yeast. Mammalian P5CDHs have been characterized biochemically. Early studies of the human (HsP5CDH) and rat enzymes established the order of substrate binding and product release, as well as substrate preferences. More recent work on HsP5CDH and mouse P5CDH (MmP5CDH) provided additional details about the kinetic mechanism and the molecular basis of type II hyperprolinemia, a metabolic disorder caused by a defect in ALDH4A1 function. The three-dimensional structures of P5CDHs have been studied intensely. Tahirov’s group reported the first P5CDH structure using the enzyme from Thermus thermophilus (TtP5CDH). We subsequently determined the structures of HsP5CDH and MmP5CDH, and the New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium has deposited structures of two Bacillus P5CDHs in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (entries 3QAN and 3RJL). Collectively, the structures confirmed P5CDH as a member of the ALDH superfamily, contributed additional information about the catalytic mechanism, and provided insight into the structural basis of cofactor and semialdehyde selectivity. We also determined the solution oligomeric states and quaternary structures of several P5CDHs. The human, mouse, and Bacillus enzymes are dimeric in solution, whereas TtP5CDH and Deinococcus radiodurans P5CDH (DrP5CDH) form trimer-of-dimers hexamers in solution. Thus, the protein fold, but not the oligomeric state, is conserved within the ALDH4A1 subfamily. Although the yeast PUT genes were identified more than 30 years ago, the Put1p and Put2p enzymes have remained relatively understudied. Wanduragala et al. reported the purification and characterization of Put1p in 2010, but analogous studies of Put2p have not appeared in the literature. We therefore have created a recombinant bacterial expression system for Put2p, measured the steady-state kinetic parameters of the purified enzyme, determined the crystal structure, and deduced the oligomeric state and quaternary structure in solution from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES. SUBCLONING AND MUTAGENESIS. The PUT2 gene was obtained from M. Brandriss of the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and subcloned into vectors pET14b using NdeI and XhoI and pKA8H between NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, resulting in pET14b-PUT2 and pKA8H-PUT2 constructs. DNA encoding residues 23–575, which lacks the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide, was amplified from pKA8H using AAACATATGAAGCCCCCCAAGCACATAAG as the forward primer and the T7 terminator as the reverse primer. The resulting fragment was subcloned into pKA8H using NdeI and BamHI to give the pKA8H-PUT2Δ22 construct. The expressed protein has an N-terminal His8 tag and tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. The W193A mutant of Put2p was created from pKA8H-PUT2Δ22 with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) using the forward primer (5′-GGTACAATCTACCGTTTGCTGACAGATCTGC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GCAGATCTGTCAGCAAACGGTAGATTGTACC-3′). The mutation was confirmed using DNA sequencing. EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION OF PUT2P. Put2p and Put2p mutant W193A were expressed in Bl21(DE3)pLysS cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C and 250 rpm until the OD600 reached 0.6 and induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 8 h at 22 °C and 200 rpm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 30 min and resuspended in 20 mM HEPES, 60 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol (pH 8.0). Cells were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until they were further purified. Thawed cells were broken by sonication and centrifuged at 16500 rpm for 1 h.

24503096,"Characterization of intracellular dynamics of inoculated PrP-res and newly generated PrP(Sc) during early stage prion infection in Neuro2a cells. SUMMARY. To clarify the cellular mechanisms for the establishment of prion infection, we analyzed the intracellular dynamics of inoculated and newly generated abnormal isoform of prion protein (PrPSc) in Neuro2a cells. Within 24 h after inoculation, the newly generated PrPSc was evident at the plasma membrane, in early endosomes, and in late endosomes, but this PrPSc was barely evident in lysosomes; in contrast, the majority of the inoculated PrPSc was evident in late endosomes and lysosomes. However, during the subsequent 48 h, the newly generated PrPSc increased remarkably in early endosomes and recycling endosomes. Overexpression of wild-type and mutant Rab proteins showed that membrane trafficking along not only the endocytic-recycling pathway but also the endo-lysosomal pathway is involved in de novo PrPSc generation. These results suggest that the trafficking of exogenously introduced PrPSc from the endo-lysosomal pathway to the endocytic-recycling pathway is important for the establishment of prion infection. INTRODUCTION. Prions are causative agents of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by accumulation of an abnormal isoform of prion protein (PrPSc) in the central nervous system (CNS). PrPSc is the only known proteinaceous component of prions, and infectivity of prions is thought to be associated with PrPSc oligomers (Silveira et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2010). PrPSc is a conformational isomer of a cellular prion protein (PrPC) and is rich in β-sheet; PrPSc is generated from PrPC, a protein that is expressed on the surface of host cells (Prusiner, 1998). Conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is thought to be triggered by direct contact between “seed” PrPSc and “substrate” PrPC. The intracellular dynamics of PrPSc immediately following exposure of the cells to prions have been analyzed to understand the mechanisms by which a prion infection becomes established. Although PrPC is not necessary for the internalization of PrPSc (Greil et al., 2008; Hijazi et al., 2005; Jen et al., 2010; Magalhaes et al., 2005; Paquet et al., 2007), some candidates such as laminin receptor, heparan sulfate, or low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) have been reported to act as receptors that mediate internalization of exogenously inoculated PrPSc (Gauczynski et al., 2006; Horonchik et al., 2005; Jen et al., 2010). During the early stage after inoculation of PrPSc, internalized PrPSc has been reported to be directed to late endosomes/lysosomes via the endo-lysosomal pathway (Jen et al., 2010; Magalhaes et al., 2005). In cells persistently infected with prions, a number of studies have shown that PrPSc localizes throughout the endocytic compartments – specifically the plasma membrane, early endosomes, recycling endosomes, late endosomes, secondary lysosomes, and the peri-nuclear Golgi region (Marijanovic et al., 2009; McKinley et al., 1991; Pimpinelli et al., 2005; Taraboulos et al., 1990; Veith et al., 2009; Vey et al., 1996; Yamasaki et al., 2012). Earlier studies suggested that generation of PrPSc occurs on the cell surface or within the endocytic pathway (Borchelt et al., 1992; Caughey and Raymond, 1991; Taraboulos et al., 1992). Marijanovic et al. reported that the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) may be the site where the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc occurs (Marijanovic et al., 2009). In a very early stage of prion infection where new PrPSc formation was measured within minutes after initiation of infection, Goold et al. recently reported that the plasma membrane is a primary site of conversion (Goold et al., 2011). In spite of the efforts described above, the events required for the establishment of prion infection in cells, especially those that occur in the early stage after introduction of the infectious prions, are poorly understood. Simultaneous analysis of inoculated PrPSc and newly generated PrPSc in a short period after challenge with prions is important for understanding the early events of prion infection. However, such analysis is limited due to the technical difficulties in the distinction of PrPSc from PrPC and also in the distinction of newly generated PrPSc from inoculated PrPSc. For example, antibody epitope-tagging has been used to specifically detect host cell-derived PrP or input PrPSc (Greil et al., 2008; Vorberg et al., 2004) but not both. Specific labeling of PrPSc with anti-PrP antibody via pre-treatment of cells with chaotropic agents such as guanidinium salt has been widely used to detect PrPSc in cells (Marijanovic et al., 2009; Pimpinelli et al., 2005; Taraboulos et al., 1990). However, this method is limited because weak PrPSc signals such as newly generated PrPSc may be lost or obscured because the detector gain or exposure times need to be adjusted to a level at which signals from endogenous PrPC are below the detection limit. We recently reported that mAb 132, an anti-PrP monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope consisting of amino acids 119-127 of mouse PrP, allowed us to visualize PrPSc in prion-infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) without specific manipulation of threshold setting to diminish PrPC signals (Yamasaki et al., 2012). Here, we established a method in which inoculated PrPSc and newly generated PrPSc can be distinguished by combining the use of fluorescent-dye-labeled purified proteinase K (PK)-resistant PrPSc (PrP-res) as inoculum with PrPSc-specific staining with mAb 132. By using this method, in the present study, we extensively analyzed the fate of the inoculated PrP-res and the appearance of newly generated PrPSc in Neuro2a cells during the early stages of prion infection. RESULTS. PURIFICATION AND LABELING OF PRP-RES.

24688736,"Biochemical and biophysical characterization of recombinant yeast proteasome maturation factor ump1. INTRODUCTION. The 26S proteasome is the central player in the degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway in eukaryotic cells [1, 2]. This ATP-dependent multimeric protease complex is composed of the catalytic core particle (CP), named 20S proteasome that can be capped in one or both ends by the 19S regulatory particle. Recently, the topology of the 26S proteasome was revealed by electron microscopy studies [3, 4, 5]. Earlier crystallographic studies had provided a detailed knowledge of the subunit arrangement of the 20S CP [6, 7]. The eukaryotic CP is composed of 14 distinct subunits, seven α and seven β subunits, organized in four stacked heptameric rings with an α1-7β1-7β1-7α1-7 arrangement. The proteolytic sites are sequestered in the internal part of the chamber formed by the two β rings [6, 7, 8]. The active 20S CP is the result of a highly coordinated assembly process involving several conserved and specific chaperones. The dimeric chaperones Pba1-Pba2 and Pba3-Pba4 (‘Pba’, ‘proteasome biogenesis-associated’; also known as ‘Poc1-Poc4’ for ‘Proteasome chaperone’,) are thought to promote assembly of rings composed of seven α subunits, the platform for binding of the β subunits [9]. Ump1 (ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis), originally identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was the first proteasome-specific assembly chaperone to be described [10]. Ump1, a ∼17 kDa short-lived protein, is found in precursor (or 15S) complexes called half-proteasomes that contain unprocessed β subunits [10, 11]. Besides Ump1, the 15S complexes contain all CP subunits, except for β7, and the chaperone Pba1-Pba2 [12, 13, –14]. Dimerization of two such complexes is triggered by incorporation of β7, whose C-terminal extension reaches out into the other half to stabilize the newly formed 20S particle [14, 15]. Ump1 is encased during precursor dimerization and is important for autocatalytic processing of β1, β2 and β5. Upon maturation of the active sites, Ump1 is rapidly degraded as the first substrate of the newly formed 20S CP [10, 16]. S. cerevisiae Ump1 is a conserved protein found in all eukaryotes [11]. The human ortholog, hUmp1, was shown to perform similar functions to its S. cerevisiae counterpart in proteasome biogenesis [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. In contrast to yeast Ump1, hUmp1 appears to be essential for viability, as suggested by siRNA knockdown experiments [19, 20]. It was reported that hUmp1 binds to membranes leading to precursor proteasome assembly at the endoplasmic reticulum [22]. Studies in S. cerevisiae suggested that Ump1-containing precursor complexes are imported into the nucleus where the assembly of nuclear proteasomes is completed [23]. At present, no three-dimensional structure of Ump1 proteins is available, although there is some information on their functional domains. The C-terminal region, encompassing residues 51-147 of yeast Ump1 or 61-141 of human Ump1, is required and sufficient for interaction with proteasome precursor complexes. Residues 68 to 72 of hUmp1 are essential for this interaction [17]. By contrast, the region containing the first 50 amino acid residues of Ump1 is neither sufficient nor required for incorporation of Ump1 into precursor complexes [17]. These Ump1 regions are likely to operate by interacting with distinct substructures of different proteasome subunits. Indeed, hUmp1 binds directly to several α and β subunits and associates with α rings in vitro [19, 22, 24]. In line with this finding, hUmp1 appears to be essential for the binding of the β2 subunit to α ring precursor complexes, and therefore for the initiation and assembly of β rings [24]. In vitro experiments showed that hUmp1 binds directly to the β5 subunit [24]. Interestingly, the yeast β5 propeptide becomes dispensable in cells lacking Ump1, but is essential for viability in its presence [10, 25]. In vivo depletion of hUmp1 by siRNA experiments, however, prevented the incorporation of β5 into nascent proteasome precursor complexes [19]. Here we report the biochemical and biophysical characterization of recombinant yeast Ump1. Ump1 purified as a heterogeneous mixture of monomers and dimers. Dimer formation is mediated by Cys115. Mutation of this single cysteine to serine abolished dimer formation leading to preparations enriched in monomeric Ump1. Nevertheless, the purified mutated monomers were conformationally too heterogeneous to crystallize. A comparative biophysical analysis showed that Ump1 displays characteristics of a natively disordered protein. This biophysical property is independent of the oligomeric state of the protein and suggests that Ump1 structure might be stabilized upon interaction with proteasomal subunits and concomitant incorporation into proteasomal precursor complexes. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. The plasmid pJD492-UMP1 was designed to express UMP1-6xHis yielding a non-cleavable C-terminally 6His-tagged version of S. cerevisiae Ump1. A PCR fragment, containing the nucleotide sequence of the complete UMP1 ORF, was cloned into pET11a using XbaI and BamHI restriction sites. The plasmid encodes the full-length Ump1 followed by the additional amino acid sequence GYHHHHHH. This plasmid was used as a template for construction of the mutant plasmid pJD492-UMP1-C115S by PCR. The following primers were synthesized to introduce the mutated sequence: 5′-CTA CTG AAC AAA GAG TCC AGC ATC GAT TGG GAG-3′ and 5′-CTC CCA ATC GAT GCT GGA CTC TTT GTT CAG TAG -3′ (bold represents mutation site). The mutation was confirmed by sequencing (Eurofins). Both plasmids encoding the 6His-tagged versions of yeast Ump1 under the control of a T7 promotor were used to transform E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (Stratagene) competent cells. For expression of S. cerevisiae Ump1 and Ump1-C115S, E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (Stratagene) transformed with the expression plasmids were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol (final concentr",PMC,pos,1,pos,3529,pos_PMC,0.9954791,1
24704038,"Homodimerization propensity of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of Ultraspiracle from Aedes aegypti. The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the principal vector of dengue, one of the most devastating arthropod-borne viral infections in humans. The isoform specific A/B region, called the N-terminal domain (NTD), is hypervariable in sequence and length and is poorly conserved within the Ultraspiracle (Usp) family. The Usp protein together with ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) forms a heterodimeric complex. Up until now, there has been little data on the molecular properties of the isolated Usp-NTD. Here, we describe the biochemical and biophysical properties of the recombinant NTD of the Usp isoform B (aaUsp-NTD) from A. aegypti. These results, in combination with in silico bioinformatics approaches, indicate that aaUsp-NTD exhibits properties of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). We also present the first experimental evidence describing the dimerization propensity of the isolated NTD of Usp. These characteristics also appear for other members of the Usp family in different species, for example, in the Usp-NTD from Drosophila melanogaster and Bombyx mori. However, aaUsp-NTD exhibits the strongest homodimerization potential. We postulate that the unique dimerization of the NTD might be important for Usp function by providing an additional platform for interactions, in addition to the nuclear receptor superfamily dimerization via DNA binding domains and ligand binding domains that has already been extensively documented. Furthermore, the unique NTD-NTD interaction that was observed might contribute new insight into the dimerization propensities of nuclear receptors.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3532,pos_MEDLINE,0.99776566,1

The amino acid sequence of a 90-residue segment of human pregnancy zone protein containing its bait region has been determined. Human alpha 2-macroglobulin, human pregnancy zone protein, and rat alpha 1-macroglobulin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, and alpha 1-inhibitor 3 variants 1 and 2 constitute a group of homologous proteins; but the sequences of their bait regions are not related, and they differ in length (32-53 residues). The alpha-macroglobulin bait region is located equivalently with residues 666-706 in human alpha 2-macroglobulin. In view of the extreme sequence variation of the bait regions, the evolutionary constraints for these regions are likely to differ from those of the remainder of the alpha-macroglobulin structure. The sites of specific limited proteolysis in the bait regions of human pregnancy zone protein and rat alpha 1-macroglobulin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, and alpha 1-inhibitor 3 variants 1 and 2 by a variety of proteinases differing in specificity have been determined and compared with those identified earlier in human alpha 2-macroglobulin. The sites of cleavage generally conform to the substrate specificity of the proteinase in question, but the positions and nature of the P4-P4' sites differ. Most cleavages occur in two relatively small segments spaced by 6-10 residues; and in each case, bait region cleavage leads to alpha-macroglobulin-proteinase complex formation. The rate at which a given proteinase cleaves alpha-macroglobulin bait regions is likely to show great variation.

24793651,"Structural basis of starvation-induced assembly of the autophagy initiation complex. Assembly of the preautophagosomal structure (PAS) is essential for autophagy initiation in yeast. Starvation-induced dephosphorylation of Atg13 is required for the formation of the Atg1-Atg13-Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 complex (Atg1 complex), a prerequisite for PAS assembly. However, molecular details underlying these events have not been established. Here we studied the interactions of yeast Atg13 with Atg1 and Atg17 by X-ray crystallography. Atg13 binds tandem microtubule interacting and transport domains in Atg1, using an elongated helix-loop-helix region. Atg13 also binds Atg17, using a short region, thereby bridging Atg1 and Atg17 and leading to Atg1-complex formation. Dephosphorylation of specific serines in Atg13 enhanced its interaction with not only Atg1 but also Atg17. These observations update the autophagy-initiation model as follows: upon starvation, dephosphorylated Atg13 binds both Atg1 and Atg17, and this promotes PAS assembly and autophagy progression.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3550,pos_MEDLINE,0.9974885,1
24793951,"Risk factors associated with anaphylaxis and other allergic-like events following receipt of 2009 monovalent AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine in Quebec, Canada. INTRODUCTION In Quebec, Canada, receipt of the 2009 AS03-adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 vaccine was associated with increased risk of anaphylaxis and other allergic-like events (ALE), especially among women of childbearing age. In response to this safety signal, a case-control study was conducted to identify potential risk factors. METHODS A total of 435 ALE (50 anaphylaxis) occurring <24h following pandemic vaccination were compared to 849 age-gender matched controls randomly selected from the provincial Pandemic Influenza Vaccination Registry. More than 60 potential risk factors were evaluated through phone interviews and included demographic information, medical history, medication use or acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) concurrent with vaccination and other risk factors associated with general allergy. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals were estimated with unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS Factors associated with increased risk of anaphylaxis included concurrent ARI (18% cases vs. 4% controls, ORadj 7.67, 95%CI: 3.04-13.37), food allergy (26% cases vs. 4% controls, ORadj 3.84, 95%CI: 1.51-9.74) and vaccination during the first four weeks of the campaign (66% cases vs. 50% controls, ORadj 2.16, 95%CI: 1.10-4.25) whereas alcohol exposure (≥1 drink/week) was associated with reduced risk (29% cases vs. 42% controls, ORadj 0.26, 95%CI: 0.13-0.57). These factors were also significantly associated with any ALE but the strength of association was weaker. Allergy to components found in the vaccine (e.g., egg, thimerosal) was infrequent and did not significantly differ between cases and controls. CONCLUSION Increased anaphylaxis and other allergic-like events observed in association with AS03-adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 vaccine remain mostly unexplained despite extensive risk factor review. However, prior to mass vaccination with similar formulations this safety signal warrants further consideration and better understanding. In particular, the predominance among women of childbearing age may be a clue to underlying biological or hormonal influences on adverse immunological responses to vaccine.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3551,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0025212683,0
24794034,"Characterization of family D DNA polymerase from Thermococcus sp. 9°N. INTRODUCTION. Replicative DNA polymerases have evolved to faithfully replicate and maintain genomes to ensure accurate transmission of genetic information. Most DNA polymerases can be classified into families A, B, C and Y according to amino acid sequence similarity to Escherichia coli DNA polymerases I, II, III, and IV/V, respectively (Braithwaite and Ito 1993). Eukaryotic DNA polymerases β, λ, μ and terminal transferases comprise family X (Yamtich and Sweasy 2010). Heterodimeric family D DNA polymerases (polD) are unique to archaea and were initially characterized in several Pyrococcus species [(Ishino and Ishino 2012) and references therein]. PolD is a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of small (polD-S) and large (polD-L) subunits (Ishino et al. 1998; Cann et al. 1998), together referred to hereafter as polD. PolD possesses both 3′–5′ exonuclease and polymerase activities (Tang et al. 2004; Shen et al. 2003, 2004a, b; Henneke 2012). PolD-S contains a MRE11-like 3′–5′ exonuclease active site and shares limited sequence similarity with several of the small, non-catalytic subunits of the eukaryotic Polδ and Polε (Shen et al. 2004b). A three-dimensional structure of Pyrococcus horikoshii (Pho) polD-S N-terminal fragment (1–70 amino acids) shows structural homology to the N-terminal region of B subunits of human DNA Polα and Polε (Yamasaki et al. 2010). Pho polD-L contains amino acids important for polymerase activity and shares sequence similarity with the catalytic subunit of the eukaryotic Polε (Shen et al. 2001; Henneke et al. 2005). The three-dimensional structure of the Pho polD-L N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–300) was solved and reported as essential for protein folding and dimerization (Matsui et al. 2011). In addition, a subset of polD-L contains inteins inserted in conserved amino acid motifs that are spliced during maturation (Perler 2002). PolD has been proposed as a key replicase in archaea genome replication (Li et al. 2013). Similar to eukarya, a model of archaeal replication proposes that specialized polymerases complete leading [Family B DNA polymerase (polB)] and lagging (polD) strand synthesis (Li et al. 2013). Supporting this model, both polB and polD are required for viability in the archaeon I sp. NRC-1 (Berquist et al. 2007). However, recent gene deletion studies in Thermococcus kodakarensis (Tko) and Methanococcus maripaludis (Mma) demonstrate that only polD is required for viability and may be the only replicative DNA polymerase required to replicate both the leading and lagging strand (Sarmiento et al. 2013; Cubonova et al. 2013). Supporting its essential role in DNA replication, in vivo polD forms complexes with several replication proteins including mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase, DNA ligase, the archaeal Cdc45 protein and the processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Motz et al. 2002; Li et al. 2010, 2011; Kuba et al. 2012). Despite its proposed essential role in archaeal DNA replication in general and in Tko replication in particular, poor recombinant expression and low solubility have limited study of polD (Jokela et al. 2005). As an alternative to Tko polD, the polD from a closely related organism, Thermococcus species 9°N (9°N) was characterized in this study. 9°N was isolated from scrapings of a smoker chimney collected at the 9°N East Pacific Rise vent site, 500 miles south of Acapulco, Mexico at a depth of 2,500 m (Southworth et al. 1996). 9°N polB has been extensively studied (Southworth et al. 1996; Rodriguez et al. 2000) but the essential properties of 9°N polD are not known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate polD biochemical requirements for polymerization, 3′–5′ exonuclease, and incorporation fidelity. MATERIALS AND METHODS. ENZYMES. All restriction endonucleases, modifying enzymes, polB [9°Nm DNA polymerase; 9°N/E143D (Southworth et al. 1996)], Gibson Assembly mix, nucleotides, DNA ladders, and expression vectors were from New England Biolabs (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). POLD CLONING AND EXPRESSION. Based on the Thermococcus species 9°N genome sequence (data not shown), PCR primers were designed to PCR amplify the polD small and large subunits from genomic DNA (Southworth et al. 1996). To clone by Gibson Assembly (Gibson 2011), sequence overlapping with the cloning vector ends was added to each 5′ end of the forward and reverse PCR primers. PolD-S PCR primers were: polD-S forward: 5′-CTTTAAGAAG GAGATATACA TATGCTGATT GAGGATTTAA TC-3′ and polD-S reverse: 5′-CGGGCTTTGT TAGCAGCCGG TCAAACCCCC TCACAGAACT G-3; (vector sequence for Gibson Assembly is underlined). PolD-L PCR primers were: polD-L forward: 5′-CTTTAAGAAG GAGATATACA TATGGGGGAA GAGCTCTACT CA-3′ and polD-L reverse: 5′-CGGGCTTTGT TAGCAGCCGG CTAACTCCCG AAGAACTCGT C-3′ (vector sequence for Gibson Assembly is underlined). PolD-S and polD-L PCR products were cloned into NdeI and BamHI cleaved vector pAII17 (Perler et al. 1992) by Gibson assembly following the manufacturer’s protocol (New England Biolabs). PolD-S and polD-L gene sequences were verified by DNA sequencing resulting in plasmids pERE1 (polD-S) and pERF5 (polD-L). RECOMBINANT POLD PURIFICATION. For polD-S and polD-L expression and purification, NEB T7 Express/pRIL E. coli was transformed with either plasmid pERE1 or pERF5. One liter of LB media (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl, 1 g dextrose, 1 g MgCl2 per liter, pH adjusted to 7.2) containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin was co-inoculated with a single NEB T7 Express/pRIL E. coli/pERE1 colony and a single NEB T7 Express/pRIL E. coli pERF5 colony and grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.5), whereupon protein expression was induced by addition of 0.4 mM β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).

BACKGROUND Numerous population-based longitudinal studies suggest an association between modifiable lifestyle factors and late-life dementia. A comprehensive description of these factors and their quantification criteria is an important preliminary step toward the elucidation of causes and mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of dementia. OBJECTIVE To present a systematic review of modifiable lifestyle factors associated with dementia risk in longitudinal observational cohort-studies. METHODS A systematic review of original articles, published in English until December 2013, listed in four electronic databases (including PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO) was conducted. RESULTS 75 papers from 33 epidemiologic studies met the inclusion criteria. Included papers focused on dietary habits (n = 26), leisure activities (social, physical, mental) (n = 23), beverages (juice, tea, coffee, alcohol) (n = 15), smoking (n = 13), social network (n = 6), and combined lifestyle factors (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS Broad consensus emerged on the protective role against dementia of leisure activities. Conflicting results were found for the association between dementia and putative risk factors (smoking) and protective factors (mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption, dietary antioxidants, Mediterranean diet, and living with others). However, studies varied largely in the quantification of lifestyle factors in terms of intensity, frequency and duration of exposure, and in the choice of confounders in statistical analyses. The need for standardized quantification criteria emerges, together with the current limitation in reliably tracking the past history of each patient, from childhood and young adulthood to midlife.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3554,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0027900375,0

24824780,"MCC inhibits beta-catenin transcriptional activity by sequestering DBC1 in the cytoplasm. The mutated in colorectal cancer (MCC) is a multifunctional gene showing loss of expression in colorectal and liver cancers. MCC mutations can drive colon carcinogenesis in the mouse and in vitro experiments suggest that loss of MCC function promotes cancer through several important cellular pathways. In particular, the MCC protein is known to regulate beta-catenin (β-cat) signaling, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here we show that the β-cat repressor function of MCC is strongly impaired by the presence of a disease-associated mutation. We also identify deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) as a new MCC interacting partner and regulator of β-cat signaling. RNA interference experiments show that DBC1 promotes β-cat transcriptional activity and that the presence of DBC1 is required for MCC-mediated β-cat repression. In contrast to all other DBC1 interacting partners, MCC does not interact through the DBC1 Leucine Zipper domain but with a glutamic-acid rich region located between the Nudix and EF-hand domains. Furthermore, MCC overexpression relocalizes DBC1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and reduces β-cat K49 acetylation. Treatment of cells with the SIRT1 inhibitor Nicotinamide reverses MCC-induced deacetylation of β-cat K49. These data suggest that the cytoplasmic MCC-DBC1 interaction sequesters DBC1 away from the nucleus, thereby removing a brake on DBC1 nuclear targets, such as SIRT1. This study provides new mechanistic insights into the DBC1-MCC axis as a new APC independent β-cat inhibitory pathway.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3570,pos_MEDLINE,0.98942953,1

In order to evaluate antimicrobial properties of films Aspergillus niger was used. The results showed that 5% of the PS did not produce antimicrobial property in the film, but by increasing the content of the additive in film formulation, antimicrobial effect increased. PS increased water permeability and elongation at break of the films, but decreased tensile strength.

24909783,"Influence of domain interactions on conformational mobility of the progesterone receptor detected by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. The progesterone receptor (PR) is the cognate steroid receptor (SR) for the hormone progesterone belonging to the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily. This receptor plays a pivotal role in a range of biological functions including development and maintenance of female reproductive tissue (Anderson and Clarke, 2004; Graham and Clarke, 1997; Li and O’Malley, 2003; Obr and Edwards, 2012). There are two major isoforms of PR, PR-A and PR-B, with the latter having extra 164 amino acids at the N-terminus. For a majority of PR target genes, PR-B is a more potent transcriptional activator as compared to PR-A (Tung et al., 1993; Vegeto et al., 1993). The functional differences and tissue specificity of both isoforms are evident from knockout studies in mice (Fernandez-Valdivia et al., 2005). It has been reported that in breast cancer cells the majority of PR target genes are regulated by the B isoform (Mote et al., 1999; Mote et al., 2002; Richer et al., 2002). Steroid NRs are multi-domain proteins containing an; N-terminal domain (NTD), DNA binding domain (DBD), hinge region, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). Both the LBD and DBD of PR and other SRs are globular in nature and they have been well studied by a wide range of structural techniques. Moreover, several co-crystal structures of ligand-bound LBD in complex with coregulatory peptides have been solved (Bledsoe et al., 2002; Brzozowski et al., 1997; Madauss et al., 2007; Raaijmakers et al., 2009; Shiau et al., 1998; Williams and Sigler, 1998). Typical of SRs, PR consists of an unusually large intrinsically disordered (ID) NTD that comprises nearly half of the receptor. PR contains two activation function domains (AF1 and AF2) that provide interaction surfaces for transcriptional coregulatory proteins to bind. The N-terminal AF1 is ligand-independent whereas the C-terminal AF2 is ligand-dependent. Unfortunately, no high resolution structures of full length SRs have been reported, partly due to the highly disordered nature of their NTDs (Hill et al., 2012; Khan et al., 2012; Kumar and McEwan, 2012; Kumar and Thompson, 2012; McEwan et al., 2007). Thus, efforts to develop steroid receptor modulators (SRMs) for endocrine-based therapies have been mostly based on their ability to modulate AF2/LBD surfaces for coregulatory protein interactions, thus neglecting the AF1/NTD despite the fact that this region of SRs contribute significantly to the transcriptional activity of these receptors. Despite the lack of defined structure, ID regions of proteins are known to play important roles in molecular recognition and assembly formations. They carry out functions through a process called coupled binding and folding where upon interaction with its target binding partner, the ID protein or region undergoes a disorder-ordered transition (Dyson and Wright, 2002; Wright and Dyson, 2009). Consistent with this, a core C-terminal domain of the transcription factor TBP (TBPc, aa 159-339) has been reported to bind and fold the AF1/NTD regions of several SRs by promoting the ordered structure formation that facilitates AF1-mediated activity(Khan et al., 2011; Kumar et al., 2004; Kumar et al., 2013; Warnmark et al., 2001). In a recent report, we demonstrated a subregion of PR AF1/NTD (aa 350-428) is required for TBPc binding and TBPc dependent PR transcriptional activation (Kumar et al., 2013). However, these previous studies have examined the influence TBP on structure and folding of isolated NTDs and thus do not account for mechanisms and potential conformational flexibility associated with interdomain interactions of full-length receptors. It has been suggested that SRs are dynamic ensembles of structures responding to a variety of target molecules via synergistic actions of AF1 and AF2. Both the AFs are regulated through allosteric coupling to produce differential selection and/or activation of gene expression (Billas and Moras, 2013; Hilser and Thompson, 2011). However, direct detection of coordinated actions of AF1 and AF2 to bring about synergistic effects on gene activation remains elusive (Tetel et al., 1999; Tung et al., 2006). Since AF1/NTDs have eluded crystallization and no high resolution structures have been obtained of intact SRs, several groups have applied solution phase techniques to study SR structures including the use of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). HDX-MS has emerged as a powerful technique to characterize conformational flexibility associated with protein-protein or protein-ligand interaction in solution state (Chalmers et al., 2006; Englander, 2006; Konermann et al., 2011; Landgraf et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). HDX-MS has advantages for large molecular proteins such as SRs since it is not limited by protein size and can localize changes in conformational flexibility to specific sequences. This technique has been used previously to characterize NRs’ interaction with other binding partners and small molecule dependent activation mechanisms (Chalmers et al., 2011; Dai et al., 2009; Devarakonda et al., 2011; Goswami et al., 2013; Harms et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2011). Here we report the use of HDX-MS to provide an analysis of the solution state flexibility of full length PR-A and PR-B and the conformational ensemble of PR upon binding the co-regulatory protein TBP and hormonal agonist and antagonist ligands. These studies demonstrate that although TBP directly binds PR through AF1/NTD, conformational rearrangements in the intact PR involve both AF1/NTD and AF2/LBD indicating intramolecular interdomain interactions. Changes in structural flexibility in regions of TBP were also observed upon interaction with PR- NTD/AF1 indicating the potential of the NTD/AF1 to modulate conformation and activity of co-regulatory proteins.

This paper examines whether involvement in an observational study may prompt participants to change their exercise behaviors. Data were collected from 394 older community dwellers in Victoria, Australia using a baseline survey, and 245 of these participated in a follow-up survey one year later. Survey domains were drawn from constructs of relevant health behavior models. Results showed that the proportion of respondents who were currently participating in exercises to prevent falls at follow-up was 12% higher than at baseline (Wilcoxon p value < .001). Twenty-nine percent reported they had changed their perceptions about falls and their risk of falls, with comments focused on threat appraisal. Forty-four percent reported having taken strategies to reduce their risk of falling, with comments based on implementation of different preventive strategies. Respondents who held favorable views toward exercises for the prevention of falls appear to change their behaviors that might address falls when participating in observational studies.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3593,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0024822769,0
24997741,"Current treatment of psoriatic arthritis: update based on a systematic literature review to establish French Society for Rheumatology (SFR) recommendations for managing spondyloarthritis. OBJECTIVE The latest recommendations on managing psoriatic arthritis (PsA) were issued in 2007 by the French Society for Rheumatology (SFR) and in 2012 by the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR). A panel of spondyloarthritis experts developed new recommendations on the management of spondyloarthritides, including PsA, based on a literature review and expert opinion. METHODS The relevant literature published between December 1, 2009 and March 31, 2013 was reviewed by searching Medline; Embase; the Cochrane database; abstracts from meetings held by the SFR, EULAR, and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) between 2010 and 2012; and the therapeutic trials registered on http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. RESULTS No studies assessed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or glucocorticoids (given systemically or intraarticularly) in PsA. The efficacy of methotrexate was evaluated versus a placebo in the randomized MIPA trial. TNFα antagonists (the soluble receptor etanercept, chimeric monoclonal antibody [mAb] infliximab, humanized mAbs adalimumab and golimumab, and PEGylated mAb certolizumab) are the reference-standard biotherapies in PsA. The treat-to-target approach should be used, with the target being a remission or minimal disease activity. Registry data leave room for controversy about the potential benefits of combining methotrexate and a TNFα antagonist. Switching to an alternative TNFα antagonist when the first drug fails is effective, although the initial response and drug continuation rate may be decreased. New drugs such as apremilast and ustekinumab are being developed.

Replication-dependent histone mRNAs end with a conserved stem loop that is recognized by stem-loop-binding protein (SLBP). The minimal RNA-processing domain of SLBP is phosphorylated at an internal threonine, and Drosophila SLBP (dSLBP) also is phosphorylated at four serines in its 18-aa C-terminal tail. We show that phosphorylation of dSLBP increases RNA-binding affinity dramatically, and we use structural and biophysical analyses of dSLBP and a crystal structure of human SLBP phosphorylated on the internal threonine to understand the striking improvement in RNA binding. Together these results suggest that, although the C-terminal tail of dSLBP does not contact the RNA, phosphorylation of the tail promotes SLBP conformations competent for RNA binding and thereby appears to reduce the entropic penalty for the association. Increased negative charge in this C-terminal tail balances positively charged residues, allowing a more compact ensemble of structures in the absence of RNA.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3616,pos_MEDLINE,0.9979888,1

OBJECTIVE To detect factors that are associated with meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) among deliveries of small for gestational age (SGA) neonates and to identify perinatal outcomes of deliveries of SGA infants complicated with MSAF. METHODS A population-based study comparing deliveries of SGA neonates with and without MSAF was conducted. Deliveries occurred during the years 1988-2007 at the Soroka University Medical Center. Risk factors for MSAF among SGA infants were evaluated. Incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes were compared between deliveries of SGA neonates with and without MSAF. RESULTS During the study period 9583 deliveries were of SGA neonates. Of these, 16.6% (n = 1597) were complicated with MSAF. Among SGA neonates, older maternal age, multiparty, lack of prenatal care and weight were significantly associated with MSAF. Having delivered an SGA infant with MSAF was associated with decreased rates of induction of labor and increased rates of labor dystocia, delivery by cesarean section and fetal distress. Using multivariable regression models, having delivered an SGA infant with MSAF was independently associated with fetal distress.

25013172,"Phospho-dependent and phospho-independent interactions of the helicase UPF1 with the NMD factors SMG5-SMG7 and SMG6. INTRODUCTION. The degradation of eukaryotic mRNAs is an important mechanism in the regulation of gene expression. It allows the cell to rapidly change protein expression levels in response to intracellular or extracellular signals. In addition, mRNA decay pathways serve to maintain the fidelity of gene expression by targeting aberrant transcripts that would otherwise give rise to unphysiological and potentially deleterious protein products [reviewed in (1,2)]. A well-known example is nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which detects and degrades mRNA transcripts containing a premature termination codon (PTC) [reviewed in (3–6)]. PTCs arise from errors in transcription and RNA processing, and from mutations in the genome. Additionally, NMD also regulates the levels of diverse cellular mRNAs, accounting for ∼5–10% of the transcriptome [reviewed in (7)]. The NMD pathway was originally discovered in yeast (8) and operates in all eukaryotes studied to date [reviewed in (9,10)]. The prevailing model of NMD postulates that a ribosome stalled at a PTC terminates translation in an aberrant manner due to adjacent cis-acting elements that are not present in the context of normal termination, leading to the assembly of trans-acting NMD factors that prompt the degradation of the PTC-mRNA [reviewed in (6,11–14)]. The predominant and best-characterized cis-acting element is the mammalian exon junction complex (EJC), a ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) that assembles on the open-reading frame of spliced mRNAs (15). If present downstream of a PTC, the EJC acts in synergy with the stalled ribosome to recruit NMD factors. In humans, several NMD factors have been identified to date (SMG1-SMG9, DHX34 and NAG/NBAS). Of these, SMG1–SMG7 were first isolated in Caenorhabditis elegans and named after the original mutant phenotypes (suppressor with morphogenic effect on genitalia) (16–21). More recently, a genome-wide RNA interference screen in C. elegans led to the identification of the two new NMD genes, smgl-1 and smgl-2, that encode for the proteins NAG/NBAS and DHX34 (22). Finally, the proteins SMG8 and SMG9 were characterized in humans as regulatory co-factors of the protein kinase SMG1 (23). The core of the NMD machinery comprises the three up-frameshift proteins UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3 (corresponding to SMG2, SMG3 and SMG4), which are conserved from yeast to humans (24–26). UPF1 is an RNA helicase essential for NMD (17,20,27,28). The catalytic activity of UPF1 is stimulated upon formation of the UPF1–UPF2–UPF3 (UPF) complex (29) and is thought to remodel the PTC-mRNA (30). In mammals, the UPF complex also binds directly to the EJC (29,31–33) and impacts on UPF1 phosphorylation (34). The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycle of UPF1 is essential for NMD in metazoans (18,35). UPF1 is phosphorylated by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinase SMG1 (18,21,36–39). SMG1 associates with two co-factors, SMG8 and SMG9 (23,40) and with the ribosome release factors eRF1 and eRF3 (34). In turn, phosphorylated UPF1 recruits SMG5, SMG6 and SMG7. These three proteins share a phosphoserine-binding domain similar to that found in 14–3–3 proteins (41). SMG5 and SMG7 form a stable heterodimer that binds phosphorylated residues in the C-terminus of UPF1 (38,42). SMG5 and SMG7 also mediate UPF1 dephosphorylation (18,35) and target the PTC-mRNA to sites of 5′–3′ RNA degradation known as P bodies (43). SMG6 is not part of the SMG5–SMG7 complex (35,43,44) and has distinct functional modules: it contains two EJC-binding motifs or EBMs (45) and harbors an endonuclease activity that cleaves the PTC-mRNA in proximity of the ribosome (46–48). SMG6 has been shown to bind the phosphorylated N-terminus of UPF1 in co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays (38), but contradictory data from tethering assays have shown that the N-terminus of UPF1 is dispensable (42). Elucidating the macromolecular interactions between phosphorylated UPF1 and the downstream SMG5–SMG7 and SMG6 factors is an important step toward understanding the mechanisms that bring about NMD. We set out to recapitulate the interactions in vitro using the available knowledge from co-IP studies with endogenous proteins. To this end, we reconstituted in vitro phosphorylated UPF1 and used it in biochemical assays. We show that SMG6 differs substantially from SMG5–SMG7 in the way it recognizes UPF1. We solved the crystal structure of the SMG6 TPR domain and elucidate the structural basis for the differences in the functions of SMG6 and SMG5–SMG7. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. His- and His-GST tagged SMG6 TPR were expressed using Escherichia coli BL21-Gold (DE3) pLysS cells (Stratagene) grown in TB medium and induced overnight at 18°C. The cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 200 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors (Roche). The proteins were purified by Ni2+- affinity chromatography as an initial step and further purified over a HiTrap Q Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare) to remove minor contaminants.

The complex crystallized as a dimer of complexes, with the conserved Nef PXXPXR motif engaging the Hck SH3 domain. A new intercomplex contact was found between SH3 Glu-93, and Nef Arg-105. Mutagenesis of Hck SH3 Glu-93 interfered with Nef·Hck complex formation and kinase activation in cells.

BACKGROUND Iatrogenic pharyngoesophageal perforations are a rare but serious complication of endoscopy. Surgical and non-surgical approaches have been reported but result in a significant morbidity and extended hospital stay. Therefore, an unmet need exists for an alternative management technique. We demonstrate a new endoscopic approach for the management of iatrogenic pharyngoesophageal perforations through the use of esophageal fully covered self-expandable metallic stents (FCSEMS). PATIENTS AND METHODS Two patients who underwent flexible endoscopy each suffered a large iatrogenic perforation detected intraprocedurally. After emergency intubation, an esophageal FCSEMS was deployed in the hypopharynx and the patient admitted to the intensive care unit. On day 3, the patients underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy with stent removal. RESULTS There was complete closure of the perforations on day 3. The patients were extubated and subsequently tolerated a soft diet. The patients were discharged home on day 4.

25160619,"Molecular basis of kindlin-2 binding to integrin-linked kinase pseudokinase for regulating cell adhesion. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a distinct intracellular adaptor essential for integrin-mediated cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, cell spreading, and migration. Acting as a major docking platform in focal adhesions, ILK engages many proteins to dynamically link integrins with the cytoskeleton, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we have characterized the interaction of ILK with kindlin-2, a key regulator for integrin bidirectional signaling. We show that human kindlin-2 binds to human ILK with high affinity. Using systematic mapping approaches, we have identified a major ILK binding site involving a 20-residue fragment (residues 339-358) in kindlin-2. NMR-based analysis reveals a helical conformation of this fragment that utilizes its leucine-rich surface to recognize the ILK pseudokinase domain in a mode that is distinct from another ILK pseudokinase domain binding protein, α-parvin. Structure-based mutational experiments further demonstrate that the kindlin-2 binding to ILK is crucial for the kindlin-2 localization to focal adhesions and cell spreading (integrin outside-in signaling) but dispensable for the kindlin-2-mediated integrin activation (integrin inside-out signaling). These data define a specific mode of the kindlin-2/ILK interaction with mechanistic implications as to how it spatiotemporally mediates integrin signaling and cell adhesion.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3651,pos_MEDLINE,0.997813,1

Salmonella infections are a leading cause of bacterial foodborne illness in the U.S.A. and the European Union Antimicrobial therapy is often administered to treat the infection, but increasingly isolates are being detected that demonstrate resistance to multiple antibiotics. Salmonella enterica contains two virulence-related T3SS (type III secretion systems): one promotes invasion of the intestine and the other one mediates systemic disease. Both of them secrete the SlrP protein acting as E3 ubiquitin ligase in human host cells where it targets Trx1 (thioredoxin-1). SlrP belongs to the NEL family of bacterial E3 ubiquitin ligases that have been observed in two distinct autoinhibitory conformations. We solved the 3D structure of the SlrP-Trx1 complex and determined the Trx1 ubiquitination site. The description of the substrate-binding mode sheds light on the first step of the activation mechanism of SlrP. Comparison with the available structural data of other NEL effectors allowed us to gain new insights into their autoinhibitory mechanism. We propose a molecular mechanism for the regulation of SlrP in which structural constraints sequestrating the NEL domain would be sequentially released. This work thus constitutes a new milestone in the understanding of how these T3SS effectors influence pathogen virulence.

25285205,"Thiolation-enhanced substrate recognition by D-alanyl carrier protein ligase DltA from Bacillus cereus. INTRODUCTION. The cell surface of most Gram-positive bacteria contains wall teichoic acid and lipoteichoic acid with a poly-alditol phosphate backbone. The remaining hydroxyls of the alditol moiety are ubiquitously modified by D-alanyl esterification or glycosylation . A dlt operon, which typically codes for DltA, DltB, DltC and DltD proteins, is required for the D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acids . D-alanylation brings in positively charged amino-groups and partially neutralizes the net negative charges of the phosphate groups on the lipoteichoic acid backbone. The reduction of D-alanyl content on the cell surface has been found to be associated with increased autolysis and susceptibility to host defense peptides and other antibiotics . Impaired D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid also reduces the ability of bacteria to colonize any surface and form antibiotics-resistant biofilms . Therefore, the dlt-encoded proteins required for the lipoteichoic acid D-alanylation pathway could serve as novel targets for fighting emerging infectious diseases caused by Gram-positive pathogens . The DltA inhibitor 5’-O-[N-(D-alanyl)-sulfamoyl]adenosine for example, designed by analogy to D-alanyl adenylate (D-Ala-AMP), has been shown to significantly suppress the growth of B. subtilis when used in combination with vancomycin . The D-alanyl carrier protein ligase DltA (formed by ~500 amino acid residues) closely resembles (~30% sequence identity) the adenylation domains (also called adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-forming domains) found in bacterial non-ribosomal peptide synthetases . Its remote homologs include the acyl- and aryl-(coenzyme A) CoA synthetases and firefly luciferases . As shown in Figure 1, DltA catalyzes the ATP-driven adenylation of D-alanine and the subsequent transfer of the activated D-alanyl group to the thiol group of 4’-phosphopantetheine, which is covalently bound to a serine side chain of D-alanyl carrier protein DltC (~80 amino acid residues) . As previously shown for such one-protein-two-enzymes homologs , crystal structures of two DltA proteins have also been observed in adenylation and thiolation conformations, respectively ( Figure 1). The thiolation conformation of B. subtilis DltA (BsDltA) resembles previously determined structures of a bacterial acetate-CoA synthetase (ACS) and 4-chlorobenzoate-CoA ligase crystallized in their respective thiolation state . On the other hand, the adenylation conformation of B. cereus DltA (BcDltA) resembles those observed in the crystal structures of the firefly luciferase PheA (phenylalanine-activating domain of the first module of the Bacillus brevis gramicidin S synthetase I), DhbE (2,3-dihydroxybenzoate activation domain from B. subtilis), a yeast acetyl-CoA synthetase and 4-chlorobenzoate-CoA ligase . The two conformations captured in the crystal structures of the two closely related DltA proteins (56% sequence identity) are related by a ~146º rotation around a hinge residue Asp-399 in BcDltA (Asp-398 in BsDltA), which is a invariable residue equivalent to Asp-517 in Salmonella typhimurium acetyl-CoA synthetase . The region surrounding this hinge residue (residues Arg-397 to Glu-413 of BcDltA green in Figure 1B) contains an important triphosphate-interacting residue Arg-397 and a β-hairpin which serves as part of the pantetheine channel as observed in the bacterial acetyl-CoA synthetase . We previously studied the adenylation reaction of BcDltA in the absence of any D-alanyl carrier to enable the thiolation reaction . The resulting specificity constants (k cat/K M) for D- and L-alanine differed by merely ~3-fold, which could not explain the fact that teichoic acid is overwhelmingly modified by D- but not L-alanine . As suggested by a study on a spectrum of DltA homologs which have residual aminoacyl-CoA synthetase activity , CoA has been confirmed to be a substitute for the D-alanyl carrier protein DltC as the thiolation substrate of BcDltA . Here we report further biochemical analysis of BcDltA. Noticeable differences were observed in Michaelis constants K M and turnover rates k cat. The presence of CoA, hence the enabled adenylation and thiolation cycle, enhanced the enzyme’s apparent affinities to its cognitive substrate ATP and D-alanine by approximately an order of magnitude. Since BcDltA is a slow enzyme with turnover rate less than 1 s -1, much slower than bacterial Acyl-CoA synthetases (~10 2 s -1) and 4-chlorobenzoate-CoA ligase (~10 s -1) , the observed Michaelis constants should closely approximate the corresponding dissociation constants, and therefore provide some insight into the stability of short-lived enzyme-substrate complexes. We also determined the structure of BcDltA in the absence of any substrate. This structure is noticeably more disordered than previously reported DltA structures , which may explain the enzyme’s lower affinity to ATP in the absence of the other two substrates. Interestingly, CoA-enhanced affinities to ATP and D-alanine imply that the thiolation substrate CoA-bound BcDltA has higher affinity to both adenylation substrates as compared to CoA-free BcDltA. METHODS. CLONING, PROTEIN PREPARATION AND CRYSTALLIZATION. All reagents were from VWR unless specified otherwise. The wild-type as well as the C269A mutant of DltA from B. cereus was cloned for over-expression of BcDltA as described previously . The pET28-BcDltA construct carries an Ala-1 mutation at the N-terminus and eight extra residues at the C-terminus (LEHHHHHH). The soluble fraction of BcDltA was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. BcDltA was concentrated to ~20 mg/mL by ultra-filtration.

25306921,"Dss1 is a 26S proteasome ubiquitin receptor. SUMMARY. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. Proteins to be degraded are conjugated to ubiquitin chains that act as recognition signals for the 26S proteasome. The proteasome subunits Rpn10 and Rpn13 are known to bind ubiquitin, but genetic and biochemical data suggest the existence of at least one other substrate receptor. Here, we show that the phylogenetically conserved proteasome subunit Dss1 (Sem1) binds ubiquitin chains linked by K63 and K48. Atomic resolution data show that Dss1 is disordered and binds ubiquitin by binding sites characterized by acidic and hydrophobic residues. The complementary binding region in ubiquitin is composed of a hydrophobic patch formed by I13, I44, and L69 flanked by two basic regions. Mutations in the ubiquitin-binding site of Dss1 cause growth defects and accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins. INTRODUCTION. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the major pathway for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells, regulating most cellular processes, including cell division, signal transduction, and development (Finley, 2009). Before degradation, proteins are conjugated to ubiquitin chains that act as recognition signals for the 26S proteasome, a large proteolytic complex that degrades substrate proteins (Finley, 2009). Although proteasome function has been extensively studied, our knowledge of how this particle recognizes ubiquitylated substrates remains incomplete. Since the identification of the first intrinsic proteasomal ubiquitin receptor, Rpn10, studies have identified a group of so-called UBL-UBA domain proteins that act as transient, extrinsic proteasome substrate receptors (Deveraux et al., 1994, Seeger et al., 2003, Su and Lau, 2009, Wilkinson et al., 2001). More recently, an additional novel intrinsic receptor, Rpn13, was identified (Husnjak et al., 2008, Schreiner et al., 2008). However, budding yeast cells, deleted for the UBL-UBA domain proteins and mutated in both the Rpn10 and Rpn13 ubiquitin-interacting regions, are still viable (Husnjak et al., 2008). Moreover, ubiquitin conjugates still bind to 26S proteasomes lacking the ubiquitin-interacting regions of Rpn10 and Rpn13 (Peth et al., 2010). As proteasome function is essential, at least one additional ubiquitin receptor remains to be discovered (Saeki and Tanaka, 2008). Here, we present structural, biochemical, and genetic data that the disordered and multifunctional protein Dss1 (known as Sem1 in budding yeast), is another ubiquitin-binding subunit of the 26S proteasome. RESULTS. UBIQUITIN BINDING TO RPN10 IS NOT ESSENTIAL FOR VIABILITY. In fission yeast, substrate recognition by the 26S proteasome is accomplished by two intrinsic proteasome subunits, Rpn10 and Rpn13, and two extrinsic UBL-UBA domain proteasome cofactors, Rhp23 and Dph1 (Finley, 2009, Hartmann-Petersen et al., 2003, Sakata et al., 2012, Wilkinson et al., 2001) (Figure 1A). Studies have shown these receptors to be functionally redundant (Husnjak et al., 2008, Peth et al., 2010, Wilkinson et al., 2001). It was previously demonstrated, both in budding and fission yeast, that the gene for the UBL-UBA domain protein Rad23 (Rhp23 in fission yeast) functionally overlapped with the gene encoding the 26S proteasome ubiquitin receptor subunit Rpn10. Specifically, only a double deletion mutant (rpn10Δrhp23Δ) displayed severe growth defects (Wilkinson et al., 2001). In addition, Rhp23 variants unable to bind ubiquitin or the proteasome could not rescue the growth defects of the double mutant, implying that substrate recognition was at least partly responsible for the observed phenotypes (Wilkinson et al., 2001). Therefore, we asked whether lack of the ubiquitin- or proteasome-binding functions of Rpn10 contribute to the severe phenotype of the rpn10Δrhp23Δ double mutant. To this end, we cloned constructs of rpn10 that lacked the ubiquitin interaction motif (UIM), Rpn10ΔUIM, or the N-terminal proteasome-binding region, Rpn10ΔΝ82 (Figure 1B) (Seeger et al., 2003). The constructs were integrated into both rpn10Δ and rhp23Δ strains. These strains were then crossed, and the ability of the Rpn10 constructs to rescue the growth defects of the rpn10Δrhp23Δ double mutant were assayed by plating and selecting for the relevant spores. Surprisingly, this revealed that the Rpn10ΔUIM construct rescued the growth defects as efficiently as the full-length construct (Figure 1C; Figure S1A available online), while the Rpn10ΔΝ82 proteasome-binding mutant did not (Figure 1C). This implies that loss of Rpn10 ubiquitin binding does not contribute to the severe phenotype of the rpn10Δrhp23Δ double mutant. The fact that the rhp23Δrpn10ΔUIM mutant is viable is consistent with previous work, suggesting that the vWA domain has some unknown facilitator function in the UPS (Mayor et al., 2007, Peth et al., 2010, Verma et al., 2004) and shows that other proteasomal substrate receptors functionally overlap with Rpn10 and Rhp23. Currently, the remaining known receptors and shuttle proteins are the UBL-UBA protein Dsk2 (Dph1 in fission yeast) and Rpn13 (Rpn13a and Rpn13b in fission yeast) that associate with both ubiquitin and the proteasome. To test these candidates genetically, null mutants were constructed for each and subsequently crossed to create the appropriate genetic backgrounds. We postulated that, if either of these receptors functionally overlapped with Rpn10 and Rad23, then deletion of its gene in the rpn10Δrhp23Δ background should prevent rescue of the rpn10Δrhp23Δ phenotype by the Rpn10ΔUIM construct. Surprisingly, the Rpn10ΔUIM construct once again rescued the dph1Δrpn10Δrhp23Δ triple (Figure S1B) and rpn13aΔrpn13bΔrpn10Δrhp23Δ quadruple deletion mutants (Figure S1C). This implies that neither Dph1 nor Rpn13 were responsible for the rescue of the rpn10Δrhp23Δ growth defects by Rpn10ΔUIM. Therefore, we considered other candidates that could have yet uncharacterized substrate recognition",PMC,pos,1,pos,3685,pos_PMC,0.997851,1
25311844,"Application of nano-carbon in lymph node dissection for thyroid cancer and protection of parathyroid glands. BACKGROUND. Recently, the incidence of thyroid cancer has been increasing yearly, and lymph node metastasis can be found at an early stage [1]. Radical resection is still the best method of treatment because this disease is not sensitive to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Insufficient intraoperative lymph node dissection easily causes cancer residue or relapse after surgery, and reoperation is required, and the excessive dissection may result in damage to the parathyroid glands and surrounding organs. The rate of erroneous parathyroid gland dissection is up to 16.4%, and the incidence of permanent hypoparathyroidism after neck lymph node dissection for thyroid cancer is 4%. The occurrence of hypoparathyroidism not only greatly reduces the life quality to seriously affect the outcome of surgery in patients with thyroid cancer, but also increases the risk of medical disputes. Therefore, protection of parathyroid glands is attracting the attention of more and more surgeons. A new technology is urgently needed in clinics to effectively reduce the incidence of postoperative hypoparathyroidism. In this study, application of nano-carbon suspension in neck lymph node dissection for thyroid cancer caused development of lymph nodes and negative development of parathyroid glands, which is conductive to complete lymph node dissection, increases the detection rate of lymph nodes during surgery, effectively avoids parathyroid damage, and improves the intraoperative identification and protection of parathyroid glands, thereby greatly decreasing the risk of thyroid cancer surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS. CLINICAL DATA. One hundred patients with thyroid cancer were selected randomly from those who were treated from April 2012 to October 2013 in our hospital. All the patients were given total thyroidectomy combined with central neck lymph node dissection by the same surgeon. Fifty patients (5 males and 45 females, mean age: 36.4±2.5 (23–65) years) who received nano-carbon suspension during the operation were included in the experiment group and all were diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma pathologically. Fifty patients (11 males and 39 females, mean age: 44.5±5.8 (18–59) years) who did not use nano-carbon suspension were included in the control group, in which 46 cases were diagnosed with papillary carcinoma and 4 cases were diagnosed with follicular thyroid carcinoma pathologically. There were no statistically significant differences in age or sex between the 2 groups. Nano-carbon suspension was provided by Chongqing LUMMY Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Informed consent for all the materials and methods involved in the paper was obtained from the patients, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospital. PROCEDURES. All patients were given general anesthesia. The operation procedures were as follows: the heads of the patients were pulled back to expose the neck, and the neck suprasternal notch was identified as the bony landmark. A curved incision was made at the 2-finger distance above, and the skin flap was dissociated layer by layer to separate the thyroid gland and cervical anterior muscles, fully exposing the surgical site. In the experiment group, after the thyroid gland was exposed, nano-carbon suspension was injected into the thyroid gland from the top, middle, and lower point with a 1-mL syringe. About 0.2 mL of suspension was required per point and excessive volume was avoided by all means. Back-drawing should be performed while injecting to avoid mistakenly injecting into the blood vessel (Figure 1). The thyroid gland was gently pressed for 10 min until the gland was developed after completing injection (Figure 2). After 10–15 min, the lymph vessel and lymph node were developed (Figure 3), but parathyroid glands and recurrent laryngeal nerve were not developed (Figure 4). After exploring the thyroid gland of the affected side, removing the lobes with lesions, and conducting intraoperative frozen-section diagnosis, this condition was proved to be thyroid cancer. Afterwards, total thyroidectomy and central lymph node dissection of the affected side were performed. If preoperative biopsy confirmed that the condition was thyroid cancer, nano-carbon suspension was directly injected, and then total thyroidectomy and central lymph node dissection of the affected side were performed. In the control group, the thyroid gland of the affected side was directly explored and the lobes with lesions were removed. After the results of intraoperative frozen-section diagnosis of thyroid cancer, the operation methods were the same as those of the experimental group. In both groups, the surgical site was precise and anatomical position was detailed; moreover, the parathyroid glands were protected, and the operation was completed by the same group of surgeons. The scope of lymph node dissection was as follows: from the upper bound (the upper pole of the thyroid gland) to the lower bound (the suprasternal fossa), from the external bound (the inner edge of the common carotid artery) to the inner bound (the median line of the neck), and the base (the esophagus and prevertebral fascia). The recurrent laryngeal nerves were exposed and protected after anatomy (Figure 5). En bloc resection of lymph node and adipose tissues in this region was performed. After lymph node dissection, the retained parathyroid gland and recurrent laryngeal nerves can be displayed clearly (Figure 6). MONITORING STANDARD. The normal range of serum parathyroid hormone is 15–88 pg /ml, and <15pg /ml indicates hypoparathyroidism. The normal range of serum calcium is 2.08–2.80 mmol /L, and <2.08 mmol/L indicates hypocalcemia. If the serum parathyroid hormone at 3 months after surgery is still lower than this standard, the patient is considered to have permanent hypoparathyroidism. The clinical manifestations of hypoparathyroidism (e.g., tingling in the fingers and toes and around lips, tetany) were observed.

25349408,"p100/IκBδ sequesters and inhibits NF-κB through kappaBsome formation. Degradation of I kappaB (κB) inhibitors is critical to activation of dimeric transcription factors of the NF-κB family. There are two types of IκB inhibitors: the prototypical IκBs (IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε), which form low-molecular-weight (MW) IκB:NF-κB complexes that are highly stable, and the precursor IκBs (p105/IκBγ and p100/IκBδ), which form high-MW assemblies, thereby suppressing the activity of nearly half the cellular NF-κB [Savinova OV, Hoffmann A, Ghosh G (2009) Mol Cell 34(5):591-602]. The identity of these larger assemblies and their distinct roles in NF-κB inhibition are unknown. Using the X-ray crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of p100/IκBδ and functional analysis of structure-guided mutants, we show that p100/IκBδ forms high-MW (IκBδ)4:(NF-κB)4 complexes, referred to as kappaBsomes. These IκBδ-centric ""kappaBsomes"" are distinct from the 2:2 complexes formed by IκBγ. The stability of the IκBδ tetramer is enhanced upon association with NF-κB, and hence the high-MW assembly is essential for NF-κB inhibition. Furthermore, weakening of the IκBδ tetramer impairs both its association with NF-κB subunits and stimulus-dependent processing into p52. The unique ability of p100/IκBδ to stably interact with all NF-κB subunits by forming kappaBsomes demonstrates its importance in sequestering NF-κB subunits and releasing them as dictated by specific stimuli for developmental programs.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3698,pos_MEDLINE,0.9968945,1
25383530,"Structural insight into autoinhibition and histone H3-induced activation of DNMT3A. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that is essential for various developmental processes through regulating gene expression, genomic imprinting, and epigenetic inheritance. Mammalian genomic DNA methylation is established during embryogenesis by de novo DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, and the methylation patterns vary with developmental stages and cell types. DNA methyltransferase 3-like protein (DNMT3L) is a catalytically inactive paralogue of DNMT3 enzymes, which stimulates the enzymatic activity of Dnmt3a. Recent studies have established a connection between DNA methylation and histone modifications, and revealed a histone-guided mechanism for the establishment of DNA methylation. The ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain of Dnmt3a recognizes unmethylated histone H3 (H3K4me0). The histone H3 tail stimulates the enzymatic activity of Dnmt3a in vitro, whereas the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here we show that DNMT3A exists in an autoinhibitory form and that the histone H3 tail stimulates its activity in a DNMT3L-independent manner. We determine the crystal structures of DNMT3A-DNMT3L (autoinhibitory form) and DNMT3A-DNMT3L-H3 (active form) complexes at 3.82 and 2.90 Å resolution, respectively. Structural and biochemical analyses indicate that the ADD domain of DNMT3A interacts with and inhibits enzymatic activity of the catalytic domain (CD) through blocking its DNA-binding affinity. Histone H3 (but not H3K4me3) disrupts ADD-CD interaction, induces a large movement of the ADD domain, and thus releases the autoinhibition of DNMT3A. The finding adds another layer of regulation of DNA methylation to ensure that the enzyme is mainly activated at proper targeting loci when unmethylated H3K4 is present, and strongly supports a negative correlation between H3K4me3 and DNA methylation across the mammalian genome. Our study provides a new insight into an unexpected autoinhibition and histone H3-induced activation of the de novo DNA methyltransferase after its initial genomic positioning.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3707,pos_MEDLINE,0.99693066,1
25383667,"Structural determinants of integrin β-subunit specificity for latent TGF-β. Integrins are α-β heterodimers that connect diverse extracellular ligands to the cytoskeleton and regulate cell growth and differentiation. The primary function of most of the 24 vertebrate integrins is to mediate cell adhesion and migration; in contrast, integrins αVβ6 and αVβ8 are specialized to activate TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 (refs. 2,3). The similarity in phenotypes of mice deficient in TGF-β1 (ref. 4) to those of mice deficient in integrin αVβ6 (ref. 2) or αVβ8 (ref. 3) and to those of mice in which RGE in latent TGF-β1 (pro-TGF-β1) has replaced RGD demonstrates the importance of the RGD motif and integrins αVβ6 and αVβ8 in TGF-β1 activation in vivo. How integrins αVβ6 and αVβ8 achieve specificity, and how integrin β subunits in general contribute to ligand specificity, remain unclear. Little is known beyond mutational evidence for the importance of a disulfide-bonded loop (the β2-β3 loop) in the βI domain and the invariant binding of the metal ion–dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) to an acidic residue present in all integrin ligands. The issue of how the β subunit contributes specificity is particularly acute for the five RGD-recognizing integrins that contain the αV subunit and differ only in having the β1, β3, β5, β6 or β8 subunit. Here, we report the molecular mechanism by which αVβ6 achieves high specificity for the RGD peptide motif present in the prodomains of TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 and the determinants of specificity for integrin β subunits in general. RESULTS. PRO-TGF-Β1 ACTIVATION CORRELATES WITH HIGH INTEGRIN AFFINITY. Transfectants expressing αVβ6 and αVβ8 but not αV, cotransfected with the β1, β3 and β5 subunits, can activate pro-TGF-β (Fig. 1a), results in agreement with previous studies. In correlation with activation, αVβ6 and αVβ8, but not other αV integrin transfectants, strongly bound 50 nM fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled pro-TGF-β1 (Fig. 1b). Ligands bind to the integrin headpiece, which contains the α-subunit β-propeller domain and thigh domain as well as the β subunit βI, hybrid, PSI and EGF1 domains. There are no previous measurements of αVβ6 affinity for ligand despite the extensive characterization of specificity and comparison among TGF-β1, TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 and among integrins in adhesion and binding assays. αVβ6 can be affinity purified with both the TGF-β1 prodomain and fibronectin. Adhesion assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays have indicated stronger binding of αVβ6 than αVβ3 to pro-TGF-β1 and to pro-TGF-β3 and a lack of binding in the same assays to pro-TGF-β2 (refs. 2,12). We accurately measured the affinity of monomeric pro-TGF-β3 peptide GRGDLGRL for the αVβ6 and αVβ3 headpieces with fluorescence anisotropy, using either direct binding of FITC-labeled peptide or competition with unlabeled peptide. All measurements were with the physiologic cations Mg2+ and Ca2+. Nonapeptides containing RGD from pro-TGF-β1 and pro-TGF-β3 bound to αVβ6 with remarkably high affinity (10.3 and 8.5 nM, respectively; Fig. 1c). In contrast, the same peptides bound to αVβ3 with 1,000-fold-lower affinity (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, the homologous peptide from pro-TGF-β2, which has SGD in place of RGD, also bound to αVβ6 but with a 1,000-fold-lower affinity (8.5 µM) comparable to that of the GRGDSP peptide of fibronectin (2.5 µM; Fig. 1c). It is quite interesting that αVβ6 binds to pro-TGF-β2 peptide with an affinity that is in a range typically found for integrin binding to biological ligands. These results suggest that further investigation is warranted of a role for integrins, possibly distinct from that of αVβ6, in the activation of pro-TGF-β2. ΑVΒ6 CRYSTAL STRUCTURES. We turned to crystal structures to determine the basis for the unprecedented high affinity of αVβ6 for pro-TGF-β and its peptides. Crystals of the αVβ6 headpiece, with or without a pro-TGF-β3 undecapeptide soaked in, diffracted to 2.6 and 2.85 Å (Table 1), respectively, and contained two molecules per asymmetric unit, with almost identical structures. The headpiece adopts the closed headpiece conformation in the absence and presence of soaked ligand (Fig. 2a), i.e., with the hybrid domain swung in toward the α subunit and with the β1-α1 and β6-α7 loops and α7 helix in the βI domain in the closed conformation. Compared to those of β3, the βI and PSI domains of β6 are similar in structure, with greater differences in the hybrid domain (Supplementary Table 1). Three closely spaced metal ion–binding sites are present in the integrin βI domain: the synergistic metal ion–binding site (SyMBS), the MIDAS and the site adjacent to the MIDAS (ADMIDAS). αVβ6 crystallized at pH 6.5 loses its SyMBS metal ion; furthermore, the SyMBS-coordinating α2-α3 loop also remodels and invades the ligand-binding pocket (Fig. 2b). Remodeling enables SyMBS residues Asn218 and Asp220 to point outward and to form three strong, 2.4- to 2.7-Å hydrogen bonds in place of Ca2+ coordination (Fig. 2b). Similar remodeling of the β3-subunit α2-α3 loop in the absence of a SyMBS Ca2+ (refs. 13,15) is blocked by the large side chains of residues that characterize its ligand-binding pocket, especially β3 Arg214 and Tyr166 in place of β6 Ala217 and Lys170 (Fig. 2f–h). We hypothesized that crystallization at pH 4.5–6.5 might be responsible for variable loss of the SyMBS, MIDAS and/or ADMIDAS metal ions from αVβ3 (refs. 13,15) and αVβ6, in contrast to occupation of all three sites in αIIbβ3 crystalized at higher pH. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of pH on affinity of αVβ6 for the TGF-β3 nonapeptide. Indeed, fluorescence anisotropy demonstrated strong pH dependence with a particularly sharp decrease in affinity between pH 7 and pH 6 (Fig. 2c). Because many cells coexpress integrins with their ligands, including epithelial cells that coexpress αVβ6 and pro-TGF-β1, it is possible that this pH dependence may contribute to the inhibition of ligand binding during biosynthesis in the Golgi (pH 6.0–6.7) and transport in endosomes (pH 6.3–6",PMC,pos,1,pos,3708,pos_PMC,0.995488,1
25436519,"Intrinsic disorder drives N-terminal ubiquitination by Ube2w. INTRODUCTION. The attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) to cellular proteins is a highly regulated process that requires three enzyme activities. First, an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme forms a thioester bond between its active site cysteine and the Ub C-terminus in an ATP-dependent reaction. Second, Ub undergoes a transthiolation reaction with the active site cysteine of an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme forming an E2~Ub conjugate. Third, E2~Ub interacts with an E3 ubiquitin ligase to modify protein targets via a RING-type, HECT-type, or RING-between-RING-type (RBR-type) mechanism. A distinguishing feature of RING-type mechanisms is that the E3 activates the E2~Ub conjugate to transfer Ub directly from the E2 active site to the substrate. Thus, in RING-type mechanisms, the E2 plays a direct role in interacting with substrate and dictating the final ubiquitinated product. The diversity of products depends on the enzymes involved and the biological context and may include the addition of a single Ub onto a substrate lysine or the synthesis of poly-ubiquitin chains built from any of Ub’s seven lysine residues. To generate such diversity, there are ~40 human E2s that have presumably evolved disparate functions. Some E2s are specific for a single chain type, such as the Ubc13/Mms2 complex (K63-linked chains) or Ube2k (K48-linked chains), while others such as UbcH5c are promiscuous and can build Ub chains of multiple linkages . Some E2s such as Ube2e1 and Ube2t add only a single Ub to their target substrate. There is some evidence that certain E2s may transfer Ub to non-canonical amino acids such as serine, threonine, and cysteine. The E2 Ube2w was recently reported to attach mono-Ub to the αN-terminus of substrates rather than to the εNH2 side chain group of lysine residues. Here we show that Ube2w specifically mono-ubiquitinates the αN-terminus of diverse substrates by recognizing backbone atoms of disordered N-termini. The solution ensemble of Ube2w reveals a novel UBC (“Ubiquitin Conjugating”) domain architecture (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1). Though the first 118 residues adopt a canonical E2 fold, the Ube2w C-terminal region is partially unstructured and can occupy multiple positions near the active site. Removal of the final twenty C-terminal residues or a single point mutation within this region abrogates Ube2w ubiquitin transfer activity and impacts recognition and binding of multiple substrates. Furthermore, N-terminal substrate recognition and subsequent Ub transfer catalyzed by Ube2w are intimately dependent on the non-canonical arrangement of Ube2w C-terminal residues relative to its active site. RESULTS. UBE2W ADDS MONO-UB TO INTRINSICALLY DISORDERED N-TERMINI. RNA Polymerase Subunit 8 (RPB8) is a highly conserved subunit of RNA polymerases I, II, and, III that is ubiquitinated in cells by the RING E3 ligase BRCA1/BARD1 following UV-induced DNA damage. To identify the E2 – BRCA1/BARD1 pair(s) that can ubiquitinate RPB8, in vitro ubiquitination assays were performed using the minimal RING heterodimer of BRCA1/BARD1 (BC112/BD115), and E2s that had previously been shown to interact with BRCA1/BARD1: Ube2w, UbcH5c, UbcH7, and Ube2e1. Although RPB8 contains eight lysines, only Ube2w modifies RPB8 with Ub in the presence of BC112/BD115 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 2a). Ube2w also exhibits E3-independent modification, though with substantially lower activity (Supplementary Fig. 2a, Supplementary Figure 3). Mass spectrometry analysis of the mono-ubiquitinated RPB8 product confirmed that the Ub is attached to RPB8’s αN-terminus (Supplementary Fig. 4). It should be noted that an initial mono-Ub attached by Ube2w can serve as a primer for poly-Ub chain synthesis by another E2 such as Ubc13/MMS2 or Ube2k. A direct measure of the intrinsic aminolysis activity of an E2~Ub conjugate is its reactivity towards the εNH2 group of free lysine. Many E2s, such as UbcH5c, that transfer Ub to lysine side chains of protein substrates readily transfer Ub to free lysine. As shown in Fig. 1b (left panel), the Ube2w~Ub conjugate remained intact in the presence of free lysine but reacted completely with a peptide containing a free N-terminal amino group and no lysine (NH2-Ala-Gly-Gly-Ser-Tyr-COO-) (Fig. 1b left, Supplementary Fig 2b,c,5). In contrast, UbcH5c~Ub reacted completely with free lysine but did not react with the peptide substrate (Fig. 1b right panel). Thus, Ube2w’s intrinsic aminolysis reactivity is limited to αNH2 groups in the context of a polypeptide, as it did not transfer Ub to the αNH2 group of a free amino acid, while UbcH5’s intrinsic aminolysis reactivity is limited to εNH2 groups of lysine residues. In addition to RPB8, full-length CHIP (Carboxy terminus of HSP70-interacting protein), the minimal U-box domain of CHIP, small ubiquitin-like modifier 2 (SUMO-2), tau, ataxin-3, FANCL, FANCD2, and Ube2w have been reported to be ubiquitinated by Ube2w. In all cases, a single mono-Ub is attached, implying the N-terminus of the attached Ub cannot also serve as a Ube2w substrate. Serendipitously, we discovered that Ub harboring a 13-residue N-terminal Human influenza hemagglutinin-tag (HA-tag) is a robust Ube2w substrate in vitro. Unlike with WT-Ub, Ube2w adds multiple HA-Ubs onto RPB8 and this activity is retained with a lysine-less version, HA-Ub(K0), consistent with each attachment occurring through the αNH2 group (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2d). Notably, the major species formed under the reaction conditions used here (i.e., HA-Ub in excess over RPB8) are free poly-HA-Ub chains, as observed in an anti-Ub immunoblot of the same reaction (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 2e). {1H – 15N} NOE (hetNOE) values of HA-Ub, which are sensitive to high frequency motions on the pico to nano-second timescales, confirm that the additional residues in the HA tag are highly mobile as shown by their small and/or negative hetNOE values (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 6). In contrast, hetNOE values for Ub re",PMC,pos,1,pos,3720,pos_PMC,0.9974342,1
25484337,"Assessment of curated phenotype mining in neuropsychiatric disorder literature. Clinical evaluation of patients and diagnosis of disorder is crucial to make decisions on appropriate therapies. In addition, in the case of genetic disorders resulting from gene abnormalities, phenotypic effects may guide basic research on the mechanisms of a disorder to find the mutated gene and therefore to propose novel targets for drug therapy. However, this approach is complicated by two facts. First, the relationship between genes and disorders is not simple: one gene may be related to multiple disorders and a disorder may be caused by mutations in different genes. Second, recognizing relevant phenotypes might be difficult for clinicians working with patients of closely related complex disorders. Neuropsychiatric disorders best illustrate these difficulties since phenotypes range from metabolic to behavioral aspects, the latter extremely complex. Based on our clinical expertise on five neurodegenerative disorders, and from the wealth of bibliographical data on neuropsychiatric disorders, we have built a resource to infer associations between genes, chemicals, phenotypes for a total of 31 disorders. An initial step of automated text mining of the literature related to 31 disorders returned thousands of enriched terms. Fewer relevant phenotypic terms were manually selected by clinicians as relevant to the five neural disorders of their expertise and used to analyze the complete set of disorders. Analysis of the data indicates general relationships between neuropsychiatric disorders, which can be used to classify and characterize them. Correlation analyses allowed us to propose novel associations of genes and drugs with disorders. More generally, the results led us to uncovering mechanisms of disease that span multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, for example that genes related to synaptic transmission and receptor functions tend to be involved in many disorders, whereas genes related to sensory perception and channel transport functions are associated with fewer disorders. Our study shows that starting from expertise covering a limited set of neurological disorders and using text and data mining methods, meaningful and novel associations regarding genes, chemicals and phenotypes can be derived for an expanded set of neuropsychiatric disorders. Our results are intended for clinicians to help them evaluate patients, and for basic scientists to propose new gene targets for drug therapies. This strategy can be extended to virtually all diseases and takes advantage of the ever increasing amount of biomedical literature.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3733,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0018639286,0
25490258,"Structure of an APC3-APC16 complex: insights into assembly of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. INTRODUCTION. The Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) is a massive, 1.2 M Da E3 ligase complex that regulates numerous essential eukaryotic processes. APC/C was originally identified for its roles in controlling mitosis. Indeed, APC/C drives ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Cyclin B and Securin, and triggers sister chromatid separation. It is now known that APC/C catalyzes ubiquitination of numerous additional cell cycle regulatory proteins to orchestrate several steps of cell division, spanning from prometaphase, through mitosis, exit from mitosis and G1 , and APC/C also regulates meiosis . Furthermore, a staggering number of cell cycle-independent roles for APC/C-mediated ubiquitination have been identified in neurons . These numerous functions depend on the pairing of the core holo-APC/C complex with a coactivator, typically either CDC20 or the homologous CDH1, which bind various motif sequences such as a Lys-Glu-Asn “KEN-box” in substrates and regulatory proteins. Many substrates also display additional APC/C-interaction motifs, including a “D-box” (aka “Destruction-box”) that simultaneously engages a coactivator and the APC/C core subunit APC10 . Although details of interactions between different substrates and APC/C-coactivator complexes are only beginning to emerge , it is clear that ordered APC/C association with different coactivators, together with phosphorylation, regulates the timing of successive steps in the cell division process . The overall architecture of an APC/C-coactivator-substrate complex has been determined by combining information from electron microscopy (EM), biochemistry, and subunit tagging and deletion studies . The APC/C core comprises two multiprotein superdomains, which we describe here for human APC/C: the catalytic “Platform”, which contains APC1, APC2, APC4, APC5, APC11, APC15, and the scaffolding “Arc Lamp”, which contains APC8, APC13, APC6, APC12/CDC26, APC3, APC16, APC7, and APC10. Within the Platform, the APC2 and APC11 subunits are homologous to cullin and RBX subunits of cullin-RING E3 ligases, and represent the catalytic core . It appears that the major roles of APC1, APC4, APC5, and APC15 in the Platform are to coordinate the placement and conformation of the APC2-APC11 catalytic core for ubiquitin ligation to substrates recruited to domains organized by the Arc Lamp. The Arc Lamp was named for its curved form resembling an actual arc lamp emanating from the Platform . The curved scaffold-like structure is established by layers of homologous homodimeric tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) proteins - APC8, APC6, APC3, and APC7 in humans - stacked on top of each other. The TPR unit is a ~34-residue degenerate motif, which forms a pair of antiparallel helices . Tandem TPR repeats pack in parallel and form superhelical solenoids with various curvatures depending on interactions between adjacent repeats. APC8, APC6, APC3, APC7 are each predicted to contain roughly 14 TPRs, which homodimerize via N-terminal domains in head-to-tail arrangements that generate extended structures with the C-termini of the two protomers on each end . Within the holo-APC/C assembly, the border between the Platform and the Arc Lamp is established by the APC8 homodimer (Cdc23p in S. cerevisiae), on which the APC6 homodimer (Cdc16p in S. cerevisiae) is stacked. The APC3 homodimer (Cdc27p in S. cerevisiae) stacks on top of APC6, and in higher eukaryotes, APC7 stacks on the APC3 homodimer to complete the stack of TPR subunits. Also, several small proteins (CDC26, APC13, and APC16) are thought to stabilize the overall assembly of the Arc Lamp. Indeed, disrupting the function of small subunits leads to phenotypes ranging from temperature-sensitive cell cycle arrest in budding yeast (Cdc26) to meiotic and/or mitotic defects upon mutation or knockdown in worms or human cells (APC16) . A major function of the Arc Lamp is to serve as a scaffold for dynamic recruitment of substrates, by APC3 binding to homologous Ile-Arg “IR Tail” sequences displayed at the C-termini of APC10 and coactivators . Although there are two protomers of APC3, their context and binding to the different IR tails is asymmetric within the holo-APC/C. One of the two APC3 protomers is constitutively occupied by the IR tail of APC10 . This interaction is solidified by extensive contacts between APC1 and APC10’s N-terminal domain. Thus, in the context of the holo-APC/C, the APC10 C-terminal IR tail is proximal to only its dedicated partner APC3 protomer . This arrangement leaves only the opposite APC3 protomer available to dynamically associate with IR tails from different coactivators at different stages of the cell cycle . Insights into how APC3 assembles into the Arc Lamp and recruits IR-tails were recently provided by a landmark 7.4 Å resolution cryo-EM map and secondary structure definition for an APC/C-CDH1-Substrate complex . Nonetheless, residue-specific information is available only for some portions of the Arc Lamp, from crystal structures of a few human components (APC10 N-terminal domain and a subcomplex between human CDC26 and the C-terminal domain of APC6) and homology models based on structures of orthologs (a near full-length complex of S. pombe APC6-CDC26, coactivator complexes with D- and KEN-boxes, and the N-terminal domains of APC8 and APC3 from S. pombe and the parasite E. cuniculi, respectively) . Thus, despite importance, our understanding of how an APC3 dimer is integrated into the whole APC complex and recruits coactivators is limited by lack of high-resolution structural data for APC3.

25533489,"Molecular basis of histone tail recognition by human TIP5 PHD finger and bromodomain of the chromatin remodeling complex NoRC. SUMMARY. Binding of the chromatin remodeling complex NoRC to RNA complementary to the rDNA promoter mediates transcriptional repression. TIP5, the largest subunit of NoRC, is involved in recruitment to rDNA by interactions with promoter-bound TTF-I, pRNA, and acetylation of H4K16. TIP5 domains that recognize posttranslational modifications on histones are essential for recruitment of NoRC to chromatin, but how these reader modules recognize site-specific histone tails has remained elusive. Here, we report crystal structures of PHD zinc finger and bromodomains from human TIP5 and BAZ2B in free form and bound to H3 and/or H4 histones. PHD finger functions as an independent structural module in recognizing unmodified H3 histone tails, and the bromodomain prefers H3 and H4 acetylation marks followed by a key basic residue, KacXXR. Further low-resolution analyses of PHD-bromodomain modules provide molecular insights into their trans histone tail recognition, required for nucleosome recruitment and transcriptional repression of the NoRC complex. INTRODUCTION. Chromatin remodeling complex NoRC (nucleolar remodeling complex) interacts with the rDNA promoter regions of silent genes repressing rDNA transcription. It consists of TIP5 (TTF-I interacting protein 5), also known as BAZ2A (bromodomain [BRD] adjacent to zinc finger domain protein 2A), which is the largest subunit, and the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) SNF2h (sucrose nonfermenting protein 2 homologue). Human TIP5 is a 1,908 amino acid multidomain protein of a molecular weight of 211 kDa and consists of several protein and DNA interaction domains (Grummt, 2007). The biological function of the related human 240 kDa protein BAZ2B (BRD adjacent to zinc finger domain protein 2B) remains unknown, although it is postulated to regulate nucleosome mobilization through the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor ISWI (imitation switch), resulting in transcriptional regulation (Eberharter et al., 2004). BAZ2B shares 29% sequence identity with TIP5 at the full-length level and harbors similar domain organization. Both proteins contain a MBD (methyl-CpG-binding domain), also known as TAM (TTF-IIP5, ARBP, MeCP1) domain, AT-hook DNA-binding domains, DDT (DNA binding homeobox and different transcription factors), and a PHD (plant homeodomain) zinc finger adjacent to a BRD at their C terminus (Figure 1). Sequence similarity reaches up to 50% to 65% for individual PHDs and BRDs, suggesting related roles of these two proteins (Figure S1A available online). These functional domains are also shared with ACF1 (ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor) and WSTF (Williams syndrome transcription factor), two large subunits of human chromatin remodeling complexes hCHRAC (human chromatin accessibility complex) and hWICH (human WSTF-ISWI chromatin remodeling complex) (Wu et al., 2009). A recent study determined how the DNA-binding TAM and AT-hook components of TIP5 increase the association of rDNA with the nuclear matrix regulating large-scale chromatin organization (Zillner et al., 2013). On the other hand, it has been shown that the tandem PHD finger-BRD modules of human TIP5 represent an independent unit that interacts with H4K16ac and triggers the cascade of events that establish the repressed state of rDNA (Zhou and Grummt, 2005). Zhou and coworkers reported that inactive TIP5 BRD mutant at the conserved tyrosine does not repress Pol I transcription and suggested that interaction of the BRD with acetylated histone H4 is a key event in NoRC-mediated gene silencing. Additionally, nuclear localization assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing with deletion constructs of the PHD finger-BRD region have established a role for TIP5 abrogating NoRC-mediated transcriptional repression and heterochromatic features. Indeed, the PHD zinc finger adjacent to the BRD has an important role for the NoRC function, binding to DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases), HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1), and the ATPase subunit SNF2h, further establishing heterochromatic features (including DNA methylation, hypoacetylation of histone H4 and methylation of H3K9) at the rDNA promoter (Zhou et al., 2009). However, structural elucidation of the tandem PHD-BRD reader modules of TIP5 and BAZ2B as well as their recognition specificity toward histone tails have to date remained elusive. PHDs represent a diverse family of protein interaction domains that may specifically recognize methylated or unmodified histone tails, whereas BRDs recognize their target sequences usually in an acetylation-dependent manner (Sanchez and Zhou, 2011; Filippakopoulos et al., 2012). Coexistence of PHD-BRD module is evolutionary conserved and considerably more frequent than the pairing of other epigenetic effector domains (Figure 1). Synergistic combinatorial readout of epigenetic marks by PHD zinc finger and BRD modules has been characterized in several chromatin-associated proteins (Figure S1B). Structural studies on the tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing proteins revealed single tightly linked functional PHD-BRD units and a multivalent recognition on the same H3 histone tail mediated by interaction with unmodified K4 and acetylated K23 (for TRIM24) and unmodified K4, trimethylated K9, and acetylated K18 (for TRIM33) (Tsai et al., 2010; Xi et al., 2011). In contrast, interaction with two histones (H3 and H4) has been reported for the tandem PHD-BRD of BPTF (Ruthenburg et al., 2011), where the PHD finger recognizes methylation signatures at H3K4me2/3 and the BRD selectively binds to the H4K16ac acetylation mark. The simultaneous interaction with two histones is imparted by a rigid α-helical linker of 12 residues in length, preventing direct PHD-BRD interactions and enabling a trans histone intranucleosomal association. Another example of a BRD-PHD arrangement is found in the crystal structure of the human transcriptional activator CBP (Plotnikov et al., 2014) as well as in the structure of the ent",PMC,pos,1,pos,3749,pos_PMC,0.9981141,1
25554786,"Structure and inhibition of EV-D68, a virus that causes respiratory illness in children. Picornaviruses constitute a large family of small, icosahedral viruses with a single, positive-stranded RNA genome and an external diameter of about 300Å. The enterovirus (EV) genus includes medically-important human pathogens, such as human rhinoviruses (HRV), polioviruses (PV) and coxsackieviruses (CV) (table S1) (1, 2). Many of these viruses have been well characterized structurally and functionally (3–10). However, the species EV-D remains poorly characterized. An upsurge of EV-D68 cases in the past few years has shown clusters of infections worldwide (11). In August 2014 an outbreak of mild to severe respiratory illnesses occurred among thousands of young children in the United States of which 1116 cases have been confirmed to be caused by EV-D68. This virus has also been associated with occasional neurological infections (12). Although EV-D68 has emerged as a considerable global public health threat, there is no available vaccine or effective antiviral treatment. The capsids of EVs consist of 60 copies of each of four different viral proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4 (Fig. 1A). Of these VP1 (about 300 amino acids), VP2 (about 260 amino acids) and VP3 (about 240 amino acids) each have a “jelly roll” fold arranged in the capsid with pseudo T=3 icosahedral symmetry, where T represents the triangulation number (13). Their organization in the capsid is similar to that of the T=3 RNA plant viruses except that the three subunits related by quasi-3-fold symmetry have different amino acid sequences in picornaviruses (6, 10). Each roughly 70 amino acid long VP4 molecule forms an extended peptide on the internal surface of the capsid shell. The jelly roll fold consists of two anti-parallel β-sheets which face each other to form a β-barrel with a hydrophobic interior (Fig. 1B). Enteroviruses have a deep surface depression (“canyon”) circulating around each of the twelve pentameric vertices (Fig. 1A). The canyon was predicted to be the site of receptor binding because the amino acids outside the canyon that form the external surface of the virus were more exposed and were shown to be accessible to neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 1A) (10, 14). The virus thus could remain faithful to a specific receptor molecule that binds into the canyon while evading the host’s immune system (10, 15). The prediction that the canyon would be the site of binding to cellular receptor molecules was subsequently confirmed for numerous different enteroviruses (16, 17). All of the receptor molecules were found to have an immunoglobulin-like structure. A variety of small ~350 Da hydrophobic molecules that are inhibitors of enterovirus infection were shown to bind into the hydrophobic pocket in the center of the VP1 jelly roll (18) (Fig. 1B). They stabilize the virus (19) by filling the pocket with a well-fitting hydrophobic molecule, thereby inhibiting uncoating of the virus and the release of the genome into the infected cell. These compounds also prevent attachment to cells by altering the surface features of the canyon floor where the virus attaches to a cellular receptor (17, 19). The floor of the canyon is formed primarily by the GH loop of VP1, the connecting residues between β-strands G and H (18). Most infectious enteroviruses contain a small molecule or “pocket factor”, probably a fatty acid in the VP1 binding pocket (7, 18, 20). Like the capsid binding compounds, the pocket factor presumably stabilizes the virus by filling the VP1 hydrophobic pocket. Thus the virus is stabilized while being transmitted to a new host. However, when a receptor molecule binds to the floor of the canyon it depresses the floor (that also forms the roof of the VP1 binding pocket) which then squeezes the binding pocket, likely expelling the pocket factor (17). Thus attachment of the virus to a cell surface initiates uncoating, causing the loss of the genome into the cell’s cytosol. In most enteroviruses that have been investigated these capsid binding antiviral compounds displace the pocket factor (e,g. polioviruses, coxsackieviruses A or B, and many HRVs). The rhinoviruses HRV14 (18) and HRV3 (21) do not contain a pocket factor and the GH loop is displaced relative to its position in other enteroviruses that contain a pocket factor, reducing the volume of the VP1 pocket. Either neither HRV14 nor HRV3 bind a pocket factor in vivo or it was lost during the purification procedure. Much effort was made between 1985 and 2000 to design a compound that fits into the VP1 pocket and would inhibit the maximum number of rhinoviruses (22). The final optimal structure was pleconaril (fig. S1) which not only had good efficacy but was also stable enough to maintain good bioavailability in clinical tests (23). However, pleconaril was not licensed primarily because it put women using birth control drugs at risk of conception. The EV-D68 prototype strain Fermon CA62-1 was propagated in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells at 33°C, which had previously been shown to be the optimal growth temperature for EV-D68, indicating that EV-D68 behaves much like members of the RV-A and RV-B species that are responsible for common colds (24). The virus was purified and crystalized as described in Materials and Methods. The cubic looking crystals had a diameter between 0.1mm and 0.2mm. After soaking in glycerol, they were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at sector 14 of the Advanced Photon Source. The data extended to 2.0Å resolution and was processed with HKL2000 (25). The crystal symmetry was I222 with two particles per unit cell, implying that the particles were located on a 222 symmetry position. A rotation function (26) differentiated between the two orthogonal possible orientations of the icosahedron.

INTRODUCTION Obesity has been associated with hypercoagulability and to increased risk of both arterial and venous thromboembolic events. Many different and complex changes in plasma coagulation factors have been described in patients with obesity. The aim of this case-control study is to evaluate hypercoagulability in a group of overweight and obese subjects by whole blood rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) and impedance aggregometry (Multiplate®). METHODS ROTEM® and Multiplate® analyses were performed in 80 subjects with a BMI ≥ 25 Kg/m(2), of whom 20 overweight [BMI = 25-29.9 Kg/m(2)], 20 with I degree obesity [BMI = 30-34.9 Kg/m(2)], 20 with II degree obesity [BMI = 35-39.9 Kg/m(2)] and 20 with III degree [BMI > 40 Kg/m(2)] and compared with 80 age and gender-matched normal weight healthy individuals. RESULTS Thromboelastometry. In INTEM and EXTEM tests MCF and AUC were significantly increased in III degree obese compared with controls. MCF in FIBTEM was significantly higher in I, II and III degree obesity than controls (p = 0.027, 0.002 and < 0.001, respectively). Impedance aggregometry. A significant difference in platelet aggregation was found between III degree obese subjects and healthy controls in each of the tests considered. A significant correlation between FIBTEM-MCF and aggregometry parameters with BMI, waist circumference, leptin levels and high sensitive-C reactive proteins was also found. CONCLUSIONS A relationship between hypercoagulability detected by whole blood thromboelastometry and aggregometry and increased fat mass is shown. Hypercoagulability also correlated with inflammatory markers. Point-of-care tests can be used to assess the degree of hypercoagulability and hyperaggregability in obese patients.

The elucidation of the structural basis for the mode of action of Jaburetox is the focus of this multifaceted study. Jaburetox in solution is a monomer of 11.0 kDa featuring a large hydrodynamic radius, suggestive of a disordered polypeptide. The intrinsically disordered nature of Jaburetox was theoretically predicted by a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis and experimentally confirmed by light scattering as well as by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. NMR signal assignment provided backbone secondary chemical shifts that indicated that Jaburetox has a low propensity to assume a stable secondary structure.

25613934,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax oncoprotein represses the expression of the BCL11B tumor suppressor in T-cells. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), which is characterized as an aggressive mature T-cell leukemia. HTLV-1 has two oncoproteins, Tax and HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), both of which play crucial roles in persistent HTLV-1 infection and leukemogenesis.( Tax by itself immortalizes primary human T-cells in vitro, and tax-transgenic mice develop various malignancies, including mature T-cell leukemia. To achieve these effects, Tax interacts with several cellular proteins involved in cell cycle regulation,( apoptosis,( genomic instability( and DNA repair,( and modulates their functions. For instance, Tax interacts with various transcription regulatory factors, including cAMP-responsive element-binding protein/activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF) and IKK, through which Tax activates the expression of a number of cellular genes. Unlike Tax, HBZ is dispensable for T-cell immortalization by HTLV-1, but it was required for persistent HTLV-1 infection in an in vivo animal model.( In addition, HBZ-transgenic mice develop mature T-cell lymphoma.( HBZ also has multiple activities. For example, HBZ prevents apoptosis by promoting the anti-apoptotic function of FoxO3a.( HBZ upregulates the expression of the hTERT telomerase subunit gene,( and inhibits the transcriptional activation of cellular genes mediated by c-Jun, CREB/ATF and RelA.(. BCL11B is a transcriptional regulatory protein containing C2H2-type zinc fingers, and it is required for normal T-cell development.( Moreover, BCL11B has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Genetic alterations of BCL11B, such as by chromosomal rearrangements, have been identified in several T-ALL patients.( Intriguingly, HTLV-1-infected T-cells, including ATL cells, have been reported to have reduced BCL11B protein expression,( but the mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we show that the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax is sufficient to downregulate BCL11B expression in T-cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS. CELL LINES AND CULTURE CONDITION. SLB-1, HUT-102, MT-2 and MT-4 are HTLV-1-transformed human T-cell lines. TL-OmI, KK-1 and KOB are HTLV-1-positive ATL patient-derived cell lines. Jurkat and MOLT-4 are HTLV-1-negative T-cell lines. These human T-cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM l-glutamine and antibiotics (RPMI/10%FBS). Recombinant human IL-2 (Takeda Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) was added at 0.5 nM to the cultures of KK-1 and KOB cells. 293T cells, which are highly transfectable kidney-derived cells, were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM l-glutamine and antibiotics. PLASMIDS. CSII-EF-Tax-IRES and CSII-EF-Tax-IRES-sHBZ were the IRES-mediated bicistronic lentiviral vectors for Tax and Tax together with spliced-HBZ (sHBZ), respectively. CSII-EF-IRES-GFP was used as a control vector. The lentiviral expression vectors for HTLV-1 Tax, its mutants (TaxΔC, TaxM22, Tax703, Tax[225–232]) and HTLV-2 Tax2B have been described previously.( Tax(TTG) has a mutation from A to T at the initiation codon of tax gene, and, thus, it expresses the Tax transcript, but not its protein. Tax(TTG) cDNA was constructed by introducing mutation with the PCR. Next, the Tax(TTG) cDNA was cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and then the cDNA was transferred into lentiviral vector CSII-EF-IRESGFP-RfA( through an LR recombination reaction using LR clonase (Invitrogen). The expression vector pHβPr-1-neo was used for the transient expression of Tax, Tax2B and its mutant proteins (TaxΔC, TaxM22, Tax703) in Jurkat cells in order to perform a lucifearase assay as described previously.( Tax (225–232) protein is defective for the activation of the noncanonical NF-κB/p100/p52 pathway, but it is active for the canonical NF-κB pathway,( and the expression vector was constructed by inserting the Tax(225–232) gene into the expression vector pHβPr-1-neo. The transcriptional activity reporter plasmids, κB-luc, CRE-luc and pGK/β-gal, have all been described previously.(. LENTIVIRUS TRANSDUCTION. Recombinant lentiviruses were generated by transfecting pCAG-HIVgp, pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev and the respective lentiviral vectors into 293T cells using FuGENE HD (Roche Diagnostic, Mannheim, Germany). Seventy-two hours after transfection, the culture supernatants were harvested, and were infected into Jurkat or MOLT-4 cells (4 × 105) at a final volume of 2 mL of RPMI/10%FBS containing 8 µg/mL polybrene. QUANTITATIVE REAL-TIME RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from cells using the NucleoSpin RNA II Kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL; TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan), and RNA was reverse-transcribed using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa). BCL11B cDNA fragments were amplified and analyzed by the real-time PCR assay performed using SYBR Green Real-Time PCR Mix (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) with a 25 µL reaction volume. The quantity of BCL11B mRNA was normalized to the quantity of GAPDH mRNA. WESTERN BLOT ANALYSIS. The western blot analyses were carried out as described previously.( The primary antibodies used at the indicated dilutions were anti-BCL11B (1/1000),( anti-BCL11B (1/1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), anti-Tax (1/2000) (Taxy7),( anti-Tax2,( anti α-tubulin (DM1A) (1/1000) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) and α-HBZ (1/1000).( Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG kappa light chain (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (sc-2054; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) were used as secondary antibodies (1/10 000).

In this paper, we designed a novel core-shell composite for microwave absorption application in which the α-Fe2O3 and the porous CoFe2O4 nanospheres served as the core and shell, respectively. Interestingly, during the solvothermal process, the solvent ratio (V) of PEG-200 to distilled water played a key role in the morphology of α-Fe2O3 for which irregular flake, coin-like, and thinner coin-like forms of α-Fe2O3 can be produced with the ratios of 1:7, 1:3, and 1:1, respectively. The porous 70 nm diameter CoFe2O4 nanospheres were generated as the shell of α-Fe2O3. It should be noted that the CoFe2O4 coating layer did not damage the original shape of α-Fe2O3. As compared with the uncoated α-Fe2O3, the Fe2O3@CoFe2O4 composites exhibited improved microwave absorption performance over the tested frequency range (2-18 GHz). In particular, the optimal reflection loss value of the flake-like composite can reach -60 dB at 16.5 GHz with a thin coating thickness of 2 mm. Furthermore, the frequency bandwidth corresponding to the RLmin value below -10 dB was up to 5 GHz (13-18 GHz). The enhanced microwave absorption properties of these composites may originate from the strong electron polarization effect (i.e., the electron polarization between Fe and Co) and the electromagnetic wave scattering on this special porous core-shell structure. In addition, the synergy effect between α-Fe2O3 and CoFe2O4 also favored balancing the electromagnetic parameters.

Understanding how ligands bind to G-protein-coupled receptors and how binding changes receptor structure to affect signaling is critical for developing a complete picture of the signal transduction process. The adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) is a particularly interesting example, as it has an exceptionally long intracellular carboxyl terminus, which is predicted to be mainly disordered. Experimental data on the structure of the A2AR C-terminus is lacking, because published structures of A2AR do not include the C-terminus. Calmodulin has been reported to bind to the A2AR C-terminus, with a possible binding site on helix 8, next to the membrane. The biological meaning of the interaction as well as its calcium dependence, thermodynamic parameters, and organization of the proteins in the complex are unclear. Here, we characterized the structure of the A2AR C-terminus and the A2AR C-terminus-calmodulin complex using different biophysical methods, including native gel and analytical gel filtration, isothermal titration calorimetry, NMR spectroscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering. We found that the C-terminus is disordered and flexible, and it binds with high affinity (Kd = 98 nM) to calmodulin without major conformational changes in the domain.

HIGHLIGHTS. - • The 3-dimensional structure of a Rhodococcus equi virulence protein was determined. - • VapG comprises a closed beta barrel domain preceded by a natively disordered region. - • The structures of VapB, VapD and VapG are closely superimposable. - • The VAP structures lack recognisable ligand or protein binding sites. - • Phagosome-induced conformational changes may be required for virulence. 1. INTRODUCTION. Rhodococcus equi is a ubiquitous, soil bacterium which has evolved into an opportunistic pathogen through the acquisition of an 80 kbp virulence plasmid. Pathogenic R. equi infect different domesticated animal hosts (pigs, sheep and cattle) but are most frequently associated with bronchopneumonial disease in very young foals. It is also an emerging human pathogen, affecting immunocompromised individuals. In foals, disease is transmitted through inhalation of contaminated dust particles, leading to severe lung infection which eventually spreads to the gut and other areas (Meijer and Prescott, 2004; Vázquez-Boland et al., 2013). Excretion of contaminated faeces completes the infection cycle. Clinical manifestations of R. equi lung infection include bronchitis and pulmonary lesions (Prescott, 1991), and in the absence of treatment mortality rates are in the region of 80% (Muscatello et al., 2007). Thus, R. equi represents a major threat to foal health worldwide and has a significant economic impact on the horse breeding industry. Current treatments for R. equi infections involve combination drug therapies with rifampin and macrolides such as clarithromycin (Giguère et al., 2011). These treatments can be protracted and expensive, and are not always successful. Furthermore, antibiotic resistant strains are emerging (Andersen et al., 1997; Asoh et al., 2003). While vaccine trials are on-going and making headway (Hooper-McGrevy et al., 2005; Dawson et al., 2010; Whitehead et al., 2012), there are still no commercially available vaccines, and research investigations are now focussing on the mechanism of pathogenicity induced by R. equi in order to provide insights which may ultimately lead to better treatments for infection. R. equi is a Gram-positive coccobacillus with a lipid-rich cell envelope characteristic of the mycolata, a group of acid-fast actinomycetes that includes Mycobacterium, Corynebacterium and Nocardia species. It metabolises a wide range of organic and inorganic compounds and thrives on the mixture of organic compounds found in animal manure. Virulent R. equi enter alveolar macrophages by receptor-mediated phagocytosis and survive and proliferate in phagosomes. The bacterium has the ability to halt phagosome maturation prior to the late endocytic stage, thereby protecting it from normal bacteriocidal factors and allowing it to proliferate (Fernandez-Mora et al., 2005). Virulence of R. equi strains is strictly associated with the possession of an ∼80 kbp plasmid (Takai et al., 1991b; Tkachuk-Saad and Prescott, 1991). Plasmid-cured strains do not proliferate in macrophages, are cleared in murine models of infection, and are avirulent in foals (Hondalus and Mosser, 1994; Wada et al., 1997; Giguère et al., 1999). The virulence plasmid harbours a pathogenicity island (Fig. 1A) containing 26 coding sequences including that for the virulence-associated protein A (VapA). VapA is an ∼20 kDa immunodominant protein present in clinical isolates of infected foals (Takai et al., 1991a,b; Tan et al., 1995). A strain of R. equi with a vapA deletion mutation was shown to be unable to grow in macrophages and to be incapable of establishing infection in mice pointing to an essential role in virulence (Jain et al., 2003). However, plasmid-encoded factors other than VapA are needed for virulence since expression of wild type levels of VapA in otherwise virulent, plasmid-cured strains of R. equi does not restore virulence in mice or foals (Giguère et al., 1999). Similarly, in plasmid pathogenicity island-deleted strains of R. equi, constitutive expression of vapA could delay clearance of the pathogen from mice but it did not restore virulence (Coulson et al., 2010). Thus vapA is necessary but not sufficient for virulence and other pathogenicity island-encoded factors are required. Also encoded on the pathogenicity island are a set of virulence-associated proteins highly homologous to VapA; VapC, VapD, VapE, VapG, and VapH (Fig. 1A). In addition, there are three pseudogenes vapF, vapI and vapX which are not thought to code for functional proteins since they harbour substantial truncations and/or frameshifts. The role of these additional vap genes and whether they encode proteins with overlapping or redundant functions is not established. The available evidence indicates that these genes are not essential for virulence, at least in mice, since a mutant deleted for vapA, -C, -D, -E is complemented by vapA expressed in trans (Jain et al., 2003). The vap genes are induced by elevated temperature, starvation of various metals, and low pH, conditions likely to be encountered in the macrophage (Benoit et al., 2001; Ren and Prescott, 2003). vapA expression is dependent on two pathogenicity island factors, virR, which encodes a LysR type transcriptional regulator and virS (orf8) which encodes an orphan two-component system response regulator (Fig. 1A) (Ren and Prescott, 2003; Russell et al., 2004). Each of the vap genes encodes a secretion signal peptide consistent with the translocation of their gene products to the outside of the cell where many have been detected by immunoblotting of R. equi culture supernatants (Byrne et al., 2001). By contrast, VapA appears to be retained on the bacterial cell surface (Takai et al., 1992). In order to provide a framework for a new set of studies to investigate the critical function(s) of VapA and its role in R. equi virulence, we and others have sought to determine its three-dimensional structure. However, crystals of VapA have proved elusive and effort",PMC,pos,1,pos,3817,pos_PMC,0.99644804,1
25747659,"Phase transition of a disordered nuage protein generates environmentally responsive membraneless organelles. SUMMARY. Cells chemically isolate molecules in compartments to both facilitate and regulate their interactions. In addition to membrane-encapsulated compartments, cells can form proteinaceous and membraneless organelles, including nucleoli, Cajal and PML bodies, and stress granules. The principles that determine when and why these structures form have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the disordered tails of Ddx4, a primary constituent of nuage or germ granules, form phase-separated organelles both in live cells and in vitro. These bodies are stabilized by patterned electrostatic interactions that are highly sensitive to temperature, ionic strength, arginine methylation, and splicing. Sequence determinants are used to identify proteins found in both membraneless organelles and cell adhesion. Moreover, the bodies provide an alternative solvent environment that can concentrate single-stranded DNA but largely exclude double-stranded DNA. We propose that phase separation of disordered proteins containing weakly interacting blocks is a general mechanism for forming regulated, membraneless organelles. INTRODUCTION. Biochemical reactions in the cell frequently have mutually exclusive solution requirements, leading to a need to keep them spatially separated. Membrane encapsulation is a commonly used strategy in roles ranging from controlling the flow of genetic information, via the nucleus and the ER, to maintaining the isolated acidic environment within a lysosome. An alternative strategy involves the formation of membraneless, proteinaceous organelles, including the prominent nucleolus (Montgomery, 1898), PML bodies (de Thé et al., 1990; Melnick and Licht, 1999), Cajal bodies (Cajal, 1903) and nuclear speckles (Cajal, 1910) in the nucleus, and P bodies and both stress and germ granules in the cytoplasm. These cellular structures have been described as coacervates (Hyman and Brangwynne, 2011; Wilson, 1899) and are optically resolvable as spherical micron-sized droplets. The absence of a surrounding membrane enables these organelles to rapidly assemble or dissolve following changes in the cell’s environment and in response to intracellular signals, critical for cellular integrity and homeostasis (Dundr and Misteli, 2010) (Figure S1). A striking feature of membraneless organelles is that their largely proteinaceous interior partially excludes the bulk aqueous phase (Brangwynne, 2011; Hyman and Brangwynne, 2011). Such organelles behave as liquid droplets. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments interrogating organelles such as the nucleolus and Cajal bodies indicate that their constituent molecules internally diffuse rapidly (Phair and Misteli, 2000), and P-granules, the worm analog of mammalian nuage or germ granules, condense from a pool of diffuse constituents following specific biological cues (Brangwynne et al., 2009). Moreover, spherical nucleoli of the amphibian oocyte have been observed to coalesce when in close contact and show a size distribution that obeys a simple power law, indicating the formation of liquid droplets (Brangwynne et al., 2011). On a residue level, sequences of low complexity, such as repeated RG, QN, and YG repeats, are important for forming RNA granules, stress granules and P bodies (Decker et al., 2007; Kato et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2011). An understanding of the interactions that stabilize such structures and regulate their biogenesis, as well as a rationale for their biochemical function, has remained elusive. To address these questions, we have studied a dominant protein constituent of a membraneless organelle as a model. Ddx4 proteins are essential for the assembly and maintenance of the related nuage in mammals, P-granules in worms, and pole plasm and polar granules in flies (Liang et al., 1994). This epigenetically crucial nuage/chromatoid body (CB) family of membraneless organelles hosts components of an RNAi pathway, guarding spermatocytes and spermatids against the deleterious activity of transposable elements (Kotaja and Sassone-Corsi, 2007). Typical of non-membrane encapsulated organelles, nuages are generally spherical and dynamically change in number, size, and composition over their lifecycle (Meikar et al., 2011), appearing first in the juxtanuclear cytoplasm of early spermatocytes, moving toward the base of the flagellum during spermatogenesis before finally dispersing. A primary constituent of nuage is Ddx4 (Kotaja et al., 2006). In addition to a central DEAD-box RNA helicase domain that uses ATP to unwind short RNA duplexes, Ddx4 has extended N and C termini that are predicted to be intrinsically disordered (Figures 1A and S2) (Forman-Kay and Mittag, 2013). Here, we demonstrate that human Ddx4 and its isolated disordered N terminus spontaneously self-associate both in cells and in vitro into structures that are indistinguishable from the cellular Ddx4-organelles. The mechanism for this is a phase separation commonly encountered in polymer chemistry, and the interactions that hold the organelles together are primarily electrostatic in origin. Moreover, arginine methylation, alternative splicing, and changes in ionic strength and temperature under near-physiological conditions readily dissolve the Ddx4 bodies. Two highly conserved features in the sequence of Ddx4 that enable droplet formation are identified: repeating 8–10 residue blocks of alternating net charge and an over-representation of FG, GF, RG, and GR motifs within the positively charged blocks. These features are found to occur in a significant number of intrinsically disordered proteins associated with membraneless organelles. The interior of the organelles concentrate single-stranded DNA, yet largely exclude double-stranded DNA, suggesting that the bodies play a role in localizing nucleic acids. These findings lend insights into the role of intrinsically disordered proteins in the regulated spontaneous self-assembly of cellular membraneless organelles.

25753662,"An intrinsically disordered region of methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) recruits the histone deacetylase core of the NuRD complex. INTRODUCTION. Epigenetic regulation comprises heritable changes in gene expression most commonly brought about by DNA methylation and histone modifications. The predominant form of DNA methylation in mammals involves addition of a methyl group to the C5 carbon of the cytosine residue in a cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) through the enzymatic activity of DNA methyl-transferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B (1). Regions of high CpG density are often associated with gene promoters (2), which remain unmethylated except for a subset of tissue-specific genes involved in normal differentiation and development (3–6). Aberrant hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters is associated with oncogenesis in a wide array of tissues (7). The methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) family proteins recognize this methylated mark and repress the associated genes by recruiting different co-repressor complexes. The MBD family of proteins include the first identified MeCP2 (8) and MBD1, MBD2, MBD3 and MBD4 (9). With the exception of mammalian MBD3, all MBD proteins bind to methylated DNA although with varying affinities (10–13). MBD2 binds densely methylated CpG islands and represses transcription of the associated genes through recruitment of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) co-repressor complex (14). The MBD2-NuRD co-repressor complex from both cell lines and primary cells has been characterized and is comprised of at least one copy each of the MTA1/2/3, HDAC1/2, RbAp46/48, p66α/β, and CHD3/4 and MBD2 proteins (5,14–16). Recent studies have evaluated the stoichiometry of protein interactions in the NuRD complex (15,16), however much remains to be explored about the nature and assembly of protein–protein interactions within this complex. Previous work in our laboratory identified MBD2 as a silencer of the chicken ρ-globin gene (5,17,18) as well as murine and human embryonic and fetal β-type globin genes in adult erythroid cells (4,18,19). In addition, MBD2 has been implicated in aberrant silencing of methylated tumor suppressor genes in carcinogenesis (20–26). The MBD2 protein consists of an N-terminal glycine-arginine repeat region (GR), a methyl-binding domain (MBD) which binds in vivo to densely methylated DNA (27), an uncharacterized domain of MBD2 (MBD2IDR) and a coiled-coil domain. In previous work we showed that the C-terminal coiled-coil of MBD2 binds to the p66α component of NuRD, which contributes to the recruitment of CHD4 and gene silencing. Consistent with these findings, the p66α coiled-coil domain peptide can bind to native MBD2 in cells and relieve MBD2-mediated repression of target genes such as the embryonic and fetal β-type globin genes in adult erythroid cell culture systems (18). This proof-of-concept study underscored the biological significance of functional disruption of the MBD2-NuRD co-repressor complex and led us to pursue characterization of other MBD2 mediated interactions within the NuRD complex. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a rapidly advancing area of research due to their importance in human biology. Although IDPs lack a stable three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions, they can serve as hubs of multi-protein interactions for diverse cellular functions including transcription regulation, chromatin remodeling and cell signaling because the intrinsic disorder permits transient, low affinity but high specificity protein–protein and nucleic acid-protein interactions (28). Among the MBD protein family members, the transcription repression domain of MBD1 (29) and 60% of full-length MeCP2 protein have been shown to be intrinsically disordered (30), even in the presence of their binding partners. Having previously determined the structures of the MBD and coiled-coil domains of MBD2, we present here the unique structural and functional features of the previously uncharacterized MBD2IDR. We show that this region is intrinsically disordered in isolation and in the context of the full-length protein bound to DNA, we identify its role in modifying kinetics and affinity of DNA-binding, and map the critical sites needed for MBD2IDR to recruit the histone deacetylase core complex within the context of the intact MBD2 protein in cells. We anticipate these results will facilitate efforts for further biochemical and structural characterization of the MBD2-NuRD complex and open up avenues to target co-repressor activities of MBD2-NuRD via disruption of MBD2IDR-mediated interactions with the NuRD complex. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. Various MBD2 constructs (Figure 1a) were cloned into a modified pET32a vector (31) including: the MBD2IDR of human (amino acids 238–356) and mouse (amino acids 241–359) MBD2; a human single-chain coiled-coil domain construct (scMBD2-p66α) comprised of the MBD2 coiled-coil domain (amino acids 361–393), a short GGSG linker, and the p66α coiled-coil domain (amino acids 137–178); human MBD2MBD construct comprised of the isolated MBD (amino acids 150–214), and a slightly longer construct that incorporates the MBD through the first twenty amino acids from the MBD2IDR (amino acids 150–260), and a full-length human MBD2 single-chain construct (MBD2FLsc) comprised of MBD2 (amino acids 150–393) and the scMBD2-p66α. Note that the full-length construct does not incorporate the N-terminal GR repeat region unique to mammalian MBD2 proteins.

25768633,"Lattice Boltzmann formulation for conjugate heat transfer in heterogeneous media. In this paper, we propose an approach for studying conjugate heat transfer using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The approach is based on reformulating the lattice Boltzmann equation for solving the conservative form of the energy equation. This leads to the appearance of a source term, which introduces the jump conditions at the interface between two phases or components with different thermal properties. The proposed source term formulation conserves conductive and advective heat flux simultaneously, which makes it suitable for modeling conjugate heat transfer in general multiphase or multicomponent systems. The simple implementation of the source term approach avoids any correction of distribution functions neighboring the interface and provides an algorithm that is independent from the topology of the interface. Moreover, our approach is independent of the choice of lattice discretization and can be easily applied to different advection-diffusion LBM solvers. The model is tested against several benchmark problems including steady-state convection-diffusion within two fluid layers with parallel and normal interfaces with respect to the flow direction, unsteady conduction in a three-layer stratified domain, and steady conduction in a two-layer annulus. The LBM results are in excellent agreement with analytical solution. Error analysis shows that our model is first-order accurate in space, but an extension to a second-order scheme is straightforward. We apply our LBM model to heat transfer in a two-component heterogeneous medium with a random microstructure. This example highlights that the method we propose is independent of the topology of interfaces between the different phases and, as such, is ideally suited for complex natural heterogeneous media. We further validate the present LBM formulation with a study of natural convection in a porous enclosure. The results confirm the reliability of the model in simulating complex coupled fluid and thermal dynamics in complex geometries.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,3826,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0023006375,0
25849143,"Structural mechanism of integrin inactivation by filamin. Integrins are a family of major cell surface receptors that mediate essentially every life process by orchestrating adhesion of cells to extracellular matrix (ECM) and promoting many dynamic cell adhesion processes such as migration, spreading, and survival. Integrins are obligate (α/β) heterodimers with each subunit composed of a large ligand binding domain (ectodomain), a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (CT). Integrins can exist in either resting or active state with the latter being capable of binding to ECM and triggering cell-ECM adhesion. The resting state integrin is often depicted as a “naked” form, which may bind integrin activators, e.g., talin, and then convert into the active state via conformational change. However, recent studies have suggested that a more complex mechanism can exist in which critical intracellular integrin inactivators may mediate integrin deactivation or retention of the inactive receptor during cyclical cell adhesion processes such as migration (For most recent review, see ref 3). The underlying molecular basis as to how the inactivators engage integrin to control the dynamic equilibrium between the resting and active state of the receptor remains elusive. One widely proposed mechanism is the competition between inactivator and activator for binding to an overlapping binding site on integrin CT. For example, filamin was shown to compete with talin for binding to an overlapping site at the integrin β CT C-terminus. It was also proposed that an inactivator may engage inactive state of integrin but no information is available as to how such interaction occurs at atomic level and inhibits integrin activation. The focus of this study is on the integrin inactivator filamin - a large actin cross-linking protein (280kDa) that is known to regulate the cytoskeleton and many dynamic cell adhesion responses including cell migration, spreading, and proliferation. Filamin contains two N-terminal actin binding domains followed by 24 contiguous immunoglobulin-like (Ig) repeats that engage many protein binding partners. Filamin Ig repeat 21 was previously shown to bind integrin and inhibit the receptor activation. Consistently, ablation or decreased expression of filamin was found to enhance integrin-mediated cell-substrate adhesion in multiple different cell lines whereas strengthened filamin-integrin interaction inhibits integrin-ligand interaction and cell migration. Here, using NMR spectroscopy, we set out to determine the solution structure of platelet integrin αIIbβ3 cytoplasmic domain bound to filamin A Ig repeat 21 (FLNa-Ig21). Surprisingly, the structure reveals a ternary complex where FLNa-Ig21 not only binds to previously predicted C-terminal site of integrin β3 cytoplasmic tail (CT), which was thought to block the talin binding, but also engages two N-terminal helices of αIIb and β3 CTs, which stabilizes an inter-CT clasp that helps restrain the integrin at resting state. The results reveal a novel mechanism of filamin-mediated retention of integrin at a resting state. They also provide a new framework for understanding the dynamic regulation of integrin activation crucial for mediating diverse cell adhesion-dependent physiological and pathological processes. RESULTS. FLNA-IG21 BINDS TO BOTH INTEGRIN ΑIIB AND Β3 CTS. Previous studies showed that filamin recognizes the C-terminus of integrin β CTs. However, a detailed structural characterization of how filamin may engage the complete integrin cytoplasmic face has not been reported. To address this issue, we decided to use NMR to analyze the filamin A binding to αIIbβ3 – the prototypic integrin whose CT complex has been characterized before. We first performed heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiment to examine the binding of filamin A Ig repeat 21 (FLNa-Ig21) to 15N-labeled β3 CT K716-T762 (Fig. 1a). As expected, FLNa-Ig21 induced chemical shift changes of the C-terminal integrin β3 CT (β3-C). However, surprisingly, FLNa-Ig21 also induced spectral perturbation (line-broadening) of the N-terminal membrane-proximal region of β3 CT (β3-MP), suggesting that FLNa-Ig21 not only binds to β3-C but also to β3-MP. To further investigate this unexpected binding mode, we designed a construct containing β3-MP (K716-W739, β3-N) but lacking β3-C. Supplementary Fig. 1a shows that purified 15N-labeled β3-N indeed bound to FLNa-Ig21. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments revealed KD~223µM (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Consistently, SPR experiments also produced sensorgrams of full length β3-CT binding to FLNa-Ig21 that could fit into a two-site binding model with KD1~4.9µM and KD2~150µM respectively (Fig. 1b). The latter may correspond to the β3-N-FLNa-Ig21 interaction (Supplementary Fig 1b) whereas the former may reflect the β3-C-FLNa-Ig21 interaction. This two site binding mode is remarkably reminiscent of the integrin activator talin-F3 binding to integrin β CT, yet FLNa-Ig21 and talin-F3 have completely opposite effects on integrin activation. Supplementary Fig. 1c shows that β3-N, which is bound to FLNa-Ig21, exhibits helical conformation, suggesting that while β3-C occupies the known groove of C and D strands (CD groove) of FLNa-Ig21 to form β-sheet, β3-N helix may dock onto FLNa-Ig21 in a different and nonexclusive mode. To gain more definitive evidence for this binding mode, we designed a FLNa-Ig21-β3-C chimera based on the crystal structure of FLNa-Ig21-β7-C complex (PDB code 2BRQ, see details in the method section). This construct allows β3-C to tightly occupy the CD groove of FLNa-Ig21 as the strand (confirmed in supplementary Fig 1d), which would prevent potential displacement by β3-N if the two β3 CT fragments bound to FLNa-Ig21 in a mutually exclusive manner. Supplementary Fig 1e shows that β3-N, which binds to FLNa-Ig21 weakly, still induced chemical shift changes of FLNa-Ig21 in the 15N-labeled FLNa-Ig21-β3-C chimera, thus providing strong evidence that β3-C and β3-N",PMC,pos,1,pos,3842,pos_PMC,0.997917,1
25951439,"Structure-based discovery of the first non-covalent inhibitors of Leishmania major tryparedoxin peroxidase by high throughput docking. Leishmaniases are a class of infectious diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania, transmitted through the bite of phlebotomine sandflies. According to the World Health Organization, visceral leishmaniasis kills more than 20000 people every year and over 310 million people are believed to be at risk of infection1. Treatment of these diseases is unsatisfactory in terms of safety and efficacy, which sharply contrasts with the therapeutic need in terms of number of people at risk, affected patients, and associated fatalities. This discrepancy is primarily due to the prevalence of these diseases in poor tropical and subtropical countries whose drug development capacity is limited. As a consequence, only a small number of drugs are available, namely antimony-containing compounds (Pentostam) and miltefosine. Both of these drugs present severe side effects and miltefosine is too expensive to be used in underdeveloped countries2. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new efficacious, less toxic and more affordable drugs. The trypanothione-dependent hydroperoxide metabolism, characteristic of Trypanosomatids, has been recognized as a promising target for anti-leishmanial drug development since it is absent in the host and most of its components are essential to parasite survival3. Indeed, the defense of these parasites against the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by macrophages during the infection depends on the enzymes involved in the unique dithiol trypanothione (N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine, T(SH)2) metabolism. T(SH)2 is synthesized by the Trypanothione Synthetase (TryS) and maintained in the reduced state by Trypanothione Reductase (TR)45. T(SH)2 participates in crucial thiol-disulfide exchange reactions and serves as electron donor in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water catalyzed by the tryparedoxin/tryparedoxin peroxidase couple (TXN/TXNPx). Leishmania TXNPx is a particularly interesting drug target. On the one hand, TXNPx has been proven to be necessary for parasite survival by gene disruption in the Leishmania infantum amastigote; on the other, TXNPx overexpression in Leishmania chagasi (L. infantum) confers H2O2, t-butyl hydroperoxide and peroxynitrite resistance67. Leishmania major TXNPx (LmTXNPx) is an obligate homodimer whose active site is formed by the N-proximal peroxidatic cysteine (Cp) from one subunit and a C-proximal resolving cysteine from the two-fold symmetry related subunit (Cr′)89. According to the generally accepted mechanism, the hydrogen peroxide reduction catalyzed by TXN/TXNPx couple consists of two distinct reactions. In the first reaction, oxidized TXNPx binds TXN, which reduces the inter-subunit disulfide bridge (Cp–Cr′) and, thereafter, is reduced by T(SH)2. In the second reaction, the Cp thiolate of a TXNPx monomer reduces the hydrogen peroxide to water and is oxidized to sulfenic acid (-SOH); the sulfenic Cp then reacts with the Cr′ of the two-fold symmetry related monomer forming a disulfide bridge. The transition of 2-Cys peroxiredoxin from reduced to oxidized state is associated with a conformational change involving the protein regions where Cp and Cr′ are located, namely the Cp loop and the C-terminal arm, respectively. Usually peroxiredoxins in reduced state assume the so-called fully folded (FF) conformation, where: i) Cp is part of an α-helical turn, and is oriented toward the catalytic cavity; and ii) the C-terminal tail is partially folded in an α-helix, and covers the catalytic cavity. Protein oxidation promotes a transition to a locally unfolded (LU) conformation, where: i) the α-helical turn containing Cp unwinds and rotates toward the solvent; and ii) the C-terminal tail unfolds and becomes disordered. The transition from FF to LU conformation is essential for catalysis in most peroxiredoxins, and has been related to changes in protein quaternary structure, from a decameric assembly in FF conformation to a dimeric one in LU conformation10. Recently Fiorillo et al.11 have shown by gel-filtration experiments that LmTXNPx displays a decameric assembly in both the oxidized and the reduced states, and that the LU conformation is the most populated within the low resolution crystal structure of LmTXNPx (PDB ID: 3TUE)11 obtained under reducing conditions. In this structure, the C-terminal region (residues 169–199) is not visible, even if Cp is reduced. This finding is unusual but not unprecedented since human peroxiredoxin 4 in the reduced state may adopt mixed conformations (PDB ID: 3TKQ)12 and in the structure of Crithidia fasciculata TXNPx in the reduced state (PDB ID: 1E2Y)9 only three out of the ten monomers forming the decameric assembly assume a correct FF conformation. Conversely, the structure of peroxiredoxin in the oxidized state has been always found to assume the LU conformation. Therefore, structural data suggest that while peroxiredoxins in the oxidized state do assume the LU conformation, peroxiredoxins in reduced state may assume both the FF and LU conformations. In this paper, we report the X-ray crystal structure of LmTXNPx in FF conformation at high resolution. Structure-based high-throughput docking to the available crystal structures of LmTXNPx identified several compounds as potential enzyme inhibitors. Compounds able to inhibit the activity of TXNPx in an enzymatic assay were characterized in detail by surface plasmon resonance. Based on both the resulting inhibitory activity and examination of the docking models, a family of N,N-disubstituted 3-aminomethyl quinolone derivatives (1–12, Figure 1) was rationally designed, synthesized and experimentally characterized. As a result of this work, we discovered the first non-covalent inhibitors of TXNPxs reported to date. These represent suitable leads for the development of novel, effective and safer anti-leishmania drugs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. X-RAY CRYSTAL STRUCTURE STUDY.

25957688,"Structural snapshots of actively translating human ribosomes. SUMMARY. Macromolecular machines, such as the ribosome, undergo large-scale conformational changes during their functional cycles. While their mode of action is often compared to that of mechanical machines, a crucial difference is that at the molecular dimension, thermodynamic effects dominate functional cycles, with proteins fluctuating stochastically between functional states defined by energetic minima on an energy landscape. Here, we have used cryo-electron microscopy to image ex vivo-derived human polysomes as a source of actively translating ribosomes. Multiparticle refinement and three-dimensional variability analysis allowed us to visualize a variety of native translation intermediates. Significantly populated states include not only elongation cycle intermediates in pre- and post-translocational states, but also eEF1A-containing decoding and termination/recycling complexes. Focusing on the post-translocational state, we extended this assessment to the single-residue level, uncovering striking details of ribosome-ligand interactions and identifying both static and functionally important dynamic elements. INTRODUCTION. At the heart of many biological processes are complex and dynamic macromolecular machines. Different from macroscopic machines, these operate intermittently rather than continuously. Because inertia is irrelevant at the nanometer scale, conformational changes are dominated by thermal forces (Frauenfelder et al, 1991; Purcell, 1977). Consequently, macromolecular machines randomly sample all conformational states available to them at a given temperature, instead of passing smoothly from one functional state to the other (Frauenfelder et al., 1991). Functional states represent local minima in their energy landscape, defined by energetically costly conformational changes required to transit to neighbouring minima. The ribosome is an archetypical molecular machine, synthesizing proteins based on the primary sequence information encoded in messenger RNA (mRNA) templates (Frank and Spahn, 2006; Voorhees and Ramakrishnan, 2013). The ribosome consists of a large subunit (LSU; 60S in eukaryotes) containing the peptidyl transferase centre (PTC), and a small subunit (SSU; 40S in eukaryotes) containing the mRNA decoding centre (DC). Together, both subunits define three distinct transfer RNA-(tRNA-)binding sites in their intersubunit space, referred to as the aminoacyl-(A-)site responsible for binding and decoding incoming aminoacylated tRNAs, the peptidyl-(P-)site responsible for orienting the polypeptide-bearing P-site tRNA for efficient transamidation, and the exit-(E-)site responsible for subsequent release of deacylated tRNA. Protein synthesis can be divided into the four phases initiation, elongation, termination and recycling (Melnikov et al., 2012). Each phase comprises numerous distinct functional states, and multiple large-scale intra- and inter-subunit rearrangements of the ribosome and its ligands drive the functional cycle (Dunkle and Cate, 2010; Korostelev et al., 2008). Dynamic single-molecule distance measurements show that these rearrangements are governed by a rugged energy landscape that is shaped by translation factors (Munro et al., 2009; Petrov et al., 2011). Many functional intermediates of translation have been structurally analysed employing both X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (Moore, 2012; Voorhees and Ramakrishnan, 2013). The focus of these studies has been on bacterial complexes, while considerably less is known about the structures of functional states sampled by ribosomes from higher eukaryotes. Traditionally, such structural studies rely on in vitro assembled complexes and on the use of antibiotics, tRNA mimics, non-hydrolysable nucleotide analogues or genetic modifications in order to stall ribosomes in defined states. It is still largely unknown if or how in vitro assemblies differ from their in vivo counterparts that are assembled in the complex context of the living cell. Only by investigating samples in a native(-like) setting can these issues be addressed. While cryo-electron tomography allows the visualization of individual, active molecular machines inside cells (Brandt et al., 2010; Myasnikov et al., 2014), its resolution is limited. Recognizing that in vitro systems are not able to account for the full complexity of in vivo environments, we considered studying native translation intermediates by imaging ex vivo-derived non-stalled and unmodified polysomes from human cell extracts using multiparticle cryo-EM. Polysomes are formed by actively translating ribosomes and are therefore expected to constitute a mixture of ribosomes in elongation states (Rich et al., 1963). Thus, polysomes bear the potential to study the process of translation using one single specimen and to obtain not only multiple structural snapshots of functional states from the same sample, but also to determine the native distribution of states to approximate the positions of minima on the energy landscape, if conformational and compositional heterogeneity can be overcome by particle image sorting procedures (Spahn and Penczek, 2009). To further structural insights into the process of protein synthesis inside the living cell, we report here the structural analysis of ex vivo-derived human polysomes using multiparticle cryo-EM. We show that a variety of functional states are significantly populated, providing critical structural insights into minima of the energy landscape of the ribosomal elongation cycle and the rate-limiting steps close to the in vivo situation. We also demonstrate that subunit rolling (Budkevich et al., 2014) indeed constitutes a degree of freedom sampled in vivo. Focussing on a larger subset of particle images, we solve the structure of the human 80S ribosome in the post-translocational state at near-atomic resolution despite conformational and compositional heterogeneity.

25963737,"The structure of FMNL2-Cdc42 yields insights into the mechanism of lamellipodia and filopodia formation. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic structure that regulates cell shape and motility. The assembly of globular actin molecules into actin filaments (F-actin) is spatially and temporally controlled by nucleation and elongation factors. Among these, the multidomain proteins of the formin family regulate a variety of distinct F-actin structures in vertebrates, such as stress fibres, filopodia, lamellipodia or cell adhesions123. Formins thus influence a large number of major cellular processes like cell migration, polarity and cell cycle progression. The 15 mammalian formins that are defined by the presence of formin homology (FH) domains cluster into 8 different families based on their domain architectures4. The actin polymerization activity of formins is mediated by the FH2 domain that resembles an anti-parallel, torus-shaped dimer, which remains associated with the F-actin barbed end on elongation56. The FH2 domain is preceded by a proline-rich FH1 domain that interacts with profilin-actin and accelerates the elongation rate of actin filaments78. For some formins, the region C-terminal to the FH2 domain may additionally contribute to actin polymerization kinetics91011. Besides regulating elongation, formins possess actin nucleation121314, filament bundling15 and presumably severing11 activity. The activity of some formins is regulated by an N- to C-terminal intramolecular interaction that renders the protein inactive, giving rise to the classification as Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs). In DRFs, the N-terminal regulatory domains comprise a GTPase-binding domain (GBD) followed by an FH3 domain that interacts with the C-terminal Diaphanous-autoregulatory domain (DAD). The inhibition is released on binding of an active Rho-GTPase to the formin GBD161718. With the exception of FHOD, all mammalian DRFs also harbour a dimerization element C-terminal to the FH3 domain, constituting a second seed for the overall assembly of these proteins into multimers. Rho family GTPases cycle between an inactive, GDP-bound state and an active, GTP-bound state19. In the active state, they have been shown to regulate cellular signalling by binding to a large variety of downstream effectors linking extracellular stimuli to actin cytoskeleton rearrangements20. Activation of the autoinhibited formin is supposed to occur on displacement of the autoregulatory DAD by the GTPase171821. However, additional signals such as phosphorylation of the DAD or other DAD-interacting factors may also stabilize the active conformation of the DRF22. The mammalian formin-like proteins constitute one family of DRFs, which include the large, multidomain proteins FMNL1, FMNL2 and FMNL3 (also known as FRL1 or formin-related gene in leucocytes, FRL3/FHOD2 and FRL2/FHOD3, respectively)23. An actin filament polymerization and bundling activity of FMNL formins have been described2425262728; in addition, FMNL1 appears to sever actin filaments24. The misregulation of FMNL proteins has been shown to cause various tumours, such as chronic lymphatic leukaemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma2930, but also colorectal carcinoma31 and breast carcinoma32. In agreement with this, the macrophage-enriched FMNL1 has been reported to be involved in cell adhesion, migration and survival23. FMNL1 has furthermore been reported to be an essential regulator of centrosome polarity33, to exhibit crucial functions in the cytotoxic activation of T cells33 and to be required for Fcγ receptor-induced phagocytosis34. FMNL2 contributes to the formation of protrusive actin structures such as lamellipodia and filopodia at the leading edge of migrating cells2835. Consistently, overexpression of this protein appears to cause metastasis of tumour cells3136. Furthermore, depletion of FMNL2 has been implicated in developmental disorders like mental retardation, premature onset of puberty and limb abnormalities37. To date, it remains unclear how FMNL formins are activated and how the specificity of GTPases for formin effectors is determined. Several Rho GTPases such as RhoC, Rac1 and Cdc42 have been implicated in the activation of FMNL1 and FMNL2 (refs 23, 28, 32, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40). Aside from interacting with Rho GTPases, membrane targeting mechanisms emerged as an important feature of formins, as the actin-based protrusions are confined to distinct cellular compartments. We have previously shown that Cdc42 recruits full-length FMNL2 into lamellipodia and filopodia28. Here we uncover the structural basis of the specificity of FMNL1 and FMNL2 binding towards Cdc42, its membrane association, as well as the dimerization properties of the formin. We find that the insert helix of Cdc42 contributes essential interactions to the formin effector and that the protein complex forms a convex membrane interaction site to promote filopodia and lamellipodia outgrowth. RESULTS. OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE CDC42–FMNL2N COMPLEX. To explore the activating complex between Cdc42 and FMNL2, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of the GBD-FH3 domains of human FMNL2 (amino acids (aa) 1–379, termed FMNL2N) with Cdc42 (1–179) bound to the non-hydrolyzing nucleotide analogue GppNHp (Fig. 1a,b). The structure was determined to 2.5 Å resolution; the asymmetric unit of the crystal contained one heterodimer and the structure model was refined to an Rwork of 19.4% and Rfree of 25.3% with excellent stereochemistry (Table 1). Compared with the published structure of mDia1N bound to Cdc42 (ref. 21), the FMNL2N–Cdc42GppNHp structure shows remarkable differences in the interaction of the GTPase with the armadillo repeat helices of the formin. The buried molecular surface area of 3,034 Å2 counting both molecules FMNL2N and Cdc42 is 51% larger than that of mDia1N–Cdc42. This increase in interaction surface is mostly due to additional contacts formed between the Cdc42 insert helix and the fourth and fifth armadillo repeat of the FH3 domain. The FH3 domain of FMNL2 is composed of 14 canonical helices that assemb",PMC,pos,1,pos,3877,pos_PMC,0.9973061,1
25999477,"Akt-mediated phosphorylation increases the binding affinity of hTERT for importin α to promote nuclear translocation. Telomeres are essential for chromosome integrity and protection, and their maintenance requires the ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase. Previously, we have shown that human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS; residues 222-240) that is responsible for nuclear import, and that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of residue S227 is important for efficient nuclear import of hTERT. Here, we show that hTERT binds to importin-α proteins through the bipartite NLS and that this heterodimer then forms a complex with importin-β proteins to interact with the nuclear pore complex. Depletion of individual importin-α proteins results in a failure of hTERT nuclear import, and the resulting cytoplasmic hTERT is degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Crystallographic analysis reveals that the bipartite NLS interacts with both the major and minor sites of importin-α proteins. We also show that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of S227 increases the binding affinity for importin-α proteins and promotes nuclear import of hTERT, thereby resulting in increased telomerase activity. These data provide details of a binding mechanism that enables hTERT to interact with the nuclear import receptors and of the control of the dynamic nuclear transport of hTERT through phosphorylation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3882,pos_MEDLINE,0.99650973,1
26004069,"Structural Insights into Bunyavirus Replication and Its Regulation by the vRNA Promoter. SUMMARY. Segmented negative-strand RNA virus (sNSV) polymerases transcribe and replicate the viral RNA (vRNA) within a ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP). We present cryo-EM and X-ray structures of, respectively, apo- and vRNA bound La Crosse orthobunyavirus (LACV) polymerase that give atomic-resolution insight into how such RNPs perform RNA synthesis. The complementary 3′ and 5′ vRNA extremities are sequence specifically bound in separate sites on the polymerase. The 5′ end binds as a stem-loop, allosterically structuring functionally important polymerase active site loops. Identification of distinct template and product exit tunnels allows proposal of a detailed model for template-directed replication with minimal disruption to the circularised RNP. The similar overall architecture and vRNA binding of monomeric LACV to heterotrimeric influenza polymerase, despite high sequence divergence, suggests that all sNSV polymerases have a common evolutionary origin and mechanism of RNA synthesis. These results will aid development of replication inhibitors of diverse, serious human pathogenic viruses. INTRODUCTION. Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Orthomyxoviridae, the principal families of segmented negative single-stranded RNA viruses (sNSV), each include serious human pathogens such as Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, and influenza viruses, respectively. Orthomyxoviruses have six to eight genome segments, whereas Bunyaviridae (reviewed in Elliott, 2014) have three, and Arenaviridae two. For each segment, transcription, generating capped viral mRNAs, and replication, generating full-length genome or antigenome copies (vRNA and cRNA, respectively), are performed by the same virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). For arena- and bunyaviruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm, the RdRp is the single-chain L protein, whereas for orthomyxoviruses, which replicate in the nucleus, it is a hetero-trimeric complex, formed by the PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits (Fodor, 2013; Guu et al., 2012; Morin et al., 2013; te Velthuis, 2014). vRNA genome segments are always packaged by multiple copies of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) together with one copy of the RdRp into filamentous ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), which are the functional replication and transcription units (Reguera et al., 2014). sNSV polymerases have two unique features. First, they perform transcription by the “cap-snatching” mechanism, whereby short 5′ capped RNA fragments are cleaved from host cell mRNA by an endonuclease intrinsic to the RdRp and then used to prime synthesis of viral mRNAs (Morin et al., 2010; Plotch et al., 1981; Reguera et al., 2010; Reich et al., 2014). Second, they recognize each genome segment via their highly conserved, quasi-complementary 3′ and 5′ extremities (over a length of 13–19 nucleotides), known as the promoter (Barr and Wertz, 2004). Correlated with this, sNSV RNPs are generally circularized, which is thought to occur by base pairing between the genome ends (forming a double-stranded “panhandle”) and/or the simultaneous binding of both ends to the polymerase (Reguera et al., 2014). vRNA promoter binding to influenza polymerase was visualized recently for the first time in a co-crystal structure. This revealed that each vRNA extremity binds sequence specifically as a single strand to distinct sites on the polymerase but then come together to form a short duplex of about four base pairs (Pflug et al., 2014). Furthermore, this mode of promoter binding is required for activation of diverse influenza polymerase functions (Fodor, 2013). For bunyaviruses, exact self-complementarity of the genome ends extends for 15–19 nts (except for only one G-U mismatch in the case of orthobunyaviruses [Barr and Wertz, 2004; Kohl et al., 2004]), potentially allowing formation of a much more stable panhandle than for influenza vRNA. However, the exact nature of the vRNA-vRNA and vRNA-L interactions that circularize bunyavirus RNPs are not known. Cross linking suggests that the vRNA ends within bunyavirus RNPs are base paired at least partially (Raju and Kolakofsky, 1989) and a distal duplex region is essential for RNA synthesis by bunyavirus (Barr and Wertz, 2004; Kohl et al., 2004) and arenavirus (Kranzusch et al., 2010) polymerases. The absence of significant sequence similarity, outside of the cap-snatching endonuclease (Reguera et al., 2010) and the conserved RdRp motifs (Müller et al., 1994), between Arenaviridae and Bunyaviridae L proteins and Orthomyxoviridae heteotrimeric polymerases also poses the question as to whether all sNSV have a structurally and evolutionary conserved architecture to match their functional similarity. To answer this question and those related to promoter binding, we determined the crystal structure of 77% of the L protein from La Crosse orthobunyavirus (LACV) in complex with just the 3′ or both 3′ and 5′ conserved genomic RNA ends and the cryo-EM structure of the apo-form. LACV is a potentially serious but rare, mosquito-transmitted human pathogen that causes 50–100 cases of encephalitis per year in the USA (http://www.cdc.gov/lac/) (Elliott, 2014; Haddow and Odoi, 2009). The structure reveals high similarity, but also interesting differences, to the equivalent influenza complex (Pflug et al., 2014; Reich et al., 2014). In particular, it shows the structural basis of the specific recognition of the vRNA 3′ end, the allosteric regulation mediated by vRNA 5′ end binding, and the likely path of the template into the polymerase active site cavity and out again. These findings, combined with those gained from the influenza polymerase structures, provide new insight into the common mechanism of action, the conserved features, and the diversity among sNSV polymerases.

26051119,"Signal-sequence induced conformational changes in the signal recognition particle. The signal recognition particle (SRP) co-translationally targets proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum in eurkaryotes or to the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. As the initiating step, SRP binds to the N-terminal signal sequence of nascent secretory or membrane proteins as they emerge from the ribosome. The SRP–ribosome nascent chain complex (RNC) is then targeted to the membrane through a GTP-dependent interaction with the SRP receptor (SR). The signal sequence is released from SRP and inserted into the translocon channel. Finally, GTP hydrolysis triggers the dissociation of SRP from SR, and SRP can start another cycle of protein targeting (for review see ref 1, 2). SRP composition varies in the three domains of life. However, the evolutionary conserved SRP core only comprises the SRP54 protein (termed Ffh in bacteria) bound to the coaxial stacked helices 5 and 8 of SRP RNA. It is this SRP core that carries out the key functions of signal sequence recognition and SR interaction. SRP54 comprises an N-terminal NG domain and a C-terminal methionine-rich M domain. The NG domain contains the GTPase activity and interacts with SR34. The M domain anchors SRP54 onto the SRP RNA and contains the signal sequence binding site5678. The NG and M domains are connected by a long and flexible GM linker that allows for rearrangements of the relative positions of the M and NG domains691011121314. Biochemical studies show that the binding of a signal sequence to the M domain accelerates GTP-independent interaction between the NG domain and SR at the helix 8 tetraloop1516. This ‘early' complex undergoes a GTP-dependent structural change that results in a ‘closed' and stable complex. Large-scale rearrangement of the closed complex to helix 5 leads to GTPase activation and signal sequence release11161718. The essential SRP RNA functions as a scaffold to mediate the rearrangements; it is also required for efficient GTPase activation1117. SRP-dependent N-terminal signal sequences are highly diverse in amino-acid composition and length, but they all contain a core of at least eight consecutive hydrophobic amino acids that acts as the major determinant for recognition by SRP1920. In addition, the N-terminus of a signal sequence typically contains positively charged residues with an as yet unknown function. Two crystal structures of archaeal SRP54-signal sequence fusion proteins have provided the first detailed views of the M domain-signal sequence interaction. The M domain contains five amphipathic α-helices (αM1-5) and includes a ‘finger loop' between αM1 and αM2 (ref. 7). Different orientations of the signal sequence are seen in the crystal structures. In Sulfolobus solfataricus SRP54 complexed with the signal sequence of yeast dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B (DPAP-B)5, the signal sequence binds into a groove formed by αM1, αM2 and αM5; it is positioned roughly antiparallel to αM5. For the complex of Methanococcus jannaschii SRP54 and a signal sequence mimic6, the signal sequence is positioned perpendicular to αM5. There it is bound in a shallow groove formed by the αM1, αM5 and GM linker helix (Supplementary Fig. 1). A major drawback of both crystallographic models is that the SRP54 M domain is complexed with a signal sequence from a different SRP54 protein in the asymmetric unit. This results in a non-physiological SRP54 dimerization, both in solution and in the crystals56. Communication between the M and NG domains is critical for SRP function. During protein targeting, the binding of a signal sequence in the M domain must be effectively transmitted to the NG domain to accelerate its interaction with SR. The molecular mechanism by which the signal sequence stimulates NG domain–SR complex assembly is currently not understood. To address this, we performed structural studies on M. jannaschii SRP and its interaction with signal sequences. Here we report the crystal structure of a monomeric SRP, including the full-length (fl) M domain in complex with a signal sequence. This structure shows how signal sequence binding in the M domain is directly linked to NG domain repositioning via an induced helix formation of the GM linker. RESULTS. THE FULL-LENGTH SRP54-SIGNAL SEQUENCE FUSION IS MONOMERIC. The amino-acid sequence C-terminal to αM5 in the M domain varies between species in length and composition, but is found in all SRP54 proteins21. On the basis of cross-linking22 and cryoelectron microscopy studies14, the C-terminal residues are suggested to play a role in signal sequence binding. These residues, which are deleted in most SRP54 constructs used for crystallization, are flexible in the crystal structure of the free Pyrococcus furiosus SRP54 (ref. 23). The SRP54 proteins in the crystal structures of the SRP54-signal sequence fusions (SRP54-ss)56 also lack the residues located C-terminal to the αM5. We hypothesized that the reported dimerization of SRP54-ss56 is caused by the absence of the C-terminal aliphatic sequence. To verify this, we cloned and expressed the full-length (fl) SRP54 protein from M. jannaschii (aa1-451) fused to a strongly hydrophobic, idealized signal sequence comprising 14 leucine and alanine residues624 (Fig. 1a). The SRP54 C-terminus and the signal sequence were separated in the protein construct by a 9-aa long glycine/serine linker to allow the signal sequence to properly bind to the M domain. The fl-SRP54-ss protein was identical to the previously reported SRP54-ss protein6 except for the inclusion of the 20 C-terminal amino acids of M. jannaschii SRP54. Size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that fl-SRP54-ss, but not SRP54-ss6, was monomeric in solution (Supplementary Fig. 2). The presence of a signal sequence accelerates SRP–SR interaction and consequently produces an apparent stimulatory effect on the GTPase reaction of the SRP–SR complex616242526. To test functionality of fl-SRP54-ss we reconstituted M. jannaschii SRP core complexes comprising SRP54, SRP19 and SRP RNA. As expected,",PMC,pos,1,pos,3898,pos_PMC,0.99738365,1
26095357,"Structural and Functional Analysis of the GADD34:PP1 eIF2α Phosphatase. SUMMARY. The attenuation of protein synthesis via the phosphorylation of eIF2α is a major stress response of all eukaryotic cells. The Growth Arrest and DNA-damaged protein 34 (GADD34) bound to the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is the necessary eIF2α phosphatase complex that returns mammalian cells to normal protein synthesis following stress. The molecular basis by which GADD34 recruits PP1 and its substrate eIF2α are not fully understood, hindering our understanding of the remarkable selectivity of the GADD34:PP1 phosphatase for eIF2α. Here we report detailed structural and functional analyses of the GADD34:PP1 holoenzyme and its recruitment of eIF2α. The data highlight independent interactions of PP1 and eIF2α with GADD34, demonstrating that GADD34 functions as a scaffold both in vitro and in cells. This work greatly enhances our molecular understanding of a major cellular eIF2α phosphatase and establishes the foundation for future translational work. INTRODUCTION. Protein synthesis in eukaryotes is actively controlled via the reversible phosphorylation of numerous translation initiation and elongation factors. In this context, the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF2 (eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2), a trimeric complex composed α, β and γ subunits, is a pivotal down-regulator of translation initiation following changes in the cellular environment or stress (Walton and Gill, 1976). Under non-stressed conditions, eIF2α is largely unphosphorylated. In the presence of GTP, the eIF2 complex recruits Met-tRNA and ribosomal subunits to the translation start site to initiate mRNA translation. However, stresses, such as nutrient deprivation, heat shock, among other factors, activate one or more of four protein kinases, namely GCN2, PERK, PKR and HRI to phosphorylate eIF2α on a single serine, temporarily repressing general protein synthesis (Harding et al., 2000). Some mRNAs are, however, preferentially translated following eIF2α phosphorylation. These include mRNAs encoding the transcription factors, ATF4 and CHOP, which together induce the stress response gene that encodes Growth Arrest and DNA-damaged protein 34 (GADD34; protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A, PPP1R15A). As the stress declines, the GADD34 protein, by recruiting the ser/thr protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), facilitates the dephosphorylation of phospho-eIF2α, restoring normal protein synthesis (Connor et al., 2001; Novoa et al., 2001). The structural basis by which the GADD34:PP1 complex functions as an eIF2α phosphatase remains unclear. GADD34 (674 residues, 73.5 kDa) possesses an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting helix, four central PEST repeats and a C-terminal PP1-binding domain (Fig. 1A). Bioinformatics analyses suggest that GADD34 is largely unstructured (Fig. S1), making it impossible to assign function(s) simply by analysis of its primary structure. Phylogenetic analyses point to the existence of GADD34-like proteins in many multicellular organisms, from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans (Ceulemans et al., 2002). While some lower eukaryotes, like Drosophila, possess a single gene encoding dGADD34, mammals possess two genes encoding GADD34 and CReP (PPP1R15B) that share sequence homology solely in the C-terminal PP1-binding domain (Chen et al., 2015; Jousse et al., 2003). Finally, viral infection often results in PKR-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation, which inhibits protein synthesis and viral replication in the infected host cells. However, the genomes of selected poxviruses encode polypeptides, like ICP34.5 (also known as γ34.5), with sequence homology to the PP1–binding domain of GADD34 (He et al., 1997). By recruiting PP1, ICP34.5 promotes eIF2α dephosphorylation allowing these viruses to evade this host cell surveillance mechanism. Together, these data argued that the approximately 100 amino acids encompassing the conserved PP1-binding domain among distinct eIF2α phosphatases contain the critical determinants that direct eIF2α dephosphorylation. Recent discoveries of small molecular inhibitors, namely Salubrinal (Boyce et al., 2005) and Guanabenz (Tsaytler et al., 2011), which target eIF2α phosphatases showed that they protected cells from cytotoxic cell death resulting from protein misfolding and aggregation (known as proteotoxicity). Indeed both compounds improved symptoms and prolonged life in animal models of human neurodegenerative diseases (Jiang et al., 2014; Saxena et al., 2009). Interestingly, Salubrinal inhibited the mammalian GADD34 and CReP-containing eIF2α phosphatases as well as the ICP34.5-containing viral phosphatase. By contrast, Guanabenz showed greater selectivity for the GADD34-containing eIF2α phosphatases. On the other hand, Guanabenz prevented prion protein aggregation and toxicity in both yeast and mammalian cells (Tribouillard-Tanvier et al., 2008). This is particularly remarkable as Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not express a GADD34 ortholog. Instead, the yeast eIF2γ subunit contains an N-terminal extension containing a PP1-binding RVxF motif that directly recruits PP1 (Glc7p) and catalyzes eIF2α dephosphorylation (Rojas et al., 2014). Thus, there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the structure of mammalian eIF2α phosphatases and the mode of action of inhibitors to facilitate the future development of therapies against human diseases associated with proteotoxicity. Here, we utilized NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, biochemistry and cell biology to elucidate how GADD34 binds PP1 and recruits its substrate, eIF2α. The crystal structure of the GADD34:PP1 holoenzyme (the complex between PP1 and the PP1-binding domain of GADD34) shows that GADD34 uses both the RVxF and ΦΦ motifs to bind PP1. We also show that the selectivity for eIF2α as substrate is greatly enhanced by its binding to one or more of the central PEST domains in GADD34. The data establish that GADD34 functions as a scaffold, utilizing distinct domains to recruit PP1 and eIF2α in vitro and",PMC,pos,1,pos,3908,pos_PMC,0.9978677,1
26110759,"Structural and Functional Analysis of Human HtrA3 Protease and Its Subdomains. INTRODUCTION. Human HtrA3, a proapoptotic protein, is a member of the HtrA (high temperature requirement A) family of homo-oligomeric serine proteases, which are well conserved in evolution and whose primary function is to maintain protein quality control. Their common structural features are the presence of the chymotrypsin-like protease domain (PD) and at least one PDZ (post-synaptic density 95, Drosophila discs large, zona occludens-1) domain localized at the C-terminus. The N-terminus is variable and it may contain signal and regulatory sequences. The common structural unit of the HtrA proteases is a pyramid-shaped trimer consisting of PDs, which form the central core, and outward-protruding PDZ domains. In some HtrAs, for example in the Escherichia coli HtrA(DegP) and DegQ, this trimeric unit may further oligomerize, forming hexamers, dodecamers, or icosatetramers [1] [2] [3]. Crystal structures of several HtrAs have been solved, including the E. coli HtrA(DegP) [1] [4], DegS [5] [6] and DegQ [2]; Legionella falloni DegQ [7]; Mycobacterium tuberculosis HtrA2 [8] and the human HtrA1 (PD and N-terminal domain) [9] [10], HtrA2 [11], and HtrA3 PDZ [12]. There are also two NMR structures of the HtrA1 PDZ domain available [12]. Substrate binding may lead to the formation of higher order oligomers and activation [3] [9] [13]. On the other hand, the loss of oligomeric structure may lead to inactivation, as in the case of human HtrA2 [11] [14]. PDZ domains have been shown to act as regulatory elements and as substrate specificity determinants [2] [15] [16] [17]. They bind the hydrophobic stretches of misfolded substrate (or regulatory) polypeptides, leading to structural changes in PDs and enzyme activation. In spite of the structural similarity of PDZ domains observed among HtrA proteases, their impact on activity varies: they may be indispensable for activity, as in the case of E. coli HtrA(DegP) PDZ1 [18], or dispensable, as in human HtrA1 [9]. The PDZ domains may also participate in oligomer formation (reviewed in [19]). HtrA3 was initially identified in the developing placenta as a serine protease associated with pregnancy [20] [21] [22] [23]. Dysregulation of HtrA3 has been observed in a number of diseases including cancer [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] and preeclampsia [31] [32]. Downregulation of HtrA3 was associated with the progression of endometrial and ovarian cancer [26] [27] [28] [29]. HtrA3 downregulation in lung cancer results in resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments with etoposide and cisplatin. HtrA3 is involved in the induction of the intrinsic, mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Upon treatment with cytotoxic agents, HtrA3 is released from the mitochondrium into the cytosol, where it triggers apoptosis via its serine protease activity [24] [25]. HtrA3 is thus proposed to be a tumor suppressor and a potential therapeutic target in the cancer treatment [25] [33]. HtrA3 has two isoforms, long (HtrA3L) and short (HtrA3S), resulting from alternative mRNA splicing [21]. The long isoform of HtrA3 (HtrA3L) is a 49-kDa protein that contains a signal secretory peptide at the N-terminus (residues 1–17), a domain with homology to the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP) (residues 29–94) and a Kazal-type inhibitor motif (KI) (residues 89–126) followed by a serine protease domain (PD) with the catalytic triad H191-D227-S305 and one PDZ domain at the C-terminal end. In contrast to HtrA3L, the 39-kDa short isoform of HtrA3 (HtrA3S) lacks the PDZ domain. In place of the PDZ domain it has a stretch of seven amino acids (APSLAVH) at the C-terminus, which is unique for this isoform and is encoded by a separate exon [21]. The function of this structural element is not known. Both variants of HtrA3 are widely expressed in the human body with variable levels in different organs [21]. The HtrA3 proteins undergo autocleavage of the N-terminal region containing the IGFBP and KI motifs [24] [34] [35] [36]. The autocatalytic cleavage of the N-terminal domain from HtrA3L is necessary for mitochondrial to cytoplasmic translocation of the protease and increased cell death. Both the full length (residues 18–453) and N-terminally-truncated (residues ~ 130–453) forms of HtrA3L exist in vivo [25] [36]. The N-terminal domain is not required for the protease activity. Its deletion causes an effect similar to that observed for HtrA1 (~ 3-fold activity increase) [34]. Despite the physiological importance of HtrA3, little is known about its structure and function at the molecular level. Only the structure of the PDZ domain of HtrA3 has been determined by X-ray crystallography [12]. The oligomerization status of HtrA3 and the role of the PDZ domain for oligomer formation are still unknown. Also, the biochemical properties of HtrA3 are not well characterized. In this paper we studied the N-terminally truncated form of HtrA3L, comprising the PD-PDZ region; here after referred to as ΔN-HtrA3. The purpose of the study was to solve the crystal structure of ΔN-HtrA3, assess the ΔN-HtrA3 oligomerization status in solution, and characterize its enzymatic activity, focusing on the role of the PDZ domain in proteolysis and structure formation. To complement these studies and to assess the role of the unique C-terminal stretch of seven amino acids of HtrA3S, the activity and oligomerization status of an N-terminally truncated HtrA3S (ΔN-HtrA3S) was also tested. The crystal structure of recombinant HtrA3 purified from bacterial cells containing two domains, PD and PDZ (ΔN-HtrA3S305A, residues 130–453), at a resolution of 3.27 Å was determined. The S305A mutation eliminated the serine protease activity causing partial degradation of the ΔN-HtrA3 protein and thus assured a high level of homogeneity for preparations. The structure showed that ΔN-HtrA3 forms a trimer with PDs essentially similar to those of HtrA1 and HtrA2. We found that both ΔN-HtrA3-ΔPDZ and ΔN-HtrA3S were fully active compared to",PMC,pos,1,pos,3912,pos_PMC,0.99762183,1

The self-processing module (SPM) is an internal segment of the FrpC protein (P415-F591) secreted by the pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium Neisseria meningitidis during meningococcal infection of human upper respiratory tract. SPM mediates 'protein trans-splicing', a unique natural mechanism for editing of proteins, which involves a calcium-dependent autocatalytic cleavage of the peptide bond between D414 and P415 and covalent linkage of the cleaved fragment through its carboxy-terminal group of D414 to [Formula: see text]-amino group of lysine residue within a neighboring polypeptide chain.

26186291,"Crystal Structure of a Transcribing RNA Polymerase II Complex Reveals a Complete Transcription Bubble. SUMMARY. Notwithstanding numerous published structures of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), structural details of Pol II engaging a complete nucleic acid scaffold have been lacking. Here, we report the structures of TFIIF stabilized transcribing Pol II complexes, revealing the upstream duplex and full transcription bubble. The upstream duplex lies over a wedge-shaped loop from Rpb2 that engages its minor groove, providing part of the structural framework for DNA tracking during elongation. At the upstream transcription bubble fork, rudder and fork loop-1 residues spatially coordinate strand annealing and the nascent RNA transcript. At the downstream fork, a network of Pol II interactions with the non-template strand forms a rigid domain with the Trigger Loop (TL), allowing visualization of its open state. Overall, our observations suggest that “open/closed” conformational transitions of the TL may be linked to interactions with the non-template strand, possibly in a synchronized ratcheting manner conducive to polymerase translocation. INTRODUCTION. The pre-initiation stage of transcription requires concerted interactions between RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) and the general transcription factors TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIF, TFIIE and TFIIH. During initial promoter melting TFIIH generates an unwound region of 7–9 base pairs. Subsequently, this transcription bubble is unwound to approximately 18–25 bases and a short DNA-RNA hybrid is synthesized. Transcripts of 10 or more nucleotides result in promoter escape and stabilization of a mature bubble (Liu et al., 2011; Luse, 2012; Nechaev and Adelman, 2011). The number of nucleotides unwound in a mature bubble is still a matter of debate since sizes ranging from 8–22 nucleotides have been reported for bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic polymerases (Fiedler and Timmers, 2001; Naryshkin et al., 2000; Pal et al., 2005). In addition, the size of the bubble might not be fixed but depend on Pol II’s transcriptional stage; evidence of a scrunched state –where template and non-template strand bases are compacted in space relative to relaxed conformations– has been proposed for the early stages of transcription initiation in bacteria (Kapanidis et al., 2006; Revyakin et al., 2006). Similarly, other transcriptional events such as backtracking or interactions with elongation or termination factors might alter the number of bases (and location) in the mature bubble (Fiedler and Timmers, 2001). Notwithstanding numerous Pol II structures published to date, structural details of a complete transcribing complex including upstream and downstream DNA duplexes and a full transcription bubble have yet to be revealed. Here we report the crystal structures of Pol II in complex with a complete nucleic acid scaffold that illustrates the architecture of a Pol II transcribing complex. RESULTS. DESIGN, ASSEMBLY, AND CRYSTALLIZATION OF POL II TRANSCRIBING COMPLEXES. Assembly of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol II transcribing complex was achieved by mixing Pol II with pre-assembled nucleic acid scaffolds (see experimental section). The main scaffold used for our experiments (scaffold 1) consisted of two synthetic DNA oligonucleotides (53-nucleotides long), featuring upstream and downstream duplexes, a non-complementary stretch of 15 nucleotides to generate a synthetic transcription bubble, and a 9-mer RNA complementary to the template strand to form a DNA-RNA hybrid (Fig. S1A). The number of non-complementary bases used in the design of the bubble was based on crystal structures of partial Pol II transcribing complexes including PDB:IDs 1Y1W and 2NVZ (Kettenberger et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2006). These structures show at the downstream end, base complementarity at positions i+3 and i+5, respectively (where i+1 indicates the nucleotide addition site and i-1 the first base of the nascent RNA transcript), and at the upstream end, a partial template strand reaches position i-9 below arch residues (comprising rudder (Rpb1312–319) and fork loop 1 (FL1, Rpb2470–480)) (Fig. S1B). However, steric clashes with arch residues at this position suggested that at least two additional nucleotides are required to allow template and non-template strand annealing. Collectively, these observations suggested an artificial bubble size with a minimum of 14 nucleotides for in vitro structural studies of a transcribing Pol II. Initially, crystals of Pol II bound to our scaffolds showed weak electron density for the upstream duplex but none for the non-template strand (Fig. S1C). In search for factors that could contribute to a stabilized transcription bubble, we assembled Pol II or 10-subunit Pol II (lacking Rpb4 and Rpb7 subunits, Δ4/7) transcribing complexes with TFIIF or its 45 kDa β-subunit, Tfg2 (Fig. S1D,E). Two sets of crystals were obtained using PEG 4000 and low salt (Table 1). The first transcribing complex comprises Δ4/7-TFIIF (heretofore referred as Δ4/7-TC for simplicity) and the second comprises Pol II-Tfg2 (heretofore referred as Pol II-TC). Structures were solved by molecular replacement in Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007) using Δ4/7 or Pol II as search models (see experimental procedures). An initial unbiased Fobs-Fcalc map revealed the presence of extra density corresponding to upstream dsDNA, the non-template strand (Figs. 1A) and three previously disordered regions of Rpb2 (Fig. S2A,B). Unfortunately, any additional density for Tfg2 or TFIIF was non-interpretable due to either high mobility or partial occupancy in the crystals. Nevertheless, the presence of TFIIF within the crystals (Fig. S1F) was essential to reveal the full structure of the transcription bubble in our complexes. Interestingly, low resolution cryo-EM data of the pre-initiation complex suggests a role of TFIIF, or the Tfg2 winged-helix domain specifically, in stabilizing the upstream duplex, which could not be visualized prior to TFIIF addition within these structures (He et al., 2013; Muhlbacher et al., 2014).

26211992,"Raman spectral classification of mineral- and collagen-bound water's associations to elastic and post-yield mechanical properties of cortical bone. INTRODUCTION. Skeletal fragility due to the aging and disease (i.e., osteoporosis, osteopetrosis and osteopenia) is a major social-health problem affecting the lives of millions of people.( Accurate assessment of fracture risk would help timely inception of therapy or help avoid unnecessary treatments. Bone mineral density (BMD)-based diagnosis cannot assess bone fragility with high accuracy ( and there is a need for more accurate diagnostic techniques. To address this need, a refined assessment of fracture risk independently of BMD would be valuable. Recent years have seen the elucidation of the water portion of bone in terms of its effects on bone’s fracture resistance.( In this perspective, clear understanding the involvement of water to bone’s mechanical integrity could be central to this effort and would contribute to the improvement fracture risk assessment. Water is an abundant component of bone, up to 20% of trabecular bone ( and approximately 10% of cortical bone’s wet weight is water.( Water in bone mainly exists in three different forms: (i) structural (molecular) water as part of the collagen and mineral structure; (ii) unbound water within the microscopic pores (Haversian canals, canaliculi, and lacunae spaces)(, and (iii) water that is bound to the collagen ( and mineral ( surfaces of bone. While only about 20% of the total water in bone exists in the unbound state, the majority of the water is bound to bone matrix.( Distribution of unbound and bound water amount is a function of gender, disease, and age; and is also associated with collagen cross-linking, in the degree of mineralization of bone, and porosity as well.( While total water content shows an inverse relationship with mineral content of bone (, bone matrix density is associated with bound water concentration.(. Despite known effects of dehydration on dried bone mechanical properties (, the exact function and contribution of different water compartments to bone mechanical integrity is not fully understood since bound water is an elusive variable to be measured nondestructively. The only nondestructive method used for studying bone hydration status is magnetic resonance variants (NMR or MRI). The assignment of the data obtained from MR-based techniques to specific water compartments of bone is phenomenological and implicit. NMR-based techniques require ultrahigh-quality NMR data for accurate estimation of the water compartments in bone.( MR-based techniques mostly detect signal from water bound to organic matrix (e.g., collagen) and unbound water (, but they do not provide information on water that is bound to mineral exclusively. These techniques are not also able to distinguish among the bound water compartments that have various energy levels.( Few studies investigated the effects of unbound and bound water on bone mechanical properties using MR-based techniques.( To date, the correlations of bound water to bone mechanical properties have not been investigated by a secondary method other than MR-based techniques. Furthermore, the contribution of water bound to mineral or water compartments which are bound to collagen with different energy levels are not investigated. Therefore, a broader range of methods are needed to infer the status of water compartments that may independently a role in contributing to bone mechanical properties. Raman spectroscopy is one of the few nondestructive modalities to assess the hydration status in bone. Raman spectroscopy can provide unique information on the type of water with various energy levels and the moiety to which water molecules are bound to (. Raman spectroscopy has not been used to study the OH-stretch band in bone since the commercial Raman systems lack sensitivity into the OH-stretch range. Recently, we developed a custom designed short-wave infrared (SWIR) Raman spectroscopy system to identify the water compartments of bone with the moiety to which water molecules are bound to.( Using SWIR Raman spectroscopy, we previously identified four peaks in OH-stretch band of bone that were sensitive to sequential dehydration (: the first peak is at 3220 cm−1 and belongs to solely organic matrix-related water (mostly collagen-related water), the second peak at 3325 cm−1 belongs to NH groups in collagen (backbone of collagen) beside organic matrix-related water (mostly collagen-related water), the third one at 3453 cm−1 belongs to OH of hydroxyproline (Hyp) beside mostly collagen-related water, and the last one at 3584 cm−1 belongs to OH of mineral and mineral-related water (Fig. 1). Among these four peaks, we found that 3325 and 3584 cm−1 were more tightly bound to the matrix than the remaining bands based on the rate at which they were replaced by deuterium oxide (D20). Using these four peaks, we developed four new spectroscopic biomarkers: I3220/I2949, I3325/I2949 and I3453/I2949 reflect status of mostly collagen-related water compartments and collagen portion of bone while I3584/I2949 reflects status of mineral-related water compartments and mineral portion of bone. This knowledge lent itself to the investigation of the association of these peak ratio intensities with bone mechanical properties. The purpose of the current study was to assess the association between these new spectroscopic biomarkers and bone mechanical properties as a potential predictive of bone quality in terms of bone hydration. Specifically, using these new spectroscopic biomarkers, we aimed to assess contributions of different water compartments in bone to elastic and post-yield mechanical properties of bone. METHODS. 2.1.

The combined structural and biochemical data of this 12-subunit complex reveal how a single-stranded RNA can reach the Rrp44 or Rrp6 active sites directly or can bind Rrp6 and be threaded via the central channel towards the distal RNase Rrp44. When a bulky RNA is stalled at the entrance of the channel, Rrp6-Rrp47 swings open.

26274530,"Electrochemotherapy to Metastatic Spinal Melanoma: A Novel Treatment of Spinal Metastasis?. STUDY DESIGN Preliminary report of new antitumor treatment. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy as a novel treatment of spinal metastasis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Electrochemotherapy is a new antitumor treatment that combines systemic bleomycin with electric pulses delivered locally at the tumor site. These electric pulses permeabilize cell membranes in the tissue, allow bleomycin delivery diffusion inside the cells, and increase bleomycin cytotoxicity. Previous clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy in the treatment of several primary and metastatic solid tumors. METHODS Treatment planning for electrode positioning and electrical pulse parameters was prepared for 4 needle electrodes. Mini-open surgery with a left L5 laminectomy was performed to introduce the eletrodes. The patient was treated according to the established Electrochemotherapy Protocol with Bleomycin. Clinical efficacy of electrochemotherapy was evaluated according to a visual analog scale of pain, Oswestry Disability Index 2.0, the Karnofsky Performance Scale, and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. RESULTS The assessed follow-up period was 48 months after the electrochemotherapy procedure. Neither serious electrochemotherapy-related adverse events, nor bleomycin toxicity were reported. Overall improvement in pain according to Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 and Karnofsky Performance Scale outcomes was better. CONCLUSION Our case represents, to our knowledge, the first one to test the potential role of electrochemotherapy as treatment of spinal metastasis. Electrochemotherapy allowed a successful treatment of metastatic spinal melanoma. However, we believe that there is a strong scientific rationale to support the potential utility of electrochemotherapy as a novel treatment of spinal metastasis, regardless of the histological types.

26280335,"An atomic structure of human γ-secretase. A hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is accumulation of β-amyloid plaque in patient brain. The intramembrane protease γ-secretase is thought to contribute to AD development by generating β-amyloid peptides, particularly those that are prone to aggregation such as Aβ42. A mature γ-secretase consists of four components: presenilin, Pen-2, nicastrin, and Aph-1. Among these components, presenilin is responsible for the Aβ-producing proteolytic activity. Presenilin comprises 9 TMs, with the signature motifs YD on TM6 and GxGD on TM7. During assembly of γ-secretase, presenilin undergoes an autocatalytic cleavage to produce an N-terminal fragment (NTF, comprising TMs 1-6) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF, comprising TMs 7-9). Among the 300 or so mutations derived from patients with familial AD (FAD), more than two thirds are mapped to PS1, and about three dozen each are derived from PS2 and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Nicastrin contains a large ECD and a single TM; its ECD is heavily glycosylated and thought to recognize the N-terminus of substrate protein. Pen-2 directly binds PS1 and is required for its autocatalytic maturation and protease activity. Aph-1 contains 7 TMs and is indispensable for γ-secretase assembly. Our previous cryo-EM structure of human γ-secretase at 4.5 Å resolution led to identification of 19 TMs and construction of a partial atomic model for the ECD. Analysis of the crystal structures of the archaeal presenilin homologue PSH and the nicastrin homologue from Dictyostelium purpureum (DpNCT) yielded a tantalizing clue on TM assignment and an improved atomic model for the ECD. A subsequent cryo-EM structure of human γ-secretase at 4.3 Å resolution allowed assignment of all 20 TMs to the four components. In this study, we report the first atomic structure of an intact human γ-secretase, which allows visualization of the atomic structures of all four components and determination of the specific interactions that underlie γ-secretase assembly. STRUCTURE DETERMINATION OF HUMAN Γ-SECRETASE. We performed cryo-EM single-particle analysis on the same sample in amphipols that was used to calculate our previous map. With the aim of reaching higher resolution, we used zero-loss energy-filtered imaging, a higher magnification, and a lower dose rate on the single-electron counting detector (see Methods). We also collected a larger data set. An initial set of 412,272 particle images yielded a 3.5-Å map. Subsequent three-dimensional (3D) classification that was focused on the TMs resulted in a more structurally homogeneous subset of 159,549 particles. This subset was used to calculate the final map at 3.4 Å resolution (Extended Data Figs. 1 & 2). Our map displays excellent main-chain connectivity and side-chain densities for almost all residues (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Twenty TMs were identified in the transmembrane region, including a highly mobile TM (TM2 of PS1) that is only visible as rod-shaped density in a 7 Å low-pass filtered map (Extended Data Fig. 2b). This low-pass filtered map also shows a second rod-shaped density in the PS1 cavity between TM3, TM5, and TM2, which we were unable to identify. As previously reported, PS1 and Aph-1 are located at the center of the TM horseshoe. All seven TMs of Aph-1 have exceptional density, with most side chains clearly identifiable (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Except TM2 and TM6, all other TMs of PS1 exhibit excellent density, with aromatic and bulky residues easily recognizable (Extended Data Fig. 2d). The three TMs of Pen-2 on the thin end of the TM horseshoe and the lone TM of nicastrin on the thick end both display discernible side chain features (Extended Data Figs. 2e, f). A number of N-linked glycans and lipid molecules are also defined by clear EM density (Extended Data Figs. 2g, h). On the basis of these unambiguous EM densities, we built and refined a near-complete atomic model for human γ-secretase (Fig. 1, Extended Data Table 1), which includes 598 residues in the TMs and 632 residues in the ECD. Assignment of specific residues in the TMs was aided by a large number of aromatic amino acids (Extended Data Fig. 2c-f). The density map for PS1-TM2 is inadequate for model building; nonetheless, we generated an atomic model for this TM based on its sequence homology to the archaeal homologue PSH. This is the first structure of human γ-secretase at a near-atomic resolution (Fig. 1; Extended Data Fig. 3). Nicastrin ECD, which constitutes the bulk of the extracellular region of human γ-secretase, contains 11 glycans and directly interacts with two ends of the TM horseshoe (Fig. 1a). The lone TM of nicastrin closely stacks against TM1/TM5/TM7 of Aph-1 through predominantly hydrophobic interactions at the thick end. TM2 and TM4 of Aph-1 associate with TM8 and TM9 of PS1 at the center of the TM horseshoe, with the C-terminal three residues Phe465-Tyr466-Ile467 of PS1 inserting into a greasy central cavity on the extracellular side of Aph-1 (Fig. 1a). The three TMs of Pen-2 bind to TM4 of PS1 at the thin end. Notably, this arrangement places the two catalytic residues, Asp257 and Asp385 of PS1, on the convex side of the TM horseshoe (Fig. 1b). ATOMIC STRUCTURE OF PRESENILIN. PS1 exhibits an extended organization, with empty spaces between a few adjacent TMs (Fig. 2a; Extended Data Fig. 4). The N-terminal 77 residues have no EM density and are presumably disordered, likely due to their intrinsic flexibility. Among the seven surface loops that connect neighboring TMs, four exhibit clear and contiguous density. The extended sequences between TM6 and TM7 harbor the site of autocatalytic cleavage; but these sequences are hydrophilic and mostly disordered (Fig. 2b). The nine TMs exhibit a large variation in length, with TM9 containing 30 residues and TM7 only 18. Among the two catalytic residues, Asp257 is located in the middle of TM6 slightly to the extracellular side, whereas Asp385 maps to the cytoplasmic side of TM7 (Fig. 2b).

26299963,"An Allosteric Interaction Links USP7 to Deubiquitination and Chromatin Targeting of UHRF1. INTRODUCTION. One of the fundamental principles in epigenetic regulation involves temporal and spatial control of macromolecular machineries that govern epigenetic events. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, are recognized by a diverse family of effector proteins (Bogdanovic and Veenstra, 2009; Musselman et al., 2012) whose functions are often subject to dynamic regulation in response to environmental cues. However, how these chromatin effector proteins are regulated remains incompletely understood. UHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING Finger domains, 1), also known as ICBP90 and NP95 in mouse, is a multi-domain protein that plays critical roles in regulating various processes, such as DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1)-mediated DNA methylation maintenance (Bostick et al., 2007; Sharif et al., 2007). UHRF1 contains a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) at the N-terminus, followed by a tandem Tudor domain (TTD), a plant homeodomain (PHD), a SET and RING associated (SRA) domain and a really interesting new gene (RING) domain (Fig. 1A). Among these protein modules, the PHD and TTD domains recognize the N-terminal tail of histone H3 unmethylated at arginine 2 (Hu et al., 2011; Lallous et al., 2011; Rajakumara et al., 2011) and dimethylated/trimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3) (Arita et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2013; Karagianni et al., 2008; Rothbart et al., 2013; Rothbart et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2012), respectively, while the SRA domain specifically binds to hemimethylated CpG sites (Arita et al., 2008; Avvakumov et al., 2008; Bostick et al., 2007; Hashimoto et al., 2008; Sharif et al., 2007). The RING domain of UHRF1 has been shown to serve as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to promote monoubiquitination of H3 at lysine 18 and/or 23 (Nishiyama et al., 2013; Qin et al., 2015), which in turn recruits DNMT1 to replicating chromatin. Despite these advances, the mechanism underlying the regulation of UHRF1 remains to be elucidated. Indeed, emerging evidence has shown that UHRF1 is subject to temporal and spatial control (Gelato et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2012). First, the stability of UHRF1 is regulated by ubiquitination in a cell cycle-dependent manner (Ma et al., 2012). During S-phase, deubiquitinase USP7 (ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 7) associates with UHRF1 keeping it from ubiquitination (Ma et al., 2012). When cells enter mitosis, USP7 dissociates from UHRF1, exposing it for ubiquitination and consequent proteasomal degradation (Ma et al., 2012). Second, the chromatin association of UHRF1 peaks in mid S-phase to accompany pericentromeric heterochromatin replication (Miura et al., 2001; Papait et al., 2007; Taylor et al., 2013), which is likely mediated by a conformational transition between two alternative functional states of UHRF1 (Gelato et al., 2014). In one state, the H3K9me3-binding site of the UHRF1 TTD domain is occluded due to its intramolecular interaction with a C-terminal polybasic region (PBR). In the second state, the TTD domain is relieved from the PBR interaction and thus forms a multivalent histone binding cassette with the PHD domain (Gelato et al., 2014). Binding of the signaling molecule phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P) to the UHRF1 PBR switches the UHRF1 conformation from the TTD-“occluded” state to the TTD-PHD multivalent state, which leads to its increased heterochromatin association (Gelato et al., 2014). However, how networks of interactions functionally regulate UHRF1 in cells remains unresolved. In this study, we characterized the interaction between UHRF1 and USP7 by structure determination of the UHRF1-USP7 complex. Our structural analyses reveal that the UHRF1-USP7 interaction is mediated by the first two UBL domains of USP7 and the PBR of UHRF1. Through functional assays, we show that the interaction of UHRF1 with USP7 is not only critical for its deubiquitination but also disrupts the intramolecular TTD-PBR interaction, thereby shifting the conformation of UHRF1 to promote multivalent histone engagement of the TTD-PHD cassette. Indeed, point mutations that disrupt the USP7 interaction greatly reduce the chromatin association of UHRF1. Our study thus uncovers a novel mechanism by which USP7 promotes both the stability and chromatin association of UHRF1. RESULTS. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE UHRF1-USP7 INTERACTION. A recent study suggests that the interaction between USP7 and UHRF1 is mediated by the Ubiquitin like (UBL) domains of USP7 and a linker region between the SRA and RING finger domains of UHRF1 (residues 600-687, UHRF1600-687) (Fig. 1A) (Ma et al., 2012). To further map the USP7 and UHRF1 interaction interface, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure bindings between truncated USP7 and UHRF1 fragments. The first two UBL domains (UBL1-2) of USP7 interact directly with a fragment of UHRF1 encompassing its SRA and RING domains (residues 419-806, UHRF1SRA-RING), with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.30 μM (Fig. 1B). To narrow this interaction surface further, we showed that the UBL1-2 dual domain of USP7 binds to UHRF1600-687 with a Kd of 1.42 μM (Fig. S1A), and comparable binding activity is observed (Kd = 1.52 μM) when we truncated UHRF1 further to a 32-amino-acid sequence, UHRF1647-678 (Fig. 1B). By contrast, we did not observe appreciable interaction between the first UBL domain (UBL1) of USP7 and UHRF1SRA-RING (Fig. S1B), indicating that UBL1 alone is insufficient for mediating the UHRF1-USP7 interaction. Collectively, these data show that the UHRF1647-678 fragment and the USP7 UBL1-2 domains mediate the UHRF1-USP7interaction. STRUCTURE OF THE UHRF1647-678-USP7 UBL1-3 COMPLEX. Next, to provide the molecular basis for the UHRF1-USP7 interaction, we determined the crystal structure of UHRF1647-678 in complex with the first three UBL domains (UBL1-3) of USP7 at 2.3 Å resolution (Table S1). It is notable that there are two UHRF1-USP7 complexes in each asymmetric unit (Fig. S1C), and in",PMC,pos,1,pos,3975,pos_PMC,0.99344844,1
26304019,"Nuclear Localization of the DNA Repair Scaffold XRCC1: Uncovering the Functional Role of a Bipartite NLS. The localization, complexity and variability of DNA damage requires a complex cellular response that often utilizes scaffold proteins to recruit and coordinate the activities of the individual repair enzymes required to correct the damage. The X-ray cross complementing group 1 protein (XRCC1) is a scaffold that plays important roles in the overlapping single strand break repair (SSBR) and base excision repair (BER) pathways1234, and participates in other repair pathways as well56. In order to coordinate DNA repair events, XRCC1 must be targeted to the nuclear compartment and to sites of DNA damage. Damage targeting of XRCC1 is multifaceted, but one mechanism utilizes a poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR)-dependent recruitment system involving PAR binding by the XRCC1 BRCTa domain789. In addition, PAR-independent mechanisms are also involved101112. The nuclear uptake of XRCC1 is believed to utilize the classical nuclear transport system, however, information about nuclear uptake has been limited and inconsistent. Nuclear import is directed through nuclear localization sequences (NLSs). Classical nuclear localization sequences are either monopartite, consisting of a single cluster of basic residues, or bipartite, consisting of two neighboring clusters of basic residues13. These sequences are recognized by the protein Importin α (Impα), which binds to the NLS of the cargo protein in the cytoplasm, and then translocates it along with Importin β through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus14. A bipartite NLS corresponding to XRCC1 residues 239–266 was initially identified by Masson et al., who demonstrated that this sequence could mediate the nuclear uptake of β-galactosidase8. A subsequent study by Kiriyama et al. fused several variations of the XRCC1 NLS to the repair protein aprataxin in order to effect nuclear uptake. These studies indicated that the minimum segment required for efficient nuclear transport included an additional 10 residues, 239–27615. Computational prediction of potential XRCC1 NLS motifs16 resulted in the identification of two monopartite sequences corresponding to residues 242–250 and 267–276. These two regions are included in the extended NLS identified by Kiriyama et al.15, however, the separation between the two binding motifs is atypically long (Fig. 1). Hence, there is currently some ambiguity regarding the identification and properties of the XRCC1 NLS. Nevertheless, it has become increasingly clear that bipartite NLS signals often include linkers that significantly exceed the 10–12 residues initially identified in such signals131718192021222324. XRCC1 represents a challenging cargo protein for the nuclear import machinery due to its floppy structure that includes two unstructured linker sequences greater than 120 residues in length, as well as its ability to interact with multiple DNA-repair binding partners. Although for most of these binding partners a role of XRCC1 in nuclear uptake is unclear, XRCC1 is apparently required for the co-transport of constitutively bound DNA ligase 3α (Lig3α). Alternative splicing of the Lig3 gene results in both mitochondrial and nuclear forms of Lig3α and germ cell-specific nuclear Lig3β2526. Sequence analysis indicates that Lig3β contains a C-terminal NLS, while Lig3α contains a C-terminal BRCT domain that mediates binding to XRCC1 but lacks an NLS2728. Thus, for the α-form, nuclear uptake is dependent on XRCC1 co-transport. More recently, XRCC1 also has been shown to mediate nuclear translocation of JWA, a microtubule-associated protein involved in activation of MAPK cascades29. In view of these variable results for the XRCC1 NLS and the essential requirement of nuclear localization of XRCC1 in order to fulfill its repair functions as a scaffold protein, we have further investigated the structural basis for the nuclear uptake of this protein. Detailed binding studies of the bipartite NLS peptide, as well as its separate major and minor binding motifs, to both wild-type and mutated forms of Impα reveal pronounced cooperative binding behavior that is due to the tethering of the major and minor motifs. This behavior provides a basis for meeting the intrinsically conflicting high affinity and high flux requirements of an efficient nuclear transport system. RESULTS. STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE XRCC1 NLS COMPLEX WITH IMPORTIN Α. For crystallographic structural analysis of the complex formed between the hXRCC1 nuclear localization sequence and murine Impα(70–529), we selected a peptide that encompasses all of the previously proposed XRCC1 NLS binding motifs (amino acids 241–276). The expectation was that an observed structure would correspond to the most stable complex. It is well known that lattice contacts can influence crystallization, so the peptide length was a potential confounding factor. However, in reported crystal structures, NLS peptides bind to the concave interior surface of the Importin molecule and in general do not appear to be involved in lattice contacts. Hence, intermolecular lattice contact interactions do not appear to play a role in selecting the observed Importin-peptide complex. The Impα(70–529) was chosen because this construct, with the Importin β binding domain (IBB) deleted, is identical to that used in previous crystallography studies by Fontes et al.30. The NLS-binding domain of Impα contains ten armadillo (arm) repeats that are comprised of three helices each, with the exceptions of: “arm 1” that, in our structure, starts just before the second helix; and “arm 5” which consists of only two helices. The hXRCC1 NLS peptide/Impα complex reveals a bipartite NLS in the structure in which residues from both ends of the peptide sequence, G244KRKL and S268VPKRPKLP, occupy the minor and major recognition sites of Impα centered around arm repeats 6–7 and 2–4, respectively (Fig. 2a).

26304557,"Violence against Doctors: The Class Wars. Medical practice is currently at crossroads due to several ills that have crept into the profession. The malaise may have its genesis traced down right from the time of entrance into medical school due at least in part to inadequacy and lack of contemporariness in current medical curricula. There could be several limitations of the medical course at present. The first problem is that rapid technological advances in the practice of medicine have led to an exponential increase in the amount of information and skills that needs to be acquired by the student. Broadly it is a question of dropping vestigial knowledge and re-prioritization of education according to the requirement of the day. The second problem is the alienation of the prospective physician from the society.

26305948,"Structural basis of antizyme-mediated regulation of polyamine homeostasis. Polyamines are organic polycations essential for cell growth and differentiation; their aberrant accumulation is often associated with diseases, including many types of cancer. To maintain polyamine homeostasis, the catalytic activity and protein abundance of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the committed enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis, are reciprocally controlled by the regulatory proteins antizyme isoform 1 (Az1) and antizyme inhibitor (AzIN). Az1 suppresses polyamine production by inhibiting the assembly of the functional ODC homodimer and, most uniquely, by targeting ODC for ubiquitin-independent proteolytic destruction by the 26S proteasome. In contrast, AzIN positively regulates polyamine levels by competing with ODC for Az1 binding. The structural basis of the Az1-mediated regulation of polyamine homeostasis has remained elusive. Here we report crystal structures of human Az1 complexed with either ODC or AzIN. Structural analysis revealed that Az1 sterically blocks ODC homodimerization. Moreover, Az1 binding triggers ODC degradation by inducing the exposure of a cryptic proteasome-interacting surface of ODC, which illustrates how a substrate protein may be primed upon association with Az1 for ubiquitin-independent proteasome recognition. Dynamic and functional analyses further indicated that the Az1-induced binding and degradation of ODC by proteasome can be decoupled, with the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail fragment of ODC being required only for degradation but not binding. Finally, the AzIN-Az1 structure suggests how AzIN may effectively compete with ODC for Az1 to restore polyamine production. Taken together, our findings offer structural insights into the Az-mediated regulation of polyamine homeostasis and proteasomal degradation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,3979,pos_MEDLINE,0.99746895,1
26343456,"The Legionella Anti-autophagy Effector RavZ Targets the Autophagosome via PI3P- and Curvature-Sensing Motifs. SUMMARY. Autophagy is a conserved membrane transport pathway used to destroy pathogenic microbes that access the cytosol of cells. The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila interferes with autophagy by delivering an effector protein, RavZ, into the host cytosol. RavZ acts by cleaving membrane-conjugated Atg8/LC3 proteins from preautophagosomal structures. Its remarkable efficiency allows minute quantities of RavZ to block autophagy throughout the cell. To understand how RavZ targets preautophagosomes and specifically acts only on membrane-associated Atg8 proteins, we elucidated its structure. Revealed is a catalytic domain related in fold to Ulp-family deubiquitinase-like enzymes and a C-terminal PI3P-binding module. RavZ targets the autophagosome via the PI3P-binding module and a catalytic domain helix and preferentially binds high-curvature membranes, intimating localization to highly curved domains in autophagosome intermediate membranes. RavZ-membrane interactions enhance substrate affinity, providing a mechanism for interfacial activation that may also be used by host autophagy proteins engaging only lipidated Atg8 proteins. INTRODUCTION. Macroautophagy is the process in eukaryotic cells whereby unnecessary or damaged intracellular proteins and organelles are sequestered within a membrane-bound compartment, the autophagosome, and then destroyed when the autophagosome matures and fuses with lysosomes (Kuballa et al., 2012; Xie and Klionsky, 2007). Autophagosome biogenesis starts with a cup-shaped precursor membrane, the phagophore, which gradually expands to either selectively or non-selectively enclose cytoplasmic material (Rogov et al., 2014). Proteins in the Atg8/LC3 family of ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) are involved in all stages of autophagosome maturation. Their coupling to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the autophagosome membrane is a critical early step in phagophore biogenesis (Ichimura et al., 2000), and completion of autophagosome formation requires their deconjugation from PE by the papain-like Ubl-deconjugating enzyme Atg4 (Kirisako et al., 2000). Although the protein machinery that orchestrates autophagy has been largely identified, the process remains poorly understood. It is not well-established, for example, from where the phagophore membrane is derived; nor is it clear how the autophagy (atg) proteins are recruited and assembled at the phagophore/autophagosome. Autophagy is also used as a cell-autonomous defense pathway that recognizes intracellular microbes as cargo to be enveloped in an autophagosome and targeted for destruction in an autolysosome (Huang and Brumell, 2014). The bacterium Legionella pneumophila, which causes the severe form of pneumonia known as Legionnaire’s disease, is able to evade detection by the autophagy pathway through the action of the protein RavZ (Choy et al., 2012), one of ~300 effectors that it secretes into the host cell cytoplasm during infection (Huang et al., 2011; Segal, 2013). Like Atg4, RavZ is a protease targeting the Atg8/LC3 protein family, but unlike traditional Ubl-deconjugating enzymes, RavZ does not cleave the peptide bond that was originally formed by the forward Ubl-like reaction (which in this case is the amide bond linking the terminal glycine of Atg8/LC3 and PE) (Choy et al., 2012). Instead, RavZ cleaves the amide bond between the PE-conjugated terminal glycine and the aromatic residue preceding it, thereby rendering Atg8/LC3 resistant to reconjugation (Choy et al., 2012) and thus inhibiting autophagosome maturation. RavZ also differs from Atg4 in targeting exclusively lipidated Atg8 proteins (Choy et al., 2012); as a result it does not interfere with early stages of autophagic membrane growth, when targeting and covalent association of Atg8 family proteins with the growing phagophore are taking place. How RavZ targets and ultimately proteolyzes LC3-PE is not known. Further, how a limited pool of LC3-PE can be recognized in a potential sea of soluble cytoplasmic LC3 is an important general question. A number of host cell autophagy proteins also preferentially engage lipidated LC3, but how this selectivity is achieved is not clear (Behrends et al., 2010; Birgisdottir et al., 2013). Thus, the autophagy inhibitor RavZ is an intriguing system through which to understand autophagosome maturation, including protein targeting to this compartment. The crystal structure of a fragment of RavZ, which we present here, includes several membrane-interaction motifs beyond simple targeting of LC3-PE itself. The crystallized fragment consists of an N-terminal catalytic and a C-terminal domain, which each contribute to autophagosome membrane association. The C-terminal domain includes a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) binding site. PI3P is a phosphoinositide enriched at the autophagosome (Dall’Armi et al., 2013) and residues in the binding site are key in RavZ localization to the autophagosome. The N-terminal domain has a fold similar to the Ubl-specific protease (Ulp) family of cysteine proteases, and in addition to harboring the cysteine protease active site, it features an extended loop with a helix important for membrane association. We find further that RavZ binds more efficiently to highly curved membranes, suggesting that the protein may be preferentially targeted to the rim of the autophagophore cup. Our studies yield clues as to how RavZ is interfacially activated to function only on membranes, thus necessarily limiting its substrate pool to LC3-PE. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. OVERVIEW OF RAVZ STRUCTURE. We used the single anomalous wavelength dispersion technique with selenomethionine substituted crystals (Hendrickson, 1991) to obtain the crystal structure of RavZ at 3.0 Å resolution. The crystallization construct RavZcrystal is active in an Atg8/LC3 delipidation assay ((Choy et al., 2012), Figure 1A-B) and comprises residues 10-458.

26344835,"Effects of Linker Length and Transient Secondary Structure Elements in the Intrinsically Disordered Notch RAM Region on Notch Signaling. INTRODUCTION. The Notch pathway is a conserved signaling pathway in metazoans that is crucial to cell fate determination. Errors in Notch signaling can lead to developmental disorders, adult-onset diseases and cancer. The Notch receptor is a single-pass type I transmembrane receptor. In canonical Notch signaling, association of the extracellular region of the Notch receptor with DSL ligands attached to neighboring cells triggers proteolytic cleavage of the receptor, releasing the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor (NICD) from the membrane (Figure 1). Upon release, NICD translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with the transcription factor CSL (CBF-1/RBP-J, Su(H), Lag-1) and a coactivator protein from the Mastermind family (MAML) to form ternary complexes at the promoters of Notch target genes, such as HES and HEY in mammals. Ternary complex formation activates transcription of Notch target genes by displacing corepressor proteins and by recruiting transcription machinery to the target gene promoters. NICD contains the N-terminal approximately 135-residue intrinsically disordered region referred to as RAM (RBP-j associated molecule) that is followed by seven ankyrin repeats, nuclear localization sequences and a C-terminal PEST degradation sequence (Figure 1). NICD forms a bivalent interaction with CSL through the RAM and ankyrin (ANK) domains. The N-terminus of RAM, centered on the highly conserved ΦWΦP motif, binds with high affinity to the beta-trefoil domain (BTD) of CSL. ANK binds to the other two domains of CSL: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The interaction of ANK with CSL produces a cleft that interacts with the N-terminal helix of MAML to stabilize the ANK:CSL interaction. Compared to commonly studied intrinsically disordered protein (IDP)-mediated interactions, the RAM:CSL interaction is atypical. For some IDPs involved in cell signaling, interaction with a binding partner is coupled to the folding of secondary structure elements within the IDP. In contrast, much of RAM appears to remain disordered when bound to BTD, forming a “fuzzy” complex. Additionally, the interactions of IDPs with their binding partners often have modest affinities, with dissociation constants in the micromolar range. This allows for short-lived interactions that can easily tune signaling output. In contrast, the RAM:CSL interaction has a very high affinity (KD = 22 nM). This high affinity RAM:CSL interaction may be important for displacing corepressor proteins that bind to CSL and suppress transcription. Additionally, the bivalent interaction of NICD with CSL may increase the effective concentration of ANK near the CTD and NTD of CSL to promote ANK:CSL interaction and promote active ternary complex formation. A simple worm-like chain (WLC) polymer statistics model of the linker between RAM and ANK predicts that when RAM is bound to CSL, the effective concentration of ANK at its binding site is maximized when the linker is 80 to 100 residues in length. This length is approximately equal to the lengths of the linker regions of the Notch receptor paralogs. This model also predicts that shortening or lengthening the linker would decrease transcription activity by disrupting ternary complex formation. To test the effective concentration model for bivalent NICD:CSL interaction, we measured transcription activities of NICD variants with sequence insertions and deletions in the RAM region. The activation profile is generally consistent with the WLC model of the disordered linker; however, it deviates from the model for short internal deletions. These deviations are likely due to specific sequence and/or structural elements within the RAM linker. To attempt to identify these elements, we used NMR spectroscopy and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) to structurally characterize the isolated RAM region of NICD. We found several secondary structure elements in the region where short deletions produce variations in transcriptional activation. We tested the importance of these secondary structure elements to Notch signaling and find sensitivity to sequence changes in these regions, but not to secondary structure changes. RESULTS. THE EFFECTS OF INSERTIONS AND DELETIONS IN THE RAM REGION ON NICD TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION. Covalent connection between the N-terminal RAM binding site and ANK domain via the RAM linker has been shown to be important for transcriptional activation and has been proposed to increase the effective concentration of ANK near CSL. For this mechanism, linker length should modulate effective concentration. To test the importance of linker length in Notch signaling, we measured transcription activities of NICD variants containing sequence insertions and deletions in the RAM linker region using a dual-luciferase reporter assay in HeLa cells (Figure 2). The inserted and deleted sequences are distant from the ΦWΦP motif, so direct contacts between RAM and the BTD of CSL should be unaffected. For insertions, the duplicated linker sequence is the segment of the RAM linker with the lowest amount of sequence conservation among Notch homologs to minimize sequence-specific effects. The transcription activities of the RAM insertion and deletion series show maximal transcriptional activation around the wild-type linker length. Activation decreases for both large increases and decreases in linker length. The decrease in activation is gradual as linker length increases, but is quite sharp as linker length decreases. Thus, activation is more tolerant of sequence insertions than deletions. The residual levels of activation (~10% of wild-type) obtained after removal of 81 or more residues may result from binding of the RAM and ANK domains of two separate NICD molecules to CSL (Figure S1). This transcriptional activation profile is generally consistent with the effective concentration profile calculated from a WLC model proposed by Bertagna et. al.",PMC,pos,1,pos,3995,pos_PMC,0.997851,1

For the evaluation of the average glandular dose (AGD) in digital mammography (DM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) phantoms simulating standard model breasts are used. These phantoms consist of slabs of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or a combination of PMMA and polyethylene (PE). In the last decades the automatic exposure control (AEC) increased in complexity and became more sensitive to (local) differences in breast composition. The question is how well the AGD estimated using these simple dosimetry phantoms agrees with the average patient AGD. In this study the AGDs for both dosimetry phantoms and for patients have been evaluated for 5 different x-ray systems in DM and DBT modes. It was found that the ratios between patient and phantom AGD did not differ considerably using both dosimetry phantoms. These ratios averaged over all breast thicknesses were 1.14 and 1.15 for the PMMA and PMMA-PE dosimetry phantoms respectively in DM mode and 1.00 and 1.02 in the DBT mode. These ratios were deemed to be sufficiently close to unity to be suitable for dosimetry evaluation in quality control procedures. However care should be taken when comparing systems for DM and DBT since depending on the AEC operation, ratios for particular breast thicknesses may differ substantially (0.83-1.96).

METHODS This study included sixteen women diagnosed with breast cancer who had participated in a supervised 16-week PA intervention during adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. The qualitative approach included semi-structured individual and focus group interviews. Data were analyzed inductively with content analysis. RESULT The content analysis resulted in a description of experiencing health during chemotherapy treatment covered by five categories: Solidarity with others and being good to oneself; Experiencing functional improvement and social support; Empowerment and motivation to focus on health; Barriers to adherence to PA during illness and treatment; and Enabling health and independence. A core category was identified; PA a tool for maintenance and recovery of physical, mental and social health. The women reported that PA had a positive impact on both physical function and mental wellbeing. Participating in the PA intervention also increased their feeling of social support, which was reported to be important to motivate adherence to PA when the side effects became more severe. Symptom burden, time and lack of motivation were reported as barriers to continue PA during treatment.

26522158,"Mechanistic basis of Nek7 activation through Nek9 binding and induced dimerization. INTRODUCTION. Protein kinases are regulated through conformational changes in the catalytic domain brought about through phosphorylation, self-association or the binding of protein partners . Many protein kinases are activated through the phosphorylation of Ser, Thr or Tyr residues within the activation loop, which is stabilized to facilitate the binding of protein substrates . This phosphorylation event can be catalyzed by an upstream kinase, as happens in signaling cascades, or can be an auto-catalytic event, as happens in receptor tyrosine kinases upon dimerization. Many kinases can exist in an autoinhibited conformation that is incompatible with catalytic activity and are converted to an active conformation through a regulated mechanism. In one such mechanism, first identified in CDKs and Src-family kinases, the activation loop forms a short α-helix that stabilizes the αC-helix in an outward position relative to what is observed in active kinase structures . This outward position of the αC-helix disrupts a conserved salt-bridge formed between a glutamic acid on the αC-helix and a lysine on the β3-strand that positions the γ-phosphate of ATP for catalysis. Another hallmark of an inactive kinase evident in the CDK/Src-like autoinhibited conformation is a disrupted regulatory- or R-spine, which is made up of the side chains of four hydrophobic residues: the first residue of the β4 strand in the N-terminal lobe,a residue in the final turn of the αC-helix, the middle residue of the DFG motif and the first residue of the HRD motif . These elements of the CDK/Src-like autoinhibited conformation are conserved among many kinases whose regulatory mechanisms are otherwise quite distinct. This example is motivating researchers to look for other unifying themes in kinase regulation that will help to simplify and make sense of the extensive kinomes of humans and other organisms. Another common theme is protein kinase activation through self-association. This process is governed by a number of distinct structural mechanisms, which have recently been comprehensively reviewed . The eIF4α and IRE1/RNAseL protein kinase families provide an interesting example of activation through dimerization. Crystal structures of active, dimeric forms of these kinases reveal back-to-back dimers in which the active sites of each protomer face outwards. These dimers are formed by a symmetric association of kinase catalytic domains through an interface involving primarily their N-terminal lobes . Crystal structures of inactive forms of these kinases, where available, show disrupted R-spines and a shifted and/or unwound αC-helix . In these kinases dimerization promotes kinase activation by formation of a back-to-back interface that is coupled to the formation of an active conformation . The eleven members of the human NIMA-related Ser/Thr kinase (Nek) family have cell cycle-related signaling functions during mitosis, upon DNA damage and in cilia . Nek6, Nek7 and Nek9 contribute to mitotic spindle assembly during early mitosis with the microtubule motor protein Eg5 and heat shock protein Hsp72 as substrates of Nek6, and the centrosome-associated NEDD1 protein a substrate of Nek9 . Nek6 and Nek7 are also substrates of Nek9 that are activated through phosphorylation of key residues within their activation loops . Nek6 and Nek7 are closely related proteins that comprise a highly conserved catalytic domain preceded by a short divergent N-terminal extension (NTE) that determines their distinct substrate preference . Nek9 has an N-terminal kinase domain followed by an RCC1-like β-propeller domain and a C-terminal domain (CTD) comprising an unstructured region and a putative coiled-coil (CC). Nek6 and Nek7 interact with Nek9 through a region in the CTD that lies N-terminal to the CC and this interaction is blocked in interphase by cell cycle-dependent association of Nek9 with LC8 . The non-catalytic CTD of Nek9 provides a second and alternative mechanism of Nek6 and Nek7 activation through binding and allosteric relief of an autoinhibited state . Mechanistic insights into these kinases have been gained through the structures of Nek9 aa940-949 bound to LC8 and the structure of full-length Nek7 in an unphosphorylated, inactive form . The structure of Nek7 revealed an autoinhibited conformation characterized by the orientation of Tyr97 with the side chain pointing into the active site, stabilizing the αC-helix in an outwards position. Mutation of Nek7 Tyr97 to Ala, Leu or Phe results in a more active kinase, consistent with an autoinhibitory role of Tyr97. Nek9-CTD increases the activity of wild-type Nek7 to that of the Y97A mutant alone, suggesting this autoinhibitory mechanism is relieved through binding of Nek9-CTD. However, the mechanism through which the Nek9-CTD stimulates Nek7 catalytic activity is unknown. It also remains to be discovered exactly how Tyr97 mutations increase kinase activity, and how this relates to the mechanism of activation by Nek9-CTD. In this study, we address these questions through biochemical approaches interpreted in the light of the structure of Nek7Y97F bound to a fragment of Nek9-CTD. We find that the activation of Nek7 by Nek9-CTD unexpectedly resembles the mechanism that governs the activation of kinases from the eIF4α and IRE1 families. RESULTS. NEK9 810-828 IS THE MINIMAL NEK7 BINDING REGION. We set out to define the minimal region of the Nek9-CTD (aa 726-979) that was still capable of binding to Nek7. Fragments of Nek9-CTD truncated at the N- or C-terminus were generated as GST (glutathione S-transferase) tagged fusions. Nek9-Nek7 binding was visualised through immunoblotting with an anti-His6 antibody to detect bound Nek7-His6 (Supplementary Figure 1a). The smallest fragment that retained Nek7 binding comprised residues 810-828 that lies towards the middle of the unstructured region of the Nek9-CTD.

26527148,"MeshAndCollect: an automated multi-crystal data-collection workflow for synchrotron macromolecular crystallography beamlines. 1. INTRODUCTION. Merging partial X-ray diffraction data sets from many crystals to produce a complete data set can be traced back to the very beginnings of macromolecular crystallography (MX). Indeed, in order to cope with the radiation damage observed at room temperature, the crystal structure solution of myoglobin required the merging of partial data sets, each comprising a single precession photograph, from 22 crystals per heavy-atom derivative (Kendrew et al., 1960 ▸). However, with the introduction of cryogenic data-collection techniques (Hope, 1988 ▸) the effects of radiation damage could be limited dramatically. This generally allowed the collection of complete data sets from single crystals of biological macromolecules, even at beamlines at high-intensity third-generation synchrotron sources, and this soon became the norm. The emergence of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) saw multi-crystal data collection in MX revived and taken to its logical limits. Owing to the exceptionally bright nature of XFEL beams, experimenters adopted a ‘diffraction before destruction’ approach, dubbed serial femtosecond crystallo­graphy (SFX), streaming microcrystals through the X-ray beam and collecting still diffraction images where the crystal and X-ray laser pulse coincide (Chapman et al., 2011 ▸). Complete data sets are then compiled by combining data from many thousands of still diffraction images. While SFX is likely to prove a watershed in MX, chiefly because the crystal structures determined using the technique should be largely free of radiation damage (Neutze et al., 2000 ▸; Boutet et al., 2012 ▸), the technique is not without its disadvantages. In particular, the amount of protein required in SFX experiments is currently rather high even for structure solution based on molecular-replacement techniques (i.e. only native data sets are collected). Moreover, although software for SFX data analysis is rapidly developing (Sauter et al., 2013 ▸; White et al., 2012 ▸, 2013 ▸; Barty et al., 2014 ▸; Sawaya et al., 2014 ▸), as the diffraction images collected in such experiments contain predominantly partially recorded reflections measured from crystals of different sizes with laser pulses of different spectral content, estimation of the intensity (and its standard deviation) of any given reflection is problematical and data-processing methods will have to evolve significantly if the quality of SFX-collected data is to approach that currently available in ‘traditional’ MX experiments. Inspired by the success of SFX, experimenters at synchrotron MX beamlines have used similar paradigms (bright X-ray beams, fast read-out detectors, small crystals, single-exposure experiments) to develop synchrotron serial crystallography (SSX), showing that it is possible to compile useful data sets from hundreds or thousands of crystals introduced into the synchrotron beam either via jets (Nogly et al., 2015 ▸), liquid streams in glass capillaries (Stellato et al., 2014 ▸), free-standing high-viscosity micro-streams (Botha et al., 2015 ▸), sandwiched between two silicon nitride (Si3N4; Coquelle et al., 2015 ▸) or cyclic olefin copolymer (COC; Huang et al., 2015 ▸) wafers that are translated through the X-ray beam, or contained on a cryocooled sample holder (Gati et al., 2014 ▸). In the latter case the whole sample mount is continuously rastered through the X-ray beam, being rotated at the same time (de Sanctis et al., 2012 ▸), and diffraction images are recorded on the fly at set time intervals. As for crystals introduced into the X-ray beam in liquid streams or on silicon nitride wafers, the large majority of diffraction images collected contain no useful information. However, that fact that the sample is also rotated while being rastered means that where the crystal and the X-ray beam coincide some diffraction images could contain fully recorded reflections, thus rendering the processing and scaling of diffraction images using standard software packages relatively straightforward and improving the overall data quality. Moreover, for crystals larger than the X-ray beam, diffraction images can be grouped into those originating from the same crystal, thus also facilitating data processing and improving the resulting data quality (Gati et al., 2014 ▸). While for the same crystal volume and X-ray beam size the resolution obtainable in SSX experiments is likely to always be lower than that in SFX, SSX will become an important technique in MX. In particular, initial crystals of many systems are often small and SSX provides a means to study them without the need for the often time-consuming and cumbersome optimization of crystal size and/or quality. Indeed, when combined with the extremely bright X-rays beams that will be available at future low-emittance fourth-generation storage rings (see, for example, http://www.esrf.fr/Apache_files/Upgrade/ESRF-orange-book.pdf), such experiments may well become the norm. However, even when rastering samples contained on a cryocooled sample holder through the X-ray beam, SSX often suffers, as does SFX, from the fact that no attempt is made to synchronize the intersection of the X-ray beam and crystal during the experiment. Moreover, as the SFX ‘diffraction before destruction’ principle currently does not apply in SSX experiments on cryocooled samples, the amount of diffraction data collected from any given crystal is far from optimized. Recent developments based on either the optical (Huang et al., 2015 ▸) or diffraction-based (Soares et al., 2014 ▸) pre-interrogation of multi-crystal sample holders have ensured the synchronization of X-ray beam and crystals in SSX protocols and have enormously reduced the amount of sample required for a successful experiment. In a further step towards the optimal collection of diffraction data in SSX experiments from samples which can sustain the collection of many X-ray diffraction images before significant radiation damage occurs, we have developed",PMC,pos,1,pos,4048,pos_PMC,0.012288597,0
26543158,"Atomic structure of the apoptosome: mechanism of cytochrome c- and dATP-mediated activation of Apaf-1. Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is essential for the development and tissue homeostasis of all multicellular organisms (Horvitz 2003; Danial and Korsmeyer 2004). Apoptosis is executed by sequential activation of initiator and effector caspases (Shi 2002; Yan and Shi 2005). The major function of effector caspases, exemplified by the mammalian caspase-3, is to kill a cell by inflicting numerous cleavages on life-sustaining proteins. The primary role of an initiator caspase, on the other hand, is to cleave and hence activate specific effector caspases. In mammalian cells, the initiator caspase-9 is responsible for the activation of caspase-3. The autocatalytic activation of an initiator caspase depends critically on a specific, multiprotein complex. For caspase-9, this multiprotein complex is known as the apoptosome, which comprises seven copies of a heterodimer between apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) and cytochrome c (CytC) (Chai and Shi 2014). Because caspase-9 is essential for most known forms of intrinsic apoptosis, elucidation of its activation mechanism has been a central task toward mechanistic understanding of programmed cell death. The first major step toward this goal is to elucidate the mechanism of apoptosome assembly. In normal mammalian cells, Apaf-1 exists as an ADP-bound, autoinhibited monomer. In response to various forms of intrinsic cell death stimuli, CytC is released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm (Liu et al. 1996), where CytC binds the monomeric Apaf-1 and primes it for oligomerization (Li et al. 1997; Zou et al. 1997). The replacement of ADP by dATP or ATP results in marked conformational changes, allowing Apaf-1 to form an activated, heptameric apoptosome (Acehan et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2005; Bao et al. 2007). Only the activated apoptosome is capable of facilitating the autocatalytic activation of caspase-9 (Rodriguez and Lazebnik 1999; Saleh et al. 1999; Zou et al. 1999). How does CytC interact with Apaf-1? How can these interactions facilitate nucleotide exchange and oligomerization of Apaf-1? What is the mechanism of apoptosome-mediated activation of caspase-9? Despite rigorous investigations, these questions have remained largely enigmatic. The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the Apaf-1 apoptosome have been elucidated at a resolution range between 9.5 and 21 Å (Acehan et al. 2002; Yu et al. 2005; Yuan et al. 2010, 2011). These structures allowed placement of individual domains but failed to reveal specific interactions that govern the function of the apoptosome. X-ray structures of the monomeric, ADP-bound Apaf-1 provided an atomic view of the underpinnings of Apaf-1 autoinhibition (Riedl et al. 2005; Reubold et al. 2011). Together, these structural observations allowed the proposition of a speculative model that delineates the assembly of the apoptosome (Yuan et al. 2013). This model suffers from relatively low resolutions of prior EM structures and lack of supporting biochemical data. In this study, we report the three-dimensional (3D) structure of an intact Apaf-1 apoptosome at a near-atomic resolution of 3.8 Å, determined by single-particle, cryo-EM analysis. We present results of structure-guided biochemical analyses. These experimental data give rise to a mechanistic pathway of Apaf-1 activation and apoptosome assembly. RESULTS. OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE APAF-1 APOPTOSOME. The full-length human Apaf-1 was expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and biochemically purified to homogeneity. Assembly of an intact apoptosome was completed through incubation of the purified Apaf-1 protein with an excess amount of horse CytC and 1 mM dATP. The assembled apoptosome exhibited excellent solution behavior on gel filtration (Supplemental Fig. S1A) and markedly stimulated the proteolytic activity of caspase-9. We imaged the apoptosome sample under cryo-conditions on an FEI Titan Krios microscope operating at 300 kV and collected 912 micrographs (Supplemental Fig. S1B). We chose a total of 202,932 individual particles for reference-free two-dimensional (2D) classification (Supplemental Fig. S1C). After 3D classification, a subset of 134,919 particles was used for image construction, giving a final overall resolution of 3.8 Å on the basis of the gold Fourier shell correlation (FSC) standard (Supplemental Figs. S1D, S2). The overall architecture of the Apaf-1 apoptosome is similar to that reported previously (Yuan et al. 2013), comprising a central hub and seven spokes (Fig. 1A). The local resolution for the vast majority of the central hub ranges between 3.0 and 3.5 Å (Fig. 1A), which represents a qualitative improvement over previously reported resolutions and, for the first time, allows assignment of specific interactions involving amino acid side chains in the activated apoptosome (Supplemental Fig. S2). The local resolution at the spokes is considerably lower (Fig. 1A); local masking strategy markedly improved the resolution in this region to ∼5 Å, which allows unambiguous determination of the interface between Apaf-1 and CytC (Fig. 1B). Apaf-1 contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) at the N terminus, a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), a helical domain (HD1), a winged helix domain (WHD), a second helical domain (HD2), and 15 WD40 repeats at the C-terminal half. The central hub consists of seven copies each of the NBD, HD1, and WHD (Fig. 1C). The 15 WD40 repeats in each spoke constitute two β propellers named WD1 and WD2, which are connected to the central hub through the HD2 domain. The seven CARDs exhibit no EM density, likely reflecting their dynamic locations. CytC is sandwiched by the front faces of the two β propellers. The CytC-exposed side of the apoptosome is hereafter referred to as the top face (Fig. 1C), which is characterized by a ring of positively charged residues at the surface of the central hub (Supplemental Figs. S3, S4). In contrast, the bottom face of the apoptosome is enriched by negatively charg",PMC,pos,1,pos,4053,pos_PMC,0.9964619,1
26571211,"The leukodystrophy protein FAM126A (hyccin) regulates PtdIns(4)P synthesis at the plasma membrane. INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH. Genetic defects in myelin formation and maintenance cause leukodystrophies, a group of white matter diseases whose mechanistic underpinnings are poorly understood. Hypomyelination and Congenital Cataract (HCC), one of these disorders, is caused by mutations in FAM126A, a gene of unknown function. We show that FAM126A/Hyccin regulates the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), a determinant of plasma membrane identity. HCC patient fibroblasts exhibit reduced PI4P levels. FAM126A is an intrinsic component of the plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase complex that comprises PI4KIIIα and its adaptors TTC7 and EFR3. A FAM126A–TTC7 co-crystal structure reveals an all-α-helical heterodimer with a large protein-protein interface and a conserved surface that may mediate binding to PI4KIIIα. Absence of FAM126A, the predominant FAM126 isoform in oligodendrocytes, destabilizes the PI4KIIIα complex in mouse brain and patient fibroblasts. We propose that HCC pathogenesis involves defects in PI4P production in oligodendrocytes, whose specialized function requires massive plasma membrane expansion and thus generation of PI4P and downstream phosphoinositides. Our results point to a role of FAM126A in supporting myelination, an important process in development and also following acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis. MAIN TEXT. Phosphoinositides (PIPs) are low abundance anionic membrane phospholipids that play critical roles in many physiological processes. At the plasma membrane, a major PIP is PI4P, which has direct signaling roles and in addition serves as the precursor of two other plasma membrane-enriched PIPs with major signaling functions in this membrane, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3. In oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, these lipids regulate several steps in the biogenesis and maintenance of myelin, including the recruitment of myelin basic protein (MBP) to the plasma membrane by PI(4,5)P2 and the promotion of myelin growth by PI(3,4,5)P3. Phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) to generate PI4P at the plasma membrane is mediated by PI 4-kinase Type IIIα (PI4KIIIα, Stt4 in yeast). The properties, targeting mechanisms and regulation of this enzyme have only recently come into focus. Two factors required for its localization at the plasma membrane have been described and structurally characterized: EFR3 and TTC7 (Efr3 and Ypp1 in yeast). To identify additional regulators of PI4KIIIα, we used quantitative interaction proteomics. We immunoprecipitated either stably expressed TTC7B-GFP or GFP, followed by protease digestion and mass spectrometry analysis, to identify candidate TTC7B-binding proteins (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). These experiments identified the known TTC7B interaction partners PI4KIIIα, EFR3A, and EFR3B. Among the other hits, two of the most significantly enriched candidates were the paralogous FAM126A/hyccin and FAM126B, both of which were also identified in similar experiments using EFR3A-GFP or EFR3B-GFP as the bait (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Mutations in FAM126A that lead to loss of the FAM126A/hyccin protein cause a recessive leukoencephalopathy termed Hypomyelination and Congenital Cataract (HCC). Manifestations of this condition, which include progressive neurological impairment, mild to moderate cognitive defects, and peripheral neuropathy, stem from hypomyelination in the central and peripheral nervous systems. No molecular functions or activities have been ascribed to FAM126A, and the cellular and molecular mechanisms of HCC pathogenesis are unknown. Thus, the identification of FAM126A as a potential interaction partner of TTC7 and EFR3 led us to investigate its role in PI4KIIIα complex formation and function as a first step toward understanding whether defects in phosphoinositide metabolism may cause HCC pathology. We first explored and confirmed the interaction of FAM126A with TTC7, and more generally its association with the PI4KIIIα complex, in co-immunoprecipitation/immunoblot experiments (Fig. 1b). Two FAM126A immunoreactive species (58 and 47 kD) were enriched in TTC7B-GFP immunoprecipitates, corresponding to two predicted splice forms of FAM126A (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Accordingly, these two bands are absent in tissues from FAM126A knockout mice (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Given that the longer, 58 kD band represents the major form in mammalian brain (Supplementary Fig. 1d), we chose to focus on it in our subsequent studies. We then performed a reciprocal proteomics experiment using FAM126A-GFP-expressing cells to assess whether PI4KIIIα, TTC7, and EFR3 are the major interaction partners of FAM126A. Indeed, all of these proteins were the strongest hits in analogous quantitative proteomics experiments (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1) and were highly enriched in immunoblot analysis of FAM126A-GFP immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1b). Examination of the primary amino acid sequence of FAM126A revealed a highly conserved, structured N-terminal portion (FAM126A-N, residues 1–289) common to both splice forms and a poorly conserved C-terminal tail predicted to be disordered (FAM126A-C, residues 290–521) (Fig. 1c). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments of GFP-tagged full-length FAM126A, FAM126A-N, or FAM126A-C with differentially tagged PI4KIIIα, TTC7B, and EFR3B revealed an interaction of all of these components with full-length FAM126A and FAM126A-N (Fig. 1d). Note that the apparent more robust interaction of these proteins with FAM126A-N than with full-length FAM126A (Fig. 1d, lanes 6 and 7) reflects higher levels of FAM126A-N in the total lysate. Interestingly, overexpression of FAM126A-N led to a marked increase in levels of transfected TTC7B in total lysate (Fig. 1d, lane 3), suggesting a stabilizing interaction between these two proteins, as further confirmed by experiments described below. We next examined whether, as would be expected for a direct TTC7 interactor, FAM126A-N localizes to the plasma membrane when co-expr",PMC,pos,1,pos,4059,pos_PMC,0.99407744,1
26612684,"Janus-faced Sestrin2 controls ROS and mTOR signalling through two separate functional domains. Sestrins are a family of stress-inducible metabolic regulators1 that are conserved throughout the metazoan species. Cell-based studies showed that Sestrins have an antioxidant function that suppresses reactive oxygen species (ROS)2. In addition to its antioxidant activity, Sestrins activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and subsequently inhibit mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1)3. Genetic studies of Drosophila Sestrin (dSesn) revealed that dSesn also functions as a critical negative feedback regulator of dTORC1 (ref. 4). Depletion of dSesn downregulates AMPK and upregulates dTORC1, which together lead to the accelerated development of several age-related and obesity-induced pathologies, such as lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregate formation, cardiac arrhythmia and muscle degeneration4. These pathologies are very reminiscent of age-associated human diseases, which are promoted by obesity. Importantly, most of the observed pathologies were suppressed by administration of AMPK activators, mTORC1 inhibitors or antioxidants4, indicating that the mTORC1- and ROS-controlling functions of Sestrin are indeed important for its physiological functions. Similar age-associated metabolic defects were also observed in cSesn-mutated Caenorhabditis elegans5, suggesting that the physiological roles of Sestrin-family proteins are evolutionarily conserved. Indeed, Sestrins in mammals also play an important metabolism-regulating role. Recent studies indicate that mouse Sestrins are important for attenuating obesity-associated metabolic liver pathologies such as insulin resistance and steatohepatitis through oxidative stress suppression6 or AMPK activation, mTORC1 inhibition and subsequent mTORC2 potentiation789. Also in other tissues such as lungs1011, kidneys12, neurons131415, macrophages16, as well as embryonic fibroblasts17, mammalian Sestrins are important for proper regulation of ROS or mTORC1 signalling. Although it is clear that Sestrins are critical for ROS- and mTOR-associated metabolic homeostasis, we still do not have a clear biochemical understanding of how a single protein can perform such a diverse set of physiological roles, crucially important for metabolic homeostasis and aging prevention. This is mostly due to the complete lack of structural information about Sestrins. Here we report the crystal structure of human Sestrin2 (hSesn2) for the first time. The structure of hSesn2 displays an interesting internal symmetry with two homologous subdomains (Sesn-A and Sesn-C), which have a similar structure but distinct functions. Sesn-A functions as an alkylhydroperoxide reductase, while Sesn-C performs an mTORC1-inhibiting role. Through these two independent domains, Sestrin can single-handedly suppress both ROS and mTORC1, which are well-established promoters of aging and age-associated pathologies18. Therefore, our discovery provides an explanation for how a single protein can play such a versatile anti-aging role, especially considering that excessive ROS accumulation and chronic mTORC1 activation are well-known facilitators of aging and age-associated diseases. RESULTS. STRUCTURAL DETERMINATION OF FULL-LENGTH HSESN2 PROTEIN. To gain insights into the biochemical and structural properties of Sestrins, we determined the crystal structure of full-length hSesn2 at 3.5-Å resolution (Fig. 1a and Table 1). The electron density map of hSesn2 was calculated using the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method with selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted proteins. Despite its low-resolution diffraction, we were able to obtain a high-quality electron density map by taking advantage of non-crystallographic symmetry averaging (five copies of hSesn2 per asymmetric unit (ASU)) and the high solvent content (68%) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, the helix-dominant structure and appropriately located selenium positions (total 12 sites per monomer) allowed us to precisely place the sequence in the electron density map. The final refined model of hSesn2 shows an R/Rfree of 24.3/26.9. OVERALL STRUCTURE OF HSESN2 PROTEIN. The crystal structure revealed that hSesn2 belongs to the family of globin-like α-helix-fold proteins, consisting of 23 helices and no β-sheets (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a,c). The structure of full-length hSesn2 indicates that the protein contains three domains separated by two unstructured flexible linker regions (Fig. 1b). These three domains correspond well to the Sesn-A, Sesn-B and Sesn-C domains, which have been previously identified through a phylogenetic analysis19. Both Sesn-A and Sesn-C domains of hSesn2 form a globular shape, which is noticeably similar to each other (Figs 1a and 2a). Indeed, the Cα r.m.s. difference between Sesn-A and Sesn-C turned out to be only 1.95 Å (total 110 residues compared). Although Sesn-B was originally predicted to have a coiled coil motif (Supplementary Fig. 3), it forms a helix–loop–helix structure and lies on the surface of Sesn-C (Fig. 1a). hSesn2 appears to be a monomer, both in its crystal structure (Supplementary Fig. 1b) as well as in its analysis using size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle light scattering (Supplementary Fig. 4). STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY BETWEEN SESN-A AND OXIDOREDUCTASES. To infer the function of hSesn2 based on its three-dimensional structure, we searched for proteins structurally related to hSesn2 using a distance-matrix alignment programme (Dali server)20. The top ranked result revealed that both Sesn-A and Sesn-C possess a high degree of structural similarity with an uncharacterized protein YP_296737.1 (PDB ID: 2PRR) in Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5a). Interestingly, the Sesn-A and Sesn-C domains in the full-length hSesn2 protein overlap with the dimer structure of YP_296737.1 (Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting that the monomer of YP_296737.1 has been duplicated in hSesn2, and divergently evolved into two domai",PMC,pos,1,pos,4074,pos_PMC,0.99771273,1

26637280,"The large N-terminal region of the Brr2 RNA helicase guides productive spliceosome activation. Splicing entails the removal of noncoding sequences (introns) from primary transcripts and the concomitant ligation of neighboring coding regions (exons). It is mediated by a highly dynamic, multimegadalton RNA protein (RNP) molecular machine, the spliceosome, which consists of five small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs; U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 in the case of the major spliceosome) and numerous non-snRNPs (Wahl et al. 2009). For each round of splicing, a spliceosome is assembled de novo on a substrate by the stepwise recruitment of snRNPs and non-snRNPs. After assembly of a precatalytic complex, the spliceosome is catalytically activated and carries out the two consecutive steps of a splicing reaction before it is disassembled and its subunits are recycled. Each assembly, activation, catalysis, and disassembly step involves profound rearrangements of the spliceosomal RNP interaction networks, mediated predominantly by eight conserved superfamily 2 (SF2) NTPases/RNA helicases (Staley and Guthrie 1998). The most extensive rearrangements occur during spliceosome activation. In the precatalytic spliceosome, U4 and U6 snRNPs form a di-snRNP by base-pairing of their snRNAs and are associated with U5 snRNP via protein–protein interactions. During spliceosome activation, the U5 snRNP-specific Brr2 helicase unwinds the U4/U6 di-snRNAs (Noble and Guthrie 1996; Laggerbauer et al. 1998; Raghunathan and Guthrie 1998; Kim and Rossi 1999), leading to displacement of U4 and U4/U6-associated proteins and allowing U6 to engage in alternative interactions with the substrate and U2 snRNA as well as form an internal stem–loop that is an essential element in the spliceosome's active site. Structurally, Brr2 differs decisively from other spliceosomal helicases. It belongs to the Ski2-like subfamily of SF2 helicases and consists of an ∼500-residue N-terminal region (NTR) (Supplemental Fig. 1) of unknown fold and function followed by two structurally similar helicase cassettes. Each cassette contains dual RecA-like domains, a winged helix (WH) domain, and a Sec63 homology unit comprising a helical bundle (HB), a helix–loop–helix (HLH), and an immunoglobulin-like (IG) domain (Santos et al. 2012). During spliceosome activation, Brr2 engages a single-stranded region of U4 snRNA at a tunnel formed by its N-terminal RecA, WH, and HB domains and translocates on this RNA strand in an ATP-dependent manner to dissociate U4 from U6 (Hahn et al. 2012; Mozaffari-Jovin et al. 2012; Santos et al. 2012; Nguyen et al. 2015). Brr2 already encounters its U4/U6 substrate outside the spliceosome in a preformed U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP and remains associated, presumably in an inactive state (Hahn et al. 2012; Fourmann et al. 2013), with the spliceosome after catalytic activation. In a cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) structure of a yeast tri-snRNP, Brr2 was modeled in a conformation ready for U4/U6 dissociation, and, indeed, the particles disintegrated upon treatment with 1 mM ATP (Nguyen et al. 2015) as also previously seen with partially purified yeast tri-snRNP (Cheng and Abelson 1987; Raghunathan and Guthrie 1998). Therefore, molecular mechanisms must exist to prevent Brr2 from prematurely unwinding the U4/U6 duplex in the tri-snRNP and during initial stages of spliceosome assembly. Furthermore, in a recent cryo-EM structure of a spliceosome that underwent the first step of splicing, Brr2 could not be modeled due to its flexible anchoring (Yan et al. 2015). Again, it is unclear how Brr2 at this later stage of splicing is prevented from binding and remodeling nontarget RNAs/RNPs. Here, we investigated the idea that the Brr2 NTR might be crucial for regulating the enzyme's helicase activity at different stages of spliceosome assembly and splicing. Helicases often harbor accessory domains that can modulate their functions in diverse ways (Johnson and Jackson 2013), but only a few helicase structures are known that encompass the helicase core and an accessory domain. The Brr2 NTR is significantly longer than corresponding elements in most other helicases, is evolutionarily conserved, and is predicted to contain large intrinsically unstructured regions (Supplemental Fig. 1A). Using systematic structural and functional analyses, we elucidated the molecular organization of the NTR in the context of the helicase cassettes and showed that the NTR is required for efficient Brr2 binding to the U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP, for tri-snRNP homeostasis, and for splicing. We also demonstrate that the NTR autoinhibits Brr2 on multiple levels and by multiple mechanisms, fully in line with its structural organization. Our results uncover unique molecular mechanisms of how Brr2 is regulated during splicing. RESULTS. THE BRR2 NTR INTERLOCKS THE TWO HELICASE CASSETTES. To elucidate how the NTR is positioned with respect to the helicase cassettes of Brr2, we determined a crystal structure of full-length (FL) yeast Brr2 in complex with a Jab1/MPN-like (Jab1) domain of the Prp8 protein (lacking the last 15 C-terminal residues) (Fig. 1A–C; Table 1), a known regulator of Brr2 (Maeder et al. 2009; Mozaffari-Jovin et al. 2013, 2014; Nguyen et al. 2013). During refinement, we used all diffraction data collected up to 2.8 Å resolution (Table 1). The helicase region and Jab1 domain of the present complex resemble the corresponding elements in previously solved structures of truncated yeast (Nguyen et al. 2013) and human (Mozaffari-Jovin et al. 2013) Brr2–Jab1 complexes, with the Jab1 domain resting on top of the N-terminal Sec63 unit (Fig. 1C). Additionally, the present structure reveals that the NTR runs along one entire flank of the helicase region to an extent that is unprecedented in previously analyzed helicase structures (Fig. 1C). Based on the portions visible in the electron density (Supplemental Fig. 1B), the NTR can be divided into four sections (Fig. 1B,C). Residues 113–192 form a domain comprised of two roughly perpendicular helical hairpins that is wedged into a gap betwe",PMC,pos,1,pos,4081,pos_PMC,0.9971827,1
26655473,"Pre-Anchoring of Pin1 to Unphosphorylated c-Myc in a Fuzzy Complex Regulates c-Myc Activity. SUMMARY. Hierarchic phosphorylation and concomitant Pin1-mediated proline isomerization of the oncoprotein c-Myc controls its cellular stability and activity. However, the molecular basis for Pin1 recognition and catalysis of c-Myc and other multisite, disordered substrates in cell regulation and disease is unclear. By nuclear magnetic resonance, surface plasmon resonance, and molecular modeling, we show that Pin1 subdomains jointly pre-anchor unphosphorylated c-Myc1–88 in the Pin1 interdomain cleft in a disordered, or “fuzzy”, complex at the herein named Myc Box 0 (MB0) conserved region N-terminal to the highly conserved Myc Box I (MBI). Ser62 phosphorylation in MBI intensifies previously transient MBI-Pin1 interactions in c-Myc1–88 binding, and increasingly engages Pin1PPIase and its catalytic region with maintained MB0 interactions. In cellular assays, MB0 mutated c-Myc shows decreased Pin1 interaction, increased protein half-life, but lowered rates of Myc-driven transcription and cell proliferation. We propose that dynamic Pin1 recognition of MB0 contributes to the regulation of c-Myc activity in cells. INTRODUCTION. Among the most fundamental processes in cell biology is the regulation of the cell cycle and, thereby, cell growth. A key player in this process is the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 that has been shown to function as a molecular timer by acting as a switch of various cell-signaling processes (Liou et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2007). One of the targets of Pin1 is the proto-oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc, which is a universal regulator of cell growth, apoptosis, and proliferation in both normal and tumor cells (Lin et al., 2012; Meyer and Penn, 2008; Nie et al., 2012). While the pro-proliferative properties of c-Myc are activated by phosphorylation of Ser62, its cellular stability and degradation are controlled by subsequent phosphorylation at Thr58, both sites being located in the conserved Myc Box I (MBI) region of its N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (TAD) (Hann, 2006). The time window of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at these two sites is affected by Pin1-mediated cis-trans isomerization of the Ser62-Pro motif, thereby regulating specific interactions of c-Myc with modifying kinases, predominantly acting on trans substrates (Brown et al., 1999; Lu et al., 2002a) and phosphatases, which control the pathway of c-Myc activation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation (Figure 1A) (Farrell and Sears, 2014; Sears, 2004), and which have been shown to act on cis substrates (Werner-Allen et al., 2011). Pin1 also facilitates the dynamic binding of c-Myc to target gene promoters, enhancing association with transcriptional co-activators and transcriptional activation of target genes, thus potentiating c-Myc’s oncogenic activity (Farrell et al., 2013). The importance of regulatory coupling c-Myc activation with its subsequent degradation in maintaining normal cell growth is evidenced by cancer-associated mutations at or near Thr58 and Ser62 that result in maintaining c-Myc in its activated, Ser62-phosphory-lated state (Bahram et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2011), and many regulators of c-Myc that bind to this region are themselves either oncogenes or tumor suppressors (Tu et al., 2015). Although Pin1 promotes c-Myc degradation in normal cells, this activity is uncoupled in cancer cells where both proteins have oncogenic activities and are overexpressed, and Pin1 functions only as a c-Myc co-activator (Farrell et al., 2013). Potential uncoupling mechanisms involve reduced Axin1 function, which scaffolds c-Myc degradation (Arnold et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2012b) and Pin1’s downregulation of Fbw7, an E3 ligase controlling degradation of a number of oncoproteins including c-Myc (Min et al., 2012). Pin1 comprises two independently folded subdomains: Pin1WW (residues 6–39) and Pin1PPIase (residues 50–163), connected by a flexible linker (Bayer et al., 2003; Jacobs et al., 2003; Ranganathan et al., 1997). The catalytic proline isomerization activity toward pSer/pThr-Pro motifs entirely resides in Pin1PPIase (Lu et al., 1999; Ranganathan et al., 1997). The Pin1PPIase alone binds weakly to native, phosphorylated peptide targets (KD > 390 μM) (De et al., 2012; Verdecia et al., 2000), with significant affinities (Kd range 0.5–90 μM) observed only for peptides selected from library screens (Duncan et al., 2011; Namanja et al., 2011; Verdecia et al., 2000) or designed inhibitors (Namanja et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012a). Pin1WW binds pSer/ pThr-Pro-containing peptides with variable affinities (Kd > 7 μM) (Lu et al., 1999; Verdecia et al., 2000), preferably in the extended, trans conformation (De et al., 2012; Namanja et al., 2011; Verdecia et al., 2000; Wintjens et al., 2001). In intact Pin1, the two domains create an interdomain cleft, distant from the Pin1PPIase active site, where phosphorylated target peptides (Kd 5–80 μM) (Verdecia et al., 2000) as well as buffer components such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) bind in well-defined conformations (reviewed in Matena et al., 2013). Pin1WW binding at phosphorylated pSer/pThr-Pro sites has been proposed to increase the local effective concentration of substrate and activity on neighboring phosphorylated sites (Jacobs et al., 2003; Lu et al., 1999), to facilitate substrate transfer (De et al., 2012; Lu et al., 1999; Wintjens et al., 2001), and/or to sequester trans conformations away from the active site, thereby providing directionality to the cis-trans conversion (De et al., 2012; Namanja et al., 2011; Wintjens et al., 2001). Still, the functional reason for binding of targeted peptides to an interdomain cleft distant from the Pin1 active site remains unresolved. Recent studies suggest that collaborative and possibly allosteric mechanisms jointly involve both Pin1 domains in target binding (reviewed in Peng, 2015). Binding of shorter peptide substrates and small molecules to Pin1 has been shown to affect interdomain mobility and",PMC,pos,1,pos,4087,pos_PMC,0.9976859,1
26682650,"Human Holliday junction resolvase GEN1 uses a chromodomain for efficient DNA recognition and cleavage. INTRODUCTION. Homologous recombination (HR) is a fundamental pathway ensuring genome integrity and genetic variability (Heyer, 2015). In mitotic cells, double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be repaired by HR using the sister chromatid as a template to restore the information in the complementary double strand. In meiosis, the repair of programmed DSBs by HR and the formation of crossovers are crucial to provide physical linkages between homologs and to segregate homologous chromosomes. Furthermore, HR during meiosis creates sequence diversity in the offspring through the exchange between homologs (Petronczki et al., 2003; Sarbajna and West, 2014). HR proceeds by pathways that may lead to the formation of DNA four-way junctions or Holliday junctions (HJs) that physically link two homologous DNA duplexes (Heyer, 2015; Holliday, 1964; Schwacha and Kleckner, 1995; Szostak et al., 1983). Faithful removal of HJs is critical to avoid chromosome aberrations (Wechsler et al., 2011) and cells have evolved sophisticated measures to disentangle joint molecules. One basic mechanism is resolution mediated by HJ resolvases that introduce precise symmetrical nicks into the DNA at the branch point. Nicked DNA strands are then rejoined by endogenous ligases leading to fully restored or recombined DNA strands. This mechanism is well studied for bacterial and bacteriophage resolvases such as Escherichia coli RuvC, T7 endonuclease I, T4 endonuclease VII (Benson and West, 1994; Lilley and White, 2001). These resolvases operate as dimers and show a large degree of conformational flexibility in substrate recognition and in aligning both active sites for coordinated cleavage. Interestingly, T4 endonuclease VII and RuvC reach into and widen the DNA junction point whereas T7 endonuclease I binds DNA by embracing HJs at the branch point (Biertümpfel et al., 2007; Górecka et al., 2013; Hadden et al., 2007). In eukaryotes, HR is more complex and tightly regulated. In somatic cells, HJ dissolution by a combined action of a helicase and a topoisomerase (BLM-TOPIIIα-RMI1-RMI2 complex in humans) is generally the favored pathway, possibly to restore the original (non-crossover) DNA arrangement (Cejka et al., 2010, 2012; Ira et al., 2003; Putnam et al., 2009; Wu and Hickson, 2003). In contrast, HJ resolution generates crossover and non-crossover arrangements depending on cleavage direction. Several endonucleases such as GEN1, MUS81-EME1, and SLX1-SLX4 have been implicated as HJ resolvases in eukaryotes (Andersen et al., 2011; Castor et al., 2013; Fekairi et al., 2009; Garner et al., 2013; Ip et al., 2008; Muñoz et al., 2009; Svendsen and Harper, 2010; Svendsen et al., 2009; Wyatt et al., 2013). Interestingly, these resolvases are not structurally related and have different domain architectures, giving rise to variable DNA recognition and regulation mechanisms. The interplay between resolution and dissolution mechanisms is not fully understood yet, however, cell cycle regulation of resolvases seems to play an important role (Blanco et al., 2014; Chan and West, 2014; Eissler et al., 2014; Matos et al., 2011). GEN1 belongs to the Rad2/XPG family of structure-selective nucleases that are conserved from yeast to humans (Ip et al., 2008; Lieber, 1997; Yang, 2011). The Rad2/XPG family has four members with different substrate preferences that function in DNA maintenance (Nishino et al., 2006; Tsutakawa et al., 2014). They share a conserved N-terminal domain (XPG-N), an internal domain (XPG-I) and a 5’->3’ exonuclease C-terminal domain containing a conserved helix-hairpin-helix motif. C-terminal to the nuclease core is a regulatory region that is diverse in sequence and predicted to be largely unstructured. Although the catalytic cores are well conserved in the superfamily, substrate recognition is highly diverse: XPG/Rad2/ERCC5 recognizes bubble/loop structures during nucleotide-excision repair (NER), FEN1 cleaves flap substrates during Okazaki fragment processing in DNA replication, EXO1 is a 5'->3' exonuclease that is involved in HR and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and GEN1 recognizes Holliday junctions (Grasby et al., 2012; Ip et al., 2008; Nishino et al., 2006; Tomlinson et al., 2010; Tsutakawa et al., 2014). A common feature of the superfamily is their inherent ability to recognize flexible or bendable regions in the normally rather stiff DNA double helix. Interestingly, GEN1 shows versatile substrate recognition accommodating 5’ flaps, gaps, replication fork intermediates and Holliday junctions (Ip et al., 2008; Ishikawa et al., 2004; Kanai et al., 2007). According to the current model, however, the primary function of GEN1 is HJ resolution (Garner et al., 2013; Sarbajna and West, 2014; West et al., 2015) and it is suggested to be a last resort for the removal of joint molecules before cytokinesis (Matos et al., 2011). To date, structural information is available for all members of the family but GEN1 (Miętus et al., 2014; Orans et al., 2011; Tsutakawa et al., 2011). A unified feature of these structures is the presence of two DNA-binding interfaces separated by a hydrophobic wedge. This wedge is composed of two protruding helices that induce a sharp bend into flexible DNA substrates. Rad2/XPG family members also share a helix-two-turn-helix (H2TH) motif that binds and stabilizes the uncleaved DNA strand downstream of the catalytic center. However, the comparison of DNA recognition features within the Rad2/XPG family has been hampered because of the lack of structural information on GEN1. To understand the molecular basis of GEN1's substrate recognition, we determined the crystal structure of human GEN1 in complex with HJ DNA. In combination with mutational and functional analysis using in vitro DNA cleavage assays and in vivo survival assays with mutant yeast strains, we highlight GEN1’s sophisticated DNA recognition mechanism. We found that GEN1 does not only have the classical DNA recognition features of Rad2/XPG nucleases, but a",PMC,pos,1,pos,4094,pos_PMC,0.98951083,1
26707201,"Defining the Intrinsically Disordered C-Terminal Domain of SSB Reveals DNA-Mediated Compaction. The bacterial single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein SSB is a strictly conserved and essential protein involved in diverse functions of DNA metabolism, including replication and repair. SSB comprises a well-characterized tetrameric core of N-terminal oligonucleotide binding OB folds that bind ssDNA and four intrinsically disordered C-terminal domains of unknown structure that interact with partner proteins. The generally accepted, albeit speculative, mechanistic model in the field postulates that binding of ssDNA to the OB core induces the flexible, undefined C-terminal arms to expand outwards encouraging functional interactions with partner proteins. In this structural study, we show that the opposite is true. Combined small-angle scattering with X-rays and neutrons coupled to coarse-grained modeling reveal that the intrinsically disordered C-terminal arms are relatively collapsed around the tetrameric OB core and collapse further upon ssDNA binding. This implies a mechanism of action, in which the disordered C-terminal domain collapse traps the ssDNA and pulls functional partners onto the ssDNA.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4098,pos_MEDLINE,0.99791294,1

26748655,"1H, 15N, 13C resonance assignment of human GAP-43. BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT. GAP-43 is a 25 kDa neuronal intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) highly abundant in the neuronal growth cone during development and regeneration. The exact molecular function(s) of GAP-43 remains unclear but it appears to be involved in growth cone guidance and actin cytoskeleton organization (Frey et al. 2000). Therefore, GAP-43 seems to play an important role in neurotransmitter vesicle fusion and recycling, long-term potentiation, spatial memory formation and learning (Denny 2006). GAP-43 experiences S-palmitoylation on positions Cys3 and Cys4 (Liu et al. 1993). Once acylated, it is bound to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane in the growth cone of axons where it sequesters phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into lipid rafts via electrostatic interactions involving polybasic stretches (Laux et al. 2000). GAP-43 appears to be regulated by calcium- and PIP2-signaling cascades as it can bind calmodulin (CaM) and is the substrate of protein kinase C (PKC) (Apel et al. 1990; Maekawa et al. 1994). GAP-43 interacts with both apo and holo-CaM via its IQ domain (from His32 to Leu51), which adopts a helical conformation upon binding (Kumar et al. 2013). Phosphorylation by PKC occurs within the IQ domains at Ser41. Phosphorylation prevents the association with CaM and influences membrane binding (Maekawa et al. 1994; Tejero-Diez et al. 2000). Additionally, the phosphorylated form of GAP-43 seems to stabilize actin filaments via a direct interaction (He et al. 1997). Interestingly, GAP-43 is functionally related to the neuronal IDP BASP1, which is also under investigation in our group. In order to gain insight into the intriguing membrane and ligand binding properties of GAP-43 and how post-translational modifications affect its structural dynamics and therefore its binding properties, we first achieved the near complete chemical shift assignment of human GAP-43. METHODS AND RESULTS. PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. The coding region for human GAP-43 was obtained by assembly PCR (Stemmer et al. 1995), this procedure allows to directly optimize the coding sequence for the chosen expression system and to avoid undesired restriction sites inside the coding sequence. 32 oligonucleotides, covering the entire coding sequence of GAP-43, were designed using the online software DNAworks (Hoover and Lubkowski 2002). The PCR gene assembly was realized according to a published protocol (Stemmer et al. 1995). The final gene amplification was performed from 1 μl of the gene assembly mixture by introducing 5′ NdeI and 3′ NotI restriction sites. Subsequently, the fragment was inserted in-frame into the NdeI and NotI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET-41b, yielding pET-41b-hGAP-43, encoding human GAP-43 fused to a C-terminal His6-tag. The two cysteines on position 3 and 4 were replaced by glycines by site-directed mutagenesis. 15N/13C labeled GAP-43 was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain T7 express (New England BioLab) in minimal medium containing 15N-labeled ammonium chloride and 13C-glucose as sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. GAP-43 expression was induced at an A600nm of 0.6 by addition of 0.8 mM IPTG. The cells were collected after 16 h of expression at 30 °C by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in 30 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM NaPi pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl) per liter of the original bacterial culture. Bacteria were lysed by passing through a French press, and the cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant containing the soluble protein fraction was loaded onto a Ni2+ loaded HiTrap 5 ml affinity column (GE Healthcare), washed with 2 column volumes of high salt buffer (20 mM NaPi pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) and eluted with high imidazole buffer (20 mM NaPi pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 M imidazole) using a linear gradient of 15 column volumes. The GAP-43 containing fractions were collected and the buffer was exchanged by dialysis in the measurement buffer, 20 mM NaPi pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl and subsequently concentrated to 0.5 mM in an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device 10 K NMWL (Amicon). NMR EXPERIMENTS. The backbone 1H, 13C and 15N resonances were assigned using a set of high dimensionality experiments exploiting sparse random sampling of indirectly detected time domains, in order to increase resolution. A 3D HNCO and 3D CACON experiments were used as a base spectra for sparse multidimensional Fourier transform (SMFT) processing of higher dimensionality experiments (Kazimierczuk et al. 2009). Backbone assignment was achieved using 4D HN(CA)NH (Zawadzka-Kazimierczuk et al. 2010) 5D HN(CA)CONH (Kazimierczuk et al. 2010), (HACA)CON(CA)CONH (Zawadzka-Kazimierczuk et al. 2012b), (H)NCO(NCA)CONH (Zawadzka-Kazimierczuk et al. 2012b) experiments.

All those5D experiments were acquired at 298 K on an Agilent Direct Drive 700 MHz spectrometer using the standard 5 mm 1H–13C–15N triple-resonance probe head. Additionally, to obtain proline residues assignment two directly 13C detected experiments: 3D CACON and 5D (HACA)CONCACON (Bermel et al. 2013) were performed using Agilent Direct Drive 2 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with cryogenically cooled 5 mm 1H–13C–15N triple-resonance probe head.

26865045,"Crystal structure and functional implications of the tandem-type universal stress protein UspE from Escherichia coli. BACKGROUND. The universal stress proteins (USP) superfamily is a group of conserved proteins that play an important role in E. coli. USPs’ expression levels become elevated in response to a bewildering variety of stress conditions, such as heat shock, nutrient starvation, the presence of oxidants, DNA-damaging agents (including exposure to mitomycin C, cadmium, and hydrogen peroxide), as well as others, that may arrest cell growth. Proteins in the UspA family constitute a natural biological defense mechanism [1, 2]. Despite considerable research on the behavior of UspA family members, the biological and biochemical roles of these proteins remain largely uncharacterized. Very few details were available to help decipher their roles in the aforementioned cellular processes [1]. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of E. coli’s UspA proteins is important for establishing effective therapeutic strategies. In particular, establishing the three-dimensional structural model of the UspE protein can provide hints to explore the function(s) of the UspA family. E. coli has six small UspA superfamily genes: uspA, -C -D, -E, -F, and -G. To date, these proteins have been extensively investigated. Previous studies have shown that UspA family members show immaculate similarity. They encode either a small USP protein (approximately 14 to 15 kDa) that consists of two USP domains in tandem or a larger version (approximately 30 kDa) that consists of two peptides attached as a single functional protein [3, 4]. UspA, UspC, and UspD belong to class I; UspF and UspG belong to class II; two Usp domains of UspE belong to class II and IV based on the sequence and structural analysis [3, 5, 6]. Previous works have found that while Usp family members have partially overlapping functions, the functions of class I, II, and IV Usps are distinct [7]. UspA proteins differ in their responses to protect cells from oxidative stress and DNA damage agents; UspA, UspC, UspD, and UspE are induced by exposure to mitomycin C, cadmium, and hydrogen peroxide. However, class II proteins, UspG and UspF, were associated with iron scavenging in the cell [4]. As mentioned before, UspE is a tandem-type USP. When UspE proteins are split apart and treated separately, the UspE2 domain is more closely related to UspF and UspG. This is clearly visible in both the clustering analysis and the reconstructed cladogram. In contrast, UspE1 groups are more closely related to class I UspA proteins (UspACD) [1]. This paper includes structural and functional studies on UspE from E. coli. Specifically, it presents the three-dimensional X-ray crystal structure of the recombinantly produced UspE from E. coli at 3.2 Å resolution. Additionally, through the use of structural biochemical analyses, the UspE mechanisms were determined. In terms of its overall structure, UspE was found to be similar to the tandem-type Usp protein PMl1202 from Proteus mirabilis, which has a hydrophobic cavity that binds an unidentified ligand. It was also observed that UspE has an ATP binding motif (Gly269-Thr-Val-Gly272-X9-Gly282-Asn) in its C-terminal domain. The ATPase activity was then measured to determine if UspE had ATPase activity and to characterize UspE activity. Because previous research found that UspE is critical for Cd2+ defense, we characterized the role of UspE as part of the Cd2+ binding process by ITC and structural analysis and found that UspE has two Cd2+ binding sites in its tandem USP domain. These observations suggest that UspE performs several distinct functions, such as ATP hydrolysis and cadmium defense. Although the molecular function of this protein remains unknown, our three-dimensional structures of UspE offer valuable clues to understand its potential biochemical mechanisms. METHODS. STRUCTURE DETERMINATION, REFINEMENT AND PROTEIN DATA BANK ACCESSION NUMBER OF USPE. We have previously reported the crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of E. coli UspE [8]. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The structure of the E. coli UspE protein was determined by molecular replacement (MR) using the program CCP4 package [9]. We used the coordinates of the structures of P. mirabilis PMl1202 (78.5 % sequence identity; PDB code: 3OLQ) as a reference. To build our protein model, we first removed model bias by rounds of simulated annealing performed with the program PHENIX [10], followed by calculating the differences using Fourier maps. Then, the UspE model was rebuilt in the graphic program COOT [11]. The model was finally refined using the same programs by iterative rounds of energy minimization, B-factor, and anisotropic refinements. Then, the composite omit and differences were calculated by Fourier maps. UspE coordinates and structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank [12] under accession code: 5CB0 (www.rcsb.org/pdb). ISOTHERMAL TITRATION CALORIMETRY. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were performed on a Microcal iTC 200 (GE Healthcare) VP-ITC microcalorimeter at 298 K. The protein was dialyzed against 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0) and 150 mM NaCl. The titration CdCl2 solution was prepared with 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0) and 150 mM NaCl by adding 2 mM CdCl2. Both the protein and the titrant CdCl2 solutions were thoroughly degassed in a ThermoVac apparatus (Microcal). The titration reaction was performed by sequential injections of 40 μl CdCl2 solution into the sample cell. The duration of the injection was 120 s. The syringe was rotated at 600 rev min-1. Triplet measurements were collected in each case. KINASE-GLO® LUMINESCENT KINASE ASSAY. The in vitro ATPase activity of UspE was measured by quantifying the amount of ATP remaining in the solution following a kinase reaction using a Kinase-Glo® Luminescent Kinase Assay Kit (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). The assay was performed in a 96-well plate in a kinase reaction volume of 50 μl containing 10 mM MgCl2,5 μM ATP,10 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) and 150 m",PMC,pos,1,pos,4126,pos_PMC,0.99664956,1
26870912,"Serum BDNF levels in unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with bipolar disorder. INTRODUCTION. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable condition.1 -3 Although numerous investigations have tried to identify specific genes associated with vulnerability to this disease, this task has been hampered, among other factors, by the phenotypic heterogeneity of BD.4 A possible solution to this problem would be the identification of endophenotypes, which are genetically mediated biomarkers involved in the pathophysiology of BD and also detected in first-degree relatives.5,6. It has been hypothesized that decreased neurotrophin expression, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), plays a role in the pathophysiology of BD and contributes to neuroplastic changes observed in the brains of patients with mood disorders.7 -9 BDNF is a protein produced by neurons and platelets involved in several brain functions, including neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, axonal and dendritic growth, and brain connectivity.10 BD patients have low serum BDNF levels compared with healthy controls (HC)11 -13 and these levels correlate negatively with the severity of depressive and manic symptoms.11,12 Additionally, BDNF seems to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms in BD14 and there is evidence in favor of BDNF as a potential clinical biomarker for this disorder.15 However, few studies have investigated whether serum BDNF levels could indicate high genetic risk for BD.16. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the differences in serum BDNF levels among BD patients, their unaffected relatives, and HC. The investigation of this biochemical alteration in individuals at high genetic risk for BD may potentially identify an endophenotype of this highly disabling disease. METHODS. PATIENTS. Patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Institute of Psychiatry of the School of Medicine, Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil, or were selected from the community through advertising in the media. The sample consisted of 25 BD patients, 23 unaffected relatives, and 27 HC. All of the patients signed a written informed consent for their participation in the study. Patients were diagnosed with BD type I, according to DSM-IV criteria, were older than 18 years, and were in remission. They had to have at least one first-degree relative older than 18 years willing to participate in the study. Remission was defined as failure to meet the criteria for any mood episode in the last 2 months and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores below 8 on the day of participation.17 Patients were allowed to continue taking their current medication. The unaffected relatives group consisted of proband’s first-degree relatives older than 18 years and without a lifetime axis I disorder. Inclusion criteria for HC were age older than 18 years, no lifetime DSM-IV axis I disorder, and no lifetime DSM-IV axis I disorder among first-degree relatives. Subjects were excluded if they were pregnant, if they had a severe and/or decompensated medical condition with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hypothyroidism, and if they had neurological disorders, such as epilepsy or stroke. The presence of active alcohol/drug use disorders in the last 12 months was an additional exclusion criteria for BD patients. All the procedures were carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine at Universidade de São Paulo. PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENTS. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV diagnosis (SCID), versions for both patients and non-patients, was used to confirm the diagnosis of BD type I in patients and to rule out the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in unaffected relatives and HC.18 The 17-item HDRS19 and the YMRS20 were used to evaluate the presence of depressive and manic symptoms, respectively. Board-certified psychiatrists (FGN, JAA) with extensive research experience in mood disorders applied the SCID, HDRS, and YMRS to all subjects. SAMPLING AND BDNF ANALYSIS. Blood for measurement of BDNF levels was collected at the same time (between 10 a.m. and noon). Serum samples were separated and frozen at 80 °C until analysis. Serum BDNF levels were determined by sandwich-ELISA using BDNF-specific monoclonal antibodies, as described previously21 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, United States). Briefly, microtiter (96-well flat-bottom) plates were coated overnight at room temperature with monoclonal anti-BDNF antibody (4 μg/mL in phosphate buffer solution (PBS)) (Laborclin, Paraná, Brazil). Thereafter, plates were washed three times (PBS, pH 7.4, with 0.05% Tween 20 – Nuclear, São Paulo, Brazil) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with PBS containing 5% nonfat milk powder. After being washed again, plates were coated for 2 h at room temperature with the samples diluted 1:200 (PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin – Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States), and the standard curve ranged from 7.8 to 500 pg/mL of BDNF. Plates were washed again, 0.2 μg/mL of a biotinylated anti-BDNF antibody in PBS was added, and they were incubated again for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, incubation was carried out with streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (diluted 1:200 in sample diluents) for 20 min at room temperature. Plates were then washed and incubated with the substrate for 20 min at room temperature. Finally, a stop solution (H2SO4, 1 M – Nuclear, São Paulo, Brazil) was added and the BDNF levels were determined by absorbance at 450 nm with correction at 540 nm. The standard curve indicated a direct relationship between optical density and BDNF concentration. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Chi-square tests were used for cross-tabulated qualitative data to compare clinical and demographic variables. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for ordinal and interval scale data to compare BD patients, unaffected relatives, and HC.

26933034,"Family-wide Characterization of Histone Binding Abilities of Human CW Domain-containing Proteins. Covalent modifications of histone N-terminal tails play a critical role in regulating chromatin structure and controlling gene expression. These modifications are controlled by histone-modifying enzymes and read out by histone-binding proteins. Numerous proteins have been identified as histone modification readers. Here we report the family-wide characterization of histone binding abilities of human CW domain-containing proteins. We demonstrate that the CW domains in ZCWPW2 and MORC3/4 selectively recognize histone H3 trimethylated at Lys-4, similar to ZCWPW1 reported previously, while the MORC1/2 and LSD2 lack histone H3 Lys-4 binding ability. Our crystal structures of the CW domains of ZCWPW2 and MORC3 in complex with the histone H3 trimethylated at Lys-4 peptide reveal the molecular basis of this interaction. In each complex, two tryptophan residues in the CW domain form the ""floor"" and ""right wall,"" respectively, of the methyllysine recognition cage. Our mutation results based on ZCWPW2 reveal that the right wall tryptophan residue is essential for binding, and the floor tryptophan residue enhances binding affinity. Our structural and mutational analysis highlights the conserved roles of the cage residues of CW domain across the histone methyllysine binders but also suggests why some CW domains lack histone binding ability.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4149,pos_MEDLINE,0.9973218,1

A series of 3-dimensional (3-D) structural mesoporous silica materials, SBA-16, MCM-48 and KIT-6, was synthesized and supported with different ZnO loadings (10, 20, 30, and 40 wt%) by the incipient wetness method to evaluate the performances on H2S removal at room temperature. These materials were characterized by N2 adsorption, XRD, and TEM to investigate their textural properties. All the ZnO-loaded adsorbents exhibited the H2S removal capacity of bellow 0.1 ppmv. With the best ZnO loading percentage of 30 wt% on MCM-48 and KIT-6, 20 wt% on SBA-16 according to the results of breakthrough test, further increasing ZnO loading caused the decrease of the adsorption capacity due to the agglomeration of ZnO. Besides, the H2S adsorption capacities of the supports materials varied in the order of KIT-6>MCM-48>SBA-16, which was influenced primarily by their pore volume and pore size. With the largest pores in these 3-D arrangement materials, KIT-6 showed the best performance of supported material for ZnO, due to its retained superior physical properties as well as large pore diameter to allow faster gas-solid interaction and huge pore volume to disperse ZnO on the surface of it.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,4157,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0022738955,0
26973877,"Structures of ribosome-bound initiation factor 2 reveal the mechanism of subunit association. INTRODUCTION. Initiation of translation is an intensively regulated multistep reaction (1). In bacteria, binding of initiator fMet-tRNAiMet to the AUG start codon at the P-site of the 30S subunit defines the correct reading frame of the mRNA. Formation of the 30S initiation complex (30S-IC) is aided by three universal initiation factors (IFs): IF1, IF2, and IF3. The translational guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) IF2, a key player of the late steps of the initiation reaction (2), facilitates the association of the 30S-IC with the large 50S ribosomal subunit to form the 70S-IC. IF2 is composed of five domains, including a less conserved N-terminal domain followed by the C-terminal domains I to IV (3). Domain I confers GTPase activity and, together with domains II and III, the ability to bind directly to the 30S subunit (4), whereas the C-terminal domain IV promotes interaction with the initiator fMet-tRNAiMet (5, 6). A recent x-ray study of IF2 revealed the structure of all the domains except domain IV (4, 7), and low-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps depict the overall location of IF2 between the ribosomal subunits (8–11). However, high-resolution structural information on ribosome-bound IF2 and its interactions with ribosome and initiator transfer RNA (tRNA) remain elusive, precluding a mechanistic understanding of the functional role of IF2. RESULTS. To solve the structure of ribosome-bound IF2, the factor was stalled on programmed 70S ribosomes by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanylylimidodiphosphate (GDPNP) in the presence of fMet-tRNAiMet. Although previous cryo-EM analysis depicted only one major state (4, 8), multiparticle refinement (12) of our cryo-EM data resulted in two cryo-EM maps for subpopulations of the 70S–fMet-tRNAiMet–IF2–GDPNP complex (Fig. 1 and fig. S1). These differ significantly in the rotational state of the ribosomal subunits, the position of the L1 stalk, and the binding mode of the fMet-tRNAiMet. The smaller subpopulation (70S-IC I; 14,874 particle images, 4.6-Å resolution) is in a fully rotated ribosome state, with the 30S rotated by 8.4° and the 30S head mildly swiveled by 2.4° compared to the classical 70S ribosome conformation (13) (Fig. 1C). The larger subpopulation (70S-IC II; 54,585 particle images, 3.7-Å resolution) is in a semirotated state and undergoes only a moderate intersubunit rotation of 3.7° (Fig. 1F). The near-atomic resolution of major parts of the reconstruction of the 70S-IC II (Fig. 1, G to I, and fig. S2) facilitated atomic model building, aided by existing crystal structures. Although the overall structure is in general agreement with previous cryo-EM analysis (4, 8), there are several pronounced differences. For example, the C-terminal domain IV of IF2 is rotated by ~180°, compared to previous cryo-EM models (4, 8) in our present structure (fig. S3). Ribosomal intersubunit rotation affects the binding states of initiator fMet-tRNAiMet (Fig. 2). Although in both substates the AUG start codon and fMet-tRNAiMet anticodon stem loop stay bound in the P-site of the 30S subunit (Fig. 2A), the tRNAs are differentially positioned relative to the 50S subunit (Fig. 2B). The codon-anticodon duplex within the 70S-IC I is similar in position to a canonical P/E tRNA (13), and the elbow of the fMet-tRNAiMet also interacts with the L1 stalk (fig. S4). At first glance, this position of the fMet-tRNAiMet elbow is surprising because the 50S E-site is specific for deacylated tRNA (14, 15). However, the tRNA adopts a unique conformation and binding mode because the acceptor stem is bent toward the P-site and the 3′-CCA–fMet end is displaced by more than 20 Å to interact with IF2 domain IV (Fig. 2B). We term this novel chimeric tRNA state of the 70S-IC I complex the P/ei state (30S P-site, 50S E-site, and IF2). In the 70S-IC II complex, the initator tRNA is located closer to the P-site (Fig. 2B), and the tRNA elbow interacts with the central protuberance (CP) of the 50S subunit. Accordingly, we term this the P/pi state. Overall, the position of the P/pi-tRNA is similar but not identical to the P/I-tRNA previously delineated at lower resolution (8). Because the interaction with the L1 stalk, which has been previously reported for the P/I-tRNA, is only observed for the P/ei-tRNA but not for the P/pi-tRNA, we may have disentangled a previously inseparable P/I-tRNA into P/pi and P/ei-states (fig. S4). Relative to the 30S, the fMet-tRNAiMet appears to follow the 30S head swivel, resulting in a small tilting toward the E-site for the P/ei-tRNA compared to the P/pi-tRNA (Fig. 2A). A similar observation has been made by Julián and colleagues (11) based on a lower-resolution cryo-EM map of a 30S-IC containing fMet-tRNAiMet and all three initiation factors. The striking resemblance between the 30S-IC and the equivalent parts of the fully rotated 70S-IC I substate suggests that this state is close to the state immediately after subunit joining. The semirotated 70S-IC II substate in turn resembles an intermediate state on the way to the nonrotated classical elongation state. This assignment is in overall agreement with single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer data reporting an early 70S-IC in the rotated state that is converted into an elongation-competent 70S complex by back rotation of the 30S subunit (16, 17). The fact that we have not detected a nonrotated ribosome state can be explained by the fact that the full back rotation requires GTP hydrolysis by IF2. Going from the 70S-IC I to the 70S-IC II, both the body of the fMet-tRNAiMet and the core domains of IF2 essentially follow the partial back rotation of the 30S subunit (Fig. 3A). In contrast, domain IV of IF2 is hardly moving, keeping its location in the neighborhood of the 50S peptidyl transferase center and interactions with ribosomal protein uL16 and 23S rRNA helices H89 and H71. Domain IV of IF2 in turn retains the 3′-A-fMet of the initiator tRNA, which is cradled by the two",PMC,pos,1,pos,4159,pos_PMC,0.996852,1
26994519,"Pre-operative labs: Wasted dollars or predictors of post-operative cardiac and septic events in orthopaedic trauma patients?. PURPOSE As US healthcare expenditures continue to rise, there is significant pressure to reduce the cost of inpatient medical services. Studies have estimated that over 70% of routine labs may not yield clinical benefits while adding over $300 in costs per day for every inpatient. Although orthopaedic trauma patients tend to have longer inpatient stays and hip fractures have been associated with significant morbidity, there is a dearth of data examining pre-operative labs in predicting post-operative adverse events in these populations. The purpose of this study was to assess whether pre-operative labs significantly predict post-operative cardiac and septic complications in orthopaedic trauma and hip fracture patients. METHODS Between 2006 and 2013, 56,336 (15.6%) orthopaedic trauma patients were identified and 27,441 patients (7.6%) were diagnosed with hip fractures. Pre-operative labs included sodium, BUN, creatinine, albumin, bilirubin, SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, white count, hematocrit, platelet count, prothrombin time, INR, and partial thromboplastin time. For each of these labs, patients were deemed to have normal or abnormal values. Patients were noted to have developed cardiac or septic complications if they sustained (1) myocardial infarction (MI), (2) cardiac arrest, or (3) septic shock within 30 days after surgery. Separate regressions incorporating over 40 patient characteristics including age, gender, pre-operative comorbidities, and labs were performed for orthopaedic trauma patients in order to determine whether pre-operative labs predicted adverse cardiac or septic outcomes. RESULTS 749 (1.3%) orthopaedic trauma patients developed cardiac complications and 311 (0.6%) developed septic shock. Multivariate regression demonstrated that abnormal pre-operative platelet values were significantly predictive of post-operative cardiac arrest (OR: 11.107, p=0.036), and abnormal bilirubin levels were predictive (OR: 8.487, p=0.008) of the development of septic shock in trauma patients. In the hip fracture cohort, abnormal partial thromboplastin time was significantly associated with post-operative myocardial infarction (OR: 15.083, p=0.046), and abnormal bilirubin (OR: 58.674, p=0.002) significantly predicted the onset of septic shock. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to demonstrate the utility of pre-operative labs in predicting perioperative cardiac and septic adverse events in orthopaedic trauma and hip fracture patients. Particular attention should be paid to haematologic/coagulation labs (platelets, PTT) and bilirubin values.

27026704,"Substrate Recognition and Activity Regulation of the Escherichia coli mRNA Endonuclease MazF. Escherichia coli MazF (EcMazF) is the archetype of a large family of ribonucleases involved in bacterial stress response. The crystal structure of EcMazF in complex with a 7-nucleotide substrate mimic explains the relaxed substrate specificity of the E. coli enzyme relative to its Bacillus subtilis counterpart and provides a framework for rationalizing specificity in this enzyme family. In contrast to a conserved mode of substrate recognition and a conserved active site, regulation of enzymatic activity by the antitoxin EcMazE diverges from its B. subtilis homolog. Central in this regulation is an EcMazE-induced double conformational change as follows: a rearrangement of a crucial active site loop and a relative rotation of the two monomers in the EcMazF dimer. Both are induced by the C-terminal residues Asp-78-Trp-82 of EcMazE, which are also responsible for strong negative cooperativity in EcMazE-EcMazF binding. This situation shows unexpected parallels to the regulation of the F-plasmid CcdB activity by CcdA and further supports a common ancestor despite the different activities of the MazF and CcdB toxins. In addition, we pinpoint the origin of the lack of activity of the E24A point mutant of EcMazF in its inability to support the substrate binding-competent conformation of EcMazF.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4173,pos_MEDLINE,0.99729556,1
27036297,"Naringenin prevents TGF-β1 secretion from breast cancer and suppresses pulmonary metastasis by inhibiting PKC activation. BACKGROUND. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in female cancer patients, accounting for 23 % of all new cancer cases worldwide. Metastasis from the primary breast tumor is the leading cause of mortality among these patients [1, 2]. An association between elevated cellular and plasma transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 levels and increased breast cancer metastasis has been reported previously [3–7]. Secreted TGF-β1 promotes metastasis via transforming T cells to regulatory T cells (Tregs), which facilitates the escape of cancer cells from host immune responses [8], and/or by inducing cancer cells to undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) [9]. The proliferation of cancer cells increases TGF-β1 secretion, leading to a more metastatic phenotype [10]. Clinical studies have reported a link between the presence of a tumor and an increase of CD4+CD25+ cells in the blood [11–13]. Tregs constitutively express Foxp3, which is the master regulator that mediates the immunosuppressive function of Tregs [14–16]. Small molecule TGF-β1 inhibitors are a feasible approach for breast cancer metastasis prevention and therapy. TGF-β1 blocking antibodies, short hairpin RNA of TGF-β1, and inhibitors of TGF-β1 receptors have been shown to prevent tumor development and metastasis [17–19]. However, complete inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling by receptor inhibitors or antibodies showed serious adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal and skin-related events [20], thrombocytopenia, and keratoacanthomas/squamous cell carcinoma [21]. TGF-β proteins are synthesized as inactive precursor proteins with an amino-terminal prodomain followed by the carboxyl-terminal mature ligand. Precursor proteins dimerize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are cleaved by serine proteases. Following processing, they are transported through the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the cell surface for release and to the lysosome for degradation [22–24]. Inhibiting the proteins that target TGF-β for secretion may be a new strategy to block signal transduction of the TGF-β pathway. Naringenin, the predominant flavanone in grapefruit, is reported to possess a broad range of pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, carbohydrate metabolism promotion, and modulating the immune system [25]. Our previous study showed that naringenin reduced TGF-β1 levels in fibrotic microenvironments and prevented fibrosis-induced lung metastasis [26], and that naringenin inhibited TGF-β1-induced migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells [27]. In the context of fibrosis-induced lung metastasis, TGF-β1 could be derived from various cell types, including cancer cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, epithelial cells, and immune cells. To investigate the role of breast tumor-derived TGF-β1 for metastasis, and whether naringenin can suppress metastasis by blocking TGF-β1 secretion from breast tumor cells, we constructed a Tgf-β1 overexpressing breast tumor cell line (4T1/TGF-β1) and examined its metastatic potential in both in vitro and in vivo models. Our data demonstrated that naringenin effectively reduced TGF-β1 release and suppressed tumor cell migration and pulmonary metastasis. Unexpectedly, naringenin prevented TGF-β1 secretion by a post-translational mechanism, which differs from TGF-β neutralizing antibodies and TGF-β receptor antagonists. The results of this study may provide a novel therapeutic approach for intervention of TGF-β signaling pathway-related diseases and disorders. More importantly, our study reveals that targeting the intracellular trafficking machinery of cytokines may be an attractive strategy for developing new anti-cytokine therapies. METHODS. CELL LINES AND MATERIALS. The murine breast cancer cell line 4T1 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). 4T1 cells, the vector control (4T1/RFP), and TGF-β1-overexpressing 4T1-Luc2 cells (4T1/TGF-β1) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. 1D11 antibody was from eBioscience Tech (San Diego, CA, USA). Naringenin was purchased from Shanxi Huike Botanical Development Co. (Xi'an, China). GENERATION OF 4T1/TGF-Β1 TRANSFORMANTS. Human growth hormone signal sequence was synthesized and fused with the full-length mouse Tgf-β1 gene using PCR. The hybrid gene of human growth hormone signal sequence and mouse Tgf-β1 was then ligated into pSin-EF2-Oct4-Pur plasmid (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA) to replace Oct4 with SpeI and EcoRI cloning sites at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively. RFP from the pmRFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) was then cloned into the pSin-EF2-TGFβ1-Pur plasmid to replace puromycin. The generated Tgf-β1 overexpression vectors were then enveloped in 293T cells. The medium containing the packaged virus was used to infect 4T1-Luc2 breast cancer cells (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) to generate 4T1/TGF-β1 transformants. The control transformants, 4T1/RFP cells, were generated using the vector without Tgf-β1 gene, following the same procedures. 4T1/RFP and 4T1/TGF-β1 transformants were then sorted by flow cytometry with excitation/emission of 578/603 nm.

27050267,"Crystal structure of a tankyrase 1-telomere repeat factor 1 complex. Telomere repeat factor 1 (TRF1) is a subunit of shelterin (also known as the telosome) and plays a critical role in inhibiting telomere elongation by telomerase. Tankyrase 1 (TNKS1) is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase that regulates the activity of TRF1 through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation). PARylation of TRF1 by TNKS1 leads to the release of TRF1 from telomeres and allows telomerase to access telomeres. The interaction between TRF1 and TNKS1 is thus important for telomere stability and the mitotic cell cycle. Here, the crystal structure of a complex between the N-terminal acidic domain of TRF1 (residues 1-55) and a fragment of TNKS1 covering the second and third ankyrin-repeat clusters (ARC2-3) is presented at 2.2 Å resolution.

27056844,"Phase separation of signaling molecules promotes T cell receptor signal transduction. Many cell surface receptors and downstream signaling molecules coalesce into micron- or submicron-sized clusters upon initiation of signaling (1, 2). However, the effect of this clustering on signal transduction is poorly understood. T cell receptor (TCR) signaling is a well-studied example of this general phenomenon (3). TCR signaling proceeds through a series of biochemical reactions that can be viewed as connected modules. In the upstream module, the TCR is phosphorylated by Lck, a membrane-bound protein kinase of the Src family. TCR phosphorylation is opposed by a transmembrane phosphatase, CD45 (3). The phosphorylated cytoplasmic domains of the TCR complex recruit and activate the cytosolic tyrosine kinase ZAP70 (4). In the intermediate module, ZAP70 phosphorylates the transmembrane protein LAT (Linker for activation of T cells) on multiple tyrosine residues. These phosphotyrosines are binding sites for adapter proteins Grb2 and Gads, which further interact with Sos1 (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small guanosine triphosphatase Ras) or SLP-76 (another adaptor in TCR signaling). Components of the LAT complex activate several downstream modules that mediate calcium mobilization, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and actin polymerization (5, 6). LAT and its binding partners coalesce into micron- or submicron-sized clusters at the plasma membrane upon TCR activation (7–10). Elimination of these microclusters by deletion of key components (for example, LAT or Grb2) impairs downstream signaling and transcriptional responses (5, 11). However, effects due to loss of clusters have not been distinguished from those due to loss of component molecules. Nor do we understand the changes in biochemistry and consequent signaling that emerge specifically when signaling molecules are organized from an unclustered to a clustered state (12). To explore the mechanism of formation and functional consequences of T cell microclusters, we reconstituted a TCR signaling pathway from purified components. To substitute for the plasma membrane, we used supported bilayers composed of a defined, simple lipid composition. We initially reconstituted the intermediate module of the TCR signaling cascade, composed of phosphorylated LAT (pLAT), Grb2, and Sos1. Multivalent interactions between these proteins (Fig. 1A) are thought to drive the formation of signaling microclusters on the T cell membrane (8, 13), although direct experimental evidence for the sufficiency of this mechanism has been lacking. We prepared fluorescently labeled pLAT, containing the four C-terminal phospho-tyrosine residues that are sufficient for TCR signaling (14); this pLAT also contains an N-terminal His8 tag that allowed its attachment to Ni2+-containing supported lipid bilayers (15). pLAT was uniformly distributed (Fig. 1B) and freely diffused on the lipid bilayer (movie S1). Upon addition of Grb2 and Sos1, submicron-sized clusters formed within 1 minute and gradually grew in size. Cluster formation required tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT (fig. S1D). Furthermore, dephosphorylation of pLAT by high concentrations of the soluble protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B, 2 µM) caused the clusters to disassemble (Fig. 1B, movie S2). pLAT, Grb2, and Sos1 all colocalized within clusters, and clusters did not form if either Grb2 or Sos1 was omitted (fig. S1E, F). pLAT also clustered with Gads and SLP-76, two other components of LAT clusters in cells (6, 7), but less efficiently than with Grb2 and Sos1 (fig. S2A, B). Clustering efficiency, however, increased dramatically with the addition of Nck (fig. S2C), an adaptor protein known to link SLP-76 to actin regulators (16). pLAT, Grb2, and Sos1 clusters exhibited dynamic liquid-like properties. The rounded edges of clusters fluctuated (extending and retracting) on a time scale of seconds and clusters sometimes fused with one another (movie S2). pLAT molecules exchanged into and out of clusters, as revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (Fig. 1C). Single pLAT molecules diffused rapidly outside of clusters but slowly within them (fig. S3A–C). We also observed capture and release of single molecules by clusters (movie S3). These results show that pLAT microclusters are liquid-like, phase-separated structures (17, 18) on membranes. Both SH3 domains of Grb2 were required for cluster formation, indicating a role of protein cross-bridging by this adaptor protein (Fig. 1D and fig. S4A). Clustering initially increased with increasing pLAT density but then decreased at higher pLAT densities on the membrane (fig. S4B), consistent with a theoretical multivalent interaction model (19). The valency of phospho-tyrosines on LAT also affected clustering efficiency. Three of the four distal phospho-tyrosines in LAT are recognized by the SH2 domain of Grb2 (20). Clustering in vitro progressively decreased by mutating one, two, or all three tyrosines and was enhanced by doubling the number of tyrosines (Fig. 1E and fig. S5). Together, our data indicate that LAT cluster formation is driven by dynamically rearranging, multivalent protein-protein interactions. We compared the properties of LAT clusters in cells with those of reconstituted clusters in vitro and tested their functional importance. As in vitro, LAT microclusters in T cells sometimes fused with one another (fig. S3D). FRAP revealed that molecules exchange into and out of clusters in cells faster than in vitro (t1/2 of 12 sec versus 76 sec), possibly due to different cluster size (see Supplementary Text) or membrane fluidity. To assess valency dependence in cells, we expressed LAT tyrosine mutants with zero, one, two, three, or six Grb2 binding sites in a LAT-deficient Jurkat T cell line. A minimum of two Grb2 binding sites was required for robust cluster formation and the degree of clustering increased with increasing number of phospho-tyrosine sites (Fig. 2B). The degree of clustering correlated with",PMC,pos,1,pos,4180,pos_PMC,0.80597603,1
27082063,"Conformational characterization of the intrinsically disordered protein Chibby: Interplay between structural elements in target recognition. The protein Chibby (Cby) is an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway, where it inhibits the binding between the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin and the Tcf/Lef transcription factors. The 126 residue Cby is partially disordered; its N-terminal half is unstructured while its C-terminal half comprises a coiled-coil domain. Previous structural analyses of Cby using NMR spectroscopy suffered from severe line broadening for residues within the protein's C-terminal half, hindering detailed characterization of the coiled-coil domain. Here, we use hydrogen/deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to examine Cby's C-terminal half. Results reveal that Cby is divided into three structural elements: a disordered N-terminal half, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal unstructured extension consisting of the last ∼ 25 residues (which we term C-terminal extension). A series of truncation constructs were designed to assess the roles of individual structural elements in protein stability and Cby binding to TC-1, a positive regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. CD and NMR data show that Cby maintains coiled-coil structure upon deletion of either disordered region. NMR and ITC binding experiments between Cby and TC-1 illustrate that the interaction is retained upon deletion of either Cby's N-terminal half or its C-terminal extension. Intriguingly, Cby's C-terminal half alone binds to TC-1 with significantly greater affinity compared to full-length Cby, implying that target binding of the coiled-coil domain is affected by the flanking disordered regions.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4190,pos_MEDLINE,0.997981,1
27108344,"Apoptosis and autophagy induced by pyropheophorbide-α methyl ester-mediated photodynamic therapy in human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells. BACKGROUND. Osteosarcoma was the most common malignant bone tumor and the age of osteosarcoma patients mainly ranged from 10 to 25 years old. It resulted in a 5-year survival rate of approximately 65–75 % [1]. It was well known that surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have greatly improved the outcomes of osteosarcoma, but recurrence, metastasis and drug resistance resulted in a poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. Moreover, marginal or extended resection for the treatment of osteosarcoma can impair limb function, and radio- and chemotherapy often lead to severe toxicity and side effects. Therefore, novel treatment with strong anti-tumor effects and few side effects was urgently required to improve the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was a minimally invasive technology for treating tumors. In PDT, a photosensitizer was systemically administered, and then visible light at a certain wavelength was applied to locally irradiate the tumor [2]. Upon excitation, the photosensitizer reacted with oxygen via the photochemical reaction and photobiological reaction, generating abundant amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can induce cell death [2]. Therefore, surgery combined with PDT may have some important potential in improving the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. Previous studies revealed that PDT can promote the destruction of tumor cells via the following mechanisms: direct cytotoxicity to the tumor cells, induction of anti-tumor immune response, and damage to tumor vessels [3]. Furthermore, it was reported that apoptosis was regarded as one of the main mechanisms mediating PDT-induced tumor cell death [4]. The main morphologic changes in apoptosis (also called type I programmed cell death) included the concentration and fragmentation of chromosomes, cell shrinkage, invagination of cell membrane and generation of apoptosis bodies [5]. In addition, PDT can induce mitochondrial permeability transition and activate the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway [6]. It can also lead to the aggregation of unfolded proteins, leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and further inducing endoplasmic reticulum-associated apoptosis [7]. Moreover, a caspase-independent pathway was found to mediate the PDT-induced apoptosis [8]. Autophagy, also referred to as type II programmed cell death, is the processes of organelle or protein degradation by the cells themselves [9, 10]. Autophagy and apoptosis were often simultaneously triggered by the same stimulus, but their complicated relationships were controversial. For example, autophagy was found to have the ability to inhibit, delay, or promote the occurrence of apoptosis [11–13]. It was known that PDT showed the potential in inducing autophagy and apoptosis [14], but the detailed mechanisms and the relationships between autophagy and apoptosis remained unclear. Photosensitizers were regarded as the key factor in PDT. Pyropheophorbide-α methyl ester (MPPa), a derivative of chlorophyll, was known as a second generation photosensitizer. It had many advantages including clear chemical structure, stability, rapid absorption and metabolism and strong photoelectric sensitivity [15]. In this study, we explored the influence of MPPa-PDT on apoptosis and autophagy of human osteosarcoma (MG-63) cells, and investigated the related molecular mechanisms as well as the relationships between apoptosis and autophagy induced by MPPa-PDT. MATERIALS AND METHODS. REAGENTS AND INSTRUMENTS. MG-63 cells was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, USA). MPPa, Monodansylcadaverine (MDC), Hoechst 33258, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA), SP600125, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), Chloroquine (CQ) N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St-Louis, MO, USA).

Annexin V–propidium iodide (PI) double-staining test kit was purchased from Keygen Biotech (Nanjing, China). PDT equipment was purchased from Chongqing Jingyu Laser Technology Co. Ltd.

DRUG TREATMENT AND MPPA-PDT. In the MPPa-PDT group, MG-63 cells in the logarithmic phase were cultured in the dark with different MPPa concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.5 μmol/L) for 20 h and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The culture medium was replaced, and the cells were exposed to light using an LED with a wavelength of 630 nm in the continuous output mode and a laser power density of 40 mW/cm2. The light energy densities were varied by adjusting the exposure time including 0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 s; the corresponding density values were 0, 1.2, 2.4, 4.8, and 9.6 J/cm2. Following the light exposure, the cells were cultured in complete culture medium at 37 °C in 5 % CO2 in the dark. In the MPPa-alone group and LED-alone group, cells were subjected to only MPPa treatment or LED light exposure in the same manner compared to the MPPa-PDT group. Before MPPa-PDT treatment, some of the cells were pretreated with 3-MA (5 mmol/L), CQ (10 μmol/L), SP600125 (10 μmol/L), or NAC (10 mmol/L). DETECTION OF CELL VIABILITY BY CCK-8 ASSAY.

27133468,"Data-driven analysis of simultaneous EEG/fMRI reveals neurophysiological phenotypes of impulse control. Response inhibition is the ability to suppress inadequate but prepotent or ongoing response tendencies. A fronto-striatal network is involved in these processes. Between-subject differences in the intra-individual variability have been suggested to constitute a key to pathological processes underlying impulse control disorders. Single-trial EEG/fMRI analysis allows to increase sensitivity for inter-individual differences by incorporating intra-individual variability. Thirty-eight healthy subjects performed a visual Go/Nogo task during simultaneous EEG/fMRI. Of 38 healthy subjects, 21 subjects reliably showed Nogo-related ICs (Nogo-IC-positive) while 17 subjects (Nogo-IC-negative) did not. Comparing both groups revealed differences on various levels: On trait level, Nogo-IC-negative subjects scored higher on questionnaires regarding attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder; on a behavioral level, they displayed slower response times (RT) and higher intra-individual RT variability while both groups did not differ in their inhibitory performance. On the neurophysiological level, Nogo-IC-negative subjects showed a hyperactivation of left inferior frontal cortex/insula and left putamen as well as significantly reduced P3 amplitudes. Thus, a data-driven approach for IC classification and the resulting presence or absence of early Nogo-specific ICs as criterion for group selection revealed group differences at behavioral and neurophysiological levels. This may indicate electrophysiological phenotypes characterized by inter-individual variations of neural and behavioral correlates of impulse control. We demonstrated that the inter-individual difference in an electrophysiological correlate of response inhibition is correlated with distinct, potentially compensatory neural activity. This may suggest the existence of electrophysiologically dissociable phenotypes of behavioral and neural motor response inhibition with the Nogo-IC-positive phenotype possibly providing protection against impulsivity-related dysfunction.

27141962,"A small protein inhibits proliferating cell nuclear antigen by breaking the DNA clamp. INTRODUCTION. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an essential protein in archaea and eukarya (1–4). PCNA plays essential roles in nucleic acid metabolic processes including replication, repair, recombination and cell cycle progression (5,6). PCNA is trimeric and forms a ring that encircles duplex DNA. In the trimer, the polypeptides are positioned in a head-to-tail arrangement with the interface between subunits forming an antiparallel β-sheet that is also supported by ionic and hydrophobic interactions [reviewed in: (2)]. Each monomer is composed of two structurally similar domains linked by a long loop (inter-domain connector loop, IDCL) on the outside of each monomer of the trimeric structure (7). When encircling DNA, PCNA interacts with a large number of enzymes and regulates their biochemical properties (6). PCNA primarily interacts with proteins via a PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) motif (8). The canonical PIP motif is a weak consensus sequence of eight amino acids QXXhXXaa where ‘h’ is a moderately hydrophobic amino acid and ‘a’ is an aromatic residue (9). The PIP-containing proteins bind to the PCNA trimer in a small hydrophobic cavity near the IDCL [reviewed in: (10)]. Genes encoding for PCNA have been identified in all archaeal genomes [(11) and references therein]. While the genomes of most euryarchaeota contain a single gene encoding PCNA, the genome of Thermococcus kodakarensis contains two genes encoding PCNA homologs (TK0535 and TK0582, encoding PCNA1 and PCNA2, respectively) (12–14). Although the two proteins are similar in structure and biochemical properties (12–14), only PCNA1 is essential for T. kodakarensis viability (13,14). We will refer to PCNA1 as PCNA in the remainder of this manuscript. Using a genetic approach, a small protein that interacts with T. kodakarensis PCNA was previously identified (15). The protein, encoded by TK0808, was shown to inhibit PCNA-dependent activities (16). The gene encoding for the protein is found only in Thermococcales genomes and therefore it was designated TIP (Thermococcales inhibitor of PCNA). TIP is a 64 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 7.6 kDa and a pI of 9.9 (Figure 1A). The three-dimensional (3D) structure of TIP bound to PCNA was determined using X-ray crystallography. TIP alone is partially disordered (Supplementary Figure S1), but upon binding to PCNA becomes structured. Several residues of TIP form a short helix that binds in a similar manner to other PIP-containing proteins, while the residues that follow form a helix that binds to a hydrophobic region on PCNA that is created by displacement of the IDCL. This movement of the IDCL also alters the relationship of the two domains of the PCNA monomer such that the usual trimeric ring structure cannot form. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) confirms the disruption of the PCNA trimer in the PCNA:TIP complex. The implications of these results for a mechanism of PCNA inhibition in archaea are discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PROTEIN AND PEPTIDES. PCNA protein was expressed and purified as previously described (12). Full length TIP and TIP peptide (residues 28–64) and flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1) peptide (residues 330–340) were chemically synthesized as follows. The peptides were synthesized on a Tribute peptide synthesizer (Protein Technologies, Inc.) at the 50 μmol scale. Coupling was performed for all amino acids for 20 min, using 1:1:2 0.05 M amino acid:0.05 M HCTU (2-(6-Chloro-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylaminium hexafluorophosphate):0.4 M N-methylmorpholine in DMF (dimethylformamide), with a 10-fold excess of amino acid and activator relative to the Fmoc-Leu-Wang Resin (Novabiochem). Deprotection was performed with 20% piperidine in DMF. Protecting groups for Fmoc synthesis included OtBu (Asp, Glu, Ser, Thr and Tyr), Trt (His and Asn), Boc (Lys) and Pbf (Arg). All amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem. Following synthesis, the peptides were cleaved from the resin with 88:5:5:2 TFA:water:EDT:TIPS (trifluoroacetic acid:water:1,2-ethanedithiol:triisopropylsilane) for two hours at room temperature. Cold ether was then added to the vial and the peptides were precipitated by centrifugation (10 min, 5500 g); the cold ether precipitation was repeated two times. The samples were dried with nitrogen overnight. The crude peptide was then dissolved in 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA in water and purified on a Shimadzu HPLC equipped with an XSelect CSH C18 Prep column (5 μm, 10 × 250 mm). Samples were run on a gradient from 0 to 100% B and 100 to 0% A, where Buffer A is 0.1% TFA, 5% acetonitrile in water and Buffer B was 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA in water for 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. UV detection was set for 214 and 280 nm. Mass analysis of the peak eluting at 53–56% Buffer B was performed on a Bruker microflex MALDI-TOF. Appropriate fractions were combined and lyophilized on a Labconco Freezone benchtop lyophilizer. CRYSTALLIZATION. Crystals of PCNA with TIP were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion. The ratio of PCNA to TIP was ∼1:1.2. The stock solution of PCNA was 3.2 mg/ml (0.11 mM as monomer) in 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.0), 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 10% glycerol. The stock solution of TIP was 8 mg/ml (1.05 mM) in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 500 mM NaCl. The well solution was 1.2 M ammonium sulfate, 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.0) and 10% glycerol. The drops were formed by adding equal volumes of protein and well solution. For the PCNA:FEN-1 structure, a peptide consisting of 11-residues of the T. kodakarensis FEN-1 protein [residues 330–340 (Figure 1A), encoded by the TK1281 gene] was used. Crystals of PCNA with FEN-1 peptide were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion. The ratio of PCNA to peptide was approximately 1:5. The PCNA protein was in the same solution as above. The peptide concentration was 2 mM in water. The well solution was 2.8 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM citric acid buffer (pH 5.3) and 10%",PMC,pos,1,pos,4207,pos_PMC,0.9908213,1
27174498,"A combined computational and structural model of the full-length human prolactin receptor. The prolactin receptor (PRLR) and its primary ligand prolactin (PRL) constitute a complex receptor system, linked to more than 300 biological functions ranging from reproduction and cell differentiation to immune responses12. It is best known for its role in mammary gland development and lactation3 as well as the pathology hyperprolactinemia4, but has also been linked to reproductive disorders5 as well as breast67 and prostate8 tumorigenesis, and has therefore attracted significant pharmaceutical interest. The PRLR belongs to the hematopoietic cytokine receptor superfamily, which consists of more than 40 members9. It is considered an archetype of the homodimeric group 1 of the family9, constituting the simplest cytokine receptors and including, for example, the growth hormone receptor (GHR), the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and the thrombopoietin receptor9. All these receptors lack intrinsic kinase activity, making them dependent on associated kinases such as the Janus kinases (JAKs) to mediate signalling9. They are single-pass transmembrane (TM) proteins with similar overall topologies: (1) a folded extracellular domain (ECD) responsible for ligand binding; (2) a TM domain (TMD) connecting the extracellular- and intracellular parts and (3) an intrinsically disordered intracellular domain (ICD) orchestrating downstream signalling910. Their ECDs fold into two fibronectin type III domains, named D1 (membrane-distal) and D2 (membrane-proximal). The latter contains a conserved WS-motif11 that for the PRLR acts as a molecular switch during activation12. The ICDs have low-sequence conservation, except for two regions named Box1 and Box2. Box1 is a membrane-proximal proline-rich motif responsible for constitutive association of JAKs13, while the function of Box2 remains unclear, although some studies have suggested it to be involved in JAK2 association131415. Recently, studies have revealed that homodimerization of group I cytokine receptors may occur in the absence of hormone, and is insufficient for receptor activation161718. Binding of a hormone to the ECDs leads to the formation of an asymmetric ternary complex consisting of one hormone and two receptor chains192021. Parts of the PRL/PRLR receptor system have been structurally characterized including structures of the PRL22, the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes of PRL:PRLR-ECD161718 and the unliganded human (h) PRLR-ECD-D2 (ref. 12), as well as a recent characterization of the hPRLR-ICD as being intrinsically disordered throughout its length10. However, despite substantial efforts, important structural and functional aspects of the PRLR remain uncharacterized. As no structure is available of neither the unliganded PRLR-ECD nor of the TMD, the overall structure and mechanism of signal transfer remains elusive. Signal transduction across the membrane following hormone binding is suggested to occur by subunit rearrangements or propagation of local structural changes, providing the TMDs with a key role. Furthermore, it has been shown for several class 1 cytokine receptors that the ligand-independent homodimerization takes place in the TMDs161718. Despite these significant roles, the TMDs remain largely understudied, although cellular reports on their characteristics and roles in signal transduction are now emerging. A recent study of the GHR proposed a model for signal transduction where the homodimer TMD conformation switches upon receptor activation from a parallel to a left-hand crossover structure, thereby separating the TMDs at the C-terminal end and eventually bringing the two JAK2s into productive positions17. However, analogous alanine-insertion studies of the GHR23 and the PRLR24 suggested that the activation mechanism of the two related receptors differs in a poorly understood manner. Although high-resolution structures of multi-pass transmembrane proteins in connection with extra-membranous globular domains have been solved (for example, refs 25, 26), no such structures are available of single-pass transmembrane proteins, which have fewer stabilizing contacts in their membrane-embedded region. The structural characterization of the full PRLR is further hampered by the challenges associated with studies of a protein consisting of three structurally diverse domains: a soluble, folded domain, a membrane-embedded domain and an intrinsically disordered domain. Currently, no single high-resolution method is capable of describing the structural characteristics of a protein of this size and complexity. To overcome these inherent limitations in sample preparation and individual structure-determination techniques, we here apply a multidisciplinary divide-and-conquer approach in which we combine data acquired with different techniques on overlapping domain variants of the hPRLR with molecular modelling. In the centre of this endeavour lies the determination of the hPRLR-TMD structure, which we here solve in 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (DHPC) micelles using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Combining this with previously published and new biophysical data of the soluble domains, we generate a structural model of the monomeric hPRLR, suggested to represent up to 70% of the PRLRs in the cell membrane15. This hPRLR structure provides the first full molecular architecture of a class I cytokine receptor, exemplifying more than 40 different receptor chains, and reveals that the extracellular domain is merely the tip of a molecular iceberg. RESULTS. STRUCTURE OF HPRLR-TMD IN MICELLES. As the missing piece in the structural description of the hPRLR, we determined the structure of the TMD in a membrane-mimicking environment using solution state NMR spectroscopy. To ensure overlap with previously determined structures, we used a hPRLR-TMD construct with a five-residue overlap between hPRLR-D2 (ref. 12) and hPRLR-TMD in its N-terminus (F206-D210), and a five-residue overlap with hPRLR-ICD10 in its C-terminus (G236-V240).

27187005,"Calcineurin in a Crowded World. Calcineurin (CaN) is a calmodulin (CaM)-activated protein Ser/Thr phosphatase that was discovered in the laboratories of Wang and Desai, and Klee and Krinks. Initially thought to be expressed only in neurons (hence the name), CaN is now known to be expressed ubiquitously. CaN is a key regulator of processes such as activation of the immune system, neuronal plasticity, and heart growth. CaN mediates immune system activation through its action on members of the transcription factor family nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), for example, NFAT1 and NFAT2. Once dephosphorylated, these transcription factors translocate to the nucleus where they upregulate the expression of cytokines IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-γ, which are important for further immune system stimulation. As a result of infection and initiation of the CaN/NFAT-dependent pathway release of these cytokines, patients can experience symptoms of inflammation, including fever that typically ranges from 38 to 42 °C. CaN is a heterodimeric protein composed of a catalytic A chain (57–61 kDa) and a regulatory B chain (19 kDa). From the N-terminus to the C-terminus, the A chain of CaN contains the catalytic domain, the B chain-binding helix, and regulatory and autoinhibitory domains. The catalytic domain of the A chain contains all the molecular machinery necessary for CaN’s catalytic function as a phosphatase. Extending out from the catalytic domain is a helix to which the regulatory B chain binds. The regulatory domain (RD) is an ∼100-residue domain that contains the CaM-binding site. The autoinhibitory domain (AID) of CaN occludes the catalytic site of the catalytic domain in CaN’s inactive state. The B chain of CaN is structurally homologous to CaM and is capable of binding up to four Ca2+ cations. In the resting cell, the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ranges from 50 to 100 nM and is insufficient for CaN activation. In the inactive state of CaN, the AID occludes the catalytic site, preventing binding of phosphorylated residues. It was suggested by Yang and Klee that the RD is folded onto the interface between the A and B chains, which would prevent CaM binding (Figure 1A). These authors showed that the RD, which contains the CaM-binding site, in full-length CaN is protected from limited digestion by trypsin and chymotrypsin in the absence of Ca2+. This was not the case for Ca2+-bound CaN. Upon the influx of Ca2+ (e.g., triggered by T-cell receptors binding to an antigen), CaN undergoes a multistep conformational change that results in full activation. Ca2+ binds to the B chain, causing dissociation of the RD from the A chain–B chain interface (Figure 1B). Release of the RD results in the domain becoming disordered, exposing the CaM-binding site. Concurrently, CaM can bind four Ca2+ cations and the newly accessible CaM-binding site. Upon CaM binding, the RD undergoes a conformational change that removes the AID from the catalytic site and results in full activation (Figure 1C). It was first suggested by Manalan and Klee that the RD containing the CaM-binding site is intrinsically disordered in Ca2+-bound CaN. The RD and AID in full-length CaN in the presence of Ca2+ were readily digested in limited proteolysis experiments. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry (HD/MS) and circular dichroism (CD) analyses performed in our laboratory showed that a protein construct of the RD alone was intrinsically disordered. We also observed that CaM binding led the RD to fold. It was known that CaM interacts with an ∼24-residue sequence located in the N-terminal half of the RD (residues 391–414), and that CaM binds to this region with a high affinity (KD = 1–28 pM). The HD/MS experiments detected a second RD region (residues 441–459), ∼27 residues downstream of the CaM-binding site, that also folds upon association with CaM. CD data revealed this distal structured region to be helical. Thus, this was named the distal helix. The sequence of the distal helix region suggested that it was an amphipathic α-helix, and it is hypothesized that the hydrophobic face interacts with CaM. To investigate the structure of the distal helix, the isolated RD was expressed and purified. CD measurements of the wild-type RD construct in the presence of CaM revealed that the distal helix had a Tm of 38 °C, close to human body temperature of 37 °C. To further probe distal helix formation, glutamate point mutations (A447E, A451E, and A545E) were introduced into the putative hydrophobic face of the amphipathic α-helix. Glutamate was chosen to replace the native alanines because glutamate both introduces a negative charge and is significantly larger. We hypothesized that this would disrupt interactions with CaM and weaken distal helix formation. Because these mutations were outside of the CaM-binding region, CaM could still bind to the RD with high affinity. RD constructs that contained Ala-to-Glu mutations were found to have significantly weakened, if not abolished, folding of the distal helix. The functional role of the distal helix was assessed by introducing the same disruptive Ala-to-Glu mutations into the distal helix in full-length CaN and determining the effects on enzymatic activity. Two substrates are typically used to assess the enzymatic activity of CaN, p-nitrophenol phosphate (pNPP), a generic small-molecule phosphatase substrate, and RII, which is a phosphorylated peptide derived from an endogenous substrate of CaN, protein kinase-A regulatory subunit type II (PKA RII). Analysis of CaN constructs containing Ala-to-Glu mutations revealed that distal helix formation is required for full and robust activity of CaN against both pNPP and RII substrates. Michaelis–Menten analyses of the enzymatic assay data suggested that disruption of the distal helix allowed the AID to occupy the active site of the catalytic domain of CaN, thereby directly inhibiting pNPP and RII binding. Interestingly, the Tm of the distal helix is 38 °C, which is close to that of t",PMC,pos,1,pos,4217,pos_PMC,0.947186,1
27232663,"Dissecting the Binding between Glutamine Synthetase and Its Two Natively Unfolded Protein Inhibitors. Ammonium is incorporated into carbon skeletons by the sequential action of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) in cyanobacteria. The activity of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 GS type I is controlled by protein-protein interactions with two intrinsically disordered inactivating factors (IFs): the 65-residue (IF7) and the 149-residue one (IF17). In this work, we studied both IF7 and IF17 by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and we described their binding to GS by using NMR and biolayer interferometry. We assigned the backbone nuclei of all residues of IF7. Analyses of chemical shifts and the (15)N-{(1)H} NOEs at two field strengths suggest that IF7 region Thr3-Arg13 and a few residues around Ser27 and Phe41 populated helical conformations (although the percentage is smaller around Phe41). The two-dimensional (1)H-(15)N HSQC and CON experiments suggest that IF17 populated several conformations. We followed the binding between GS and IF7 by NMR at physiological pH, and the residues interacting first with IF7 were Gln6 and Ser27, belonging to those regions that appeared to be ordered in the isolated protein. We also determined the kon values and koff values for the binding of both IF7 and IF17 to GS, where the GS protein was bound to a biosensor. The measurements of the kinetic constants for the binding of IF7 to GS suggest that: (i) binding does not follow a kinetic two-state model ([Formula: see text]), (ii) there is a strong electrostatic component in the determined kon, and (iii) the binding is not diffusion-limited.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4230,pos_MEDLINE,0.9974291,1
27242421,"Cell-Type Dependent Effect of Surface-Patterned Microdot Arrays on Neuronal Growth. INTRODUCTION. Micro-contact printing of biologically active materials on the surface of culture substrates has been widely applied to various neurobiological assays and neural interface designs to facilitate control of the extracellular microenvironment in vitro. Investigating survival and growth of neurons on patterned substrates is a simple yet highly effective way to unravel the interaction between neurons and extracellular molecules, such as proteins (Chiang et al., 2011; Poudel et al., 2013) or synthetic biomaterials (Liu et al., 2008; Chien and Tsai, 2012). As the height of contact-printed patterns is ~10 nm (Ryu et al., 2016), which exerts a negligible effect on neuronal growth (Baranes et al., 2012), contact-printed patterns were useful to investigate the chemical interaction in neural interface without the topographic effect of surface. Furthermore, the selective neuronal responses to the specific geometry of micropatterns have enabled us to manipulate the initiation and growth of neurites, particularly axons, to the desired direction in nerve regeneration studies, neural tissue engineering, and neural circuit design (Fricke et al., 2011; Jang and Nam, 2012; Hart et al., 2013). Most of the micropattern-based studies have been executed using long-projecting excitatory neurons, such as hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Liu et al., 2008; Jang and Nam, 2012), cortical neurons (Fricke et al., 2011; Hart et al., 2013), or peripheral ganglion neurons (von Philipsborn et al., 2006). Interestingly, several studies have reported that the responses of neurons to the underlying micropattern differ according to the intrinsic properties of the neuron. For example, VonPhilipsborn et al. showed that nasal retinal neurons grow continuously on ephrin gradient patterns, whereas temporal retinal neurons stop growing at the specific level of the gradient. Therefore, as the morphological characteristics of neurons inherently differ from each other, the same micropattern could have different effects in different types of neurons. Furthermore, different host animals may also affect the results, even if the neurons were isolated from the same region. In order to investigate the effect of controlled conditions on cell behaviors, an array of microdots has been often employed due to its controllability. A microdot array is easy to realize various microenvironmental conditions with different size and spacing (Chen et al., 1997; von Philipsborn et al., 2006; Fricke et al., 2011). Using different proteins enables controlling the chemical compositions of cellular microenvironment (Ryu et al., 2016). If the patterns become subcellular nanometer scale, it is also possible to control focal adhesion points applicable for mechanotransduction studies (Horzum et al., 2014). It has been reported that the design of microdot arrays determined cell fate in stem cell differentiation (Tonazzini et al., 2013; Yennek et al., 2014; Amin et al., 2016), cell migration (Lehnert et al., 2004; Andersen et al., 2015), and distinct features of cancer cells (Horzum et al., 2015). In case of neuronal cells, patterning various synaptic proteins recruited the counterparts of synaptic proteins in a cultured neuron, thereby facilitating synapse formation assays in the culture condition (Czöndör et al., 2013). Here we compared the effect of the same micropattern on early growth of several types of neurons in culture. We previously reported the branching initiation effect of microdot arrays using mouse hippocampal neurons (Kim et al., 2014), which also showed that morphological features, such as neurite length and branch number, of mouse hippocampal neurons did not change significantly on the microdot arrays. In this study, however, mouse spinal interneurons (same host animal but different neuronal types) and rat hippocampal neurons (same neuronal type but different host animal) revealed that both neurons reacted differently to the same microdot arrays; unlike the mouse hippocampal neurons, the mouse spinal interneurons extended major neurite longer, whereas the rat hippocampal neurons formed more branches. To clarify whether the distinct responses of the two neuronal types to microdot arrays rely on pattern designs, we diversified the size and spacing of microdot arrays to investigate the changes in the morphological responses of both neuron types on all combinations of microdot arrays. In most cases, the overall growth of neurons tended to be promoted on the denser microdot arrays and restricted on the sparser ones, regardless of neuronal type. However, the specific responses of each neuron, such as early elongation of the major neurite in mouse spinal interneurons and branching augmentation in rat hippocampal neurons, were preserved in the same range of microdot arrays, suggesting the presence of cell-type dependency in the neuron-micropattern interaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS. FABRICATION OF MICRODOT ARRAYS. The microdot arrays were designed with a combination of three diameters (3, 5, and 10 μm) and four spacings (3, 5, 10, and 20 μm). Spacing indicates the distance between dot edges. A silicon mold was fabricated by photolithography using the SU8-2002 photoresist (Microchem, Woburn, MA, USA). After silanization of the silicon mold with (1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorooctyl) trichlorosilane (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 45 min, the mixture of polydimethoxysilane (PDMS) prepolymer and curing agent (Dow Corning, Corning, NY, USA) was poured into the mold. The PDMS was cured for more than 2 h in an oven (60°C) and was gently released from the mold. Next, it was cut into several pieces (1 × 1 cm2) and used as a stamp for the printing procedure. A conventional micro-contact printing procedure was employed to print the microdot arrays on the culture substrates (Figure 1A). First, the stamps were sequentially washed with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and triple-distilled water with ultra-sonication for 5 min each. Then, the stamp was submerged",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,4233,far_neg_PMC,0.0018422535,0
27317979,"Role of N-terminal region of Escherichia coli maltodextrin glucosidase in folding and function of the protein. Maltodextrin glucosidase (MalZ) hydrolyses short malto-oligosaccharides from the reducing end releasing glucose and maltose in Escherichia coli. MalZ is a highly aggregation prone protein and molecular chaperonins GroEL and GroES assist in the folding of this protein to a substantial level. The N-terminal region of this enzyme appears to be a unique domain as seen in sequence comparison studies with other amylases as well as through homology modelling. The sequence and homology model analysis show a probability of disorder in the N-Terminal region of MalZ. The crystal structure of this enzyme has been reported in the present communication. Based on the crystallographic structure, it has been interpreted that the N-terminal region of the enzyme (Met1-Phe131) might be unstructured or flexible. To understand the role of the N-terminal region of MalZ in its enzymatic activity, and overall stability, a truncated version (Ala111-His616) of MalZ was created. The truncated version failed to fold into an active enzyme both in E. coli cytosol and in vitro even with the assistance of chaperonins GroEL and GroES. Furthermore, the refolding effort of N-truncated MalZ in the presence of isolated N-terminal domain didn't succeed. Our studies suggest that while the structural rigidity or orientation of the N-terminal region of the MalZ protein may not be essential for its stability and function, but the said domain is likely to play an important role in the formation of the native structure of the protein when present as an integral part of the protein.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4250,pos_MEDLINE,0.995142,1
27325746,"eIF1A/eIF5B interaction network and its functions in translation initiation complex assembly and remodeling. INTRODUCTION. Eukaryotic translation initiation is a multistep process involving ribosomes, mRNAs, tRNAs and a number of proteins called eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs). The key stages of translation initiation are: (i) assembly of a 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC) on the small, 40S ribosomal subunit; (ii) binding of the 43S PIC to mRNA; (iii) scanning by the PIC along the mRNA in search of the start codon; (iv) start codon selection through basepairing of the initiator Met-tRNAi with mRNA to form the 48S PIC; and (v) ribosomal subunit joining, yielding the 80S initiation complex (80S IC). Start codon selection and ribosomal subunit joining are controlled by the G-proteins eIF2 and eIF5B, respectively, and require multiple proteins, including eIF1A, a protein with pleiotropic functions in virtually all stages of translation initiation (reviewed in (1–5)). eIF1A has an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold domain and two flexible intrinsically disordered tails (6): a positively charged N-terminal tail (NTT) and a negatively charged C-terminal tail (CTT) (Figure 1A). eIF1A binds to the A-site on the 40S ribosomal subunit with its two tails extending into the P-site (7–10). Upon start codon recognition, eIF1A-NTT remains in the P-site while eIF1A-CTT is displaced (7,11). eIF5B contains four conserved domains in its C-terminal half (D1–D4) (Figure 1B), the first of which, D1 is the GTPase domain (12–14). The N-terminal region is less conserved and is not essential in vitro in mammalian or yeast systems, or in vivo in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12,13). Upon start codon recognition, eIF5B displaces eIF2-GDP from Met-tRNAi (15) and promotes ribosomal subunit joining, together with eIF1A. Ribosomal subunit joining triggers GTP hydrolysis by eIF5B (13), followed by the coordinated release of eIF5B and eIF1A (16). eIF1A-CTT binds to eIF5B-D4 (17,18), and the interaction is important for subunit joining and for release of eIF1A and eIF5B (16,19–20). The two proteins occupy adjacent sites on the ribosome, bringing eIF5B-D3 near the eIF1A-OB domain (7,21), but no interaction between these regions has been reported in eukaryotes. It has been reported, however, that bacterial IF1 and IF2 (the homologs of eIF1A and eIF5B, respectively), can be cross-linked to each other when part of the translation IC. The cross-linking was mapped to a segment encompassing IF2 domains D2 and D3 (22). It has been proposed, based on Cryo-EM data, that IF1 contacts the linker between IF2-D2 and D3 (23), whereas recent Cryo-EM reconstructions observe contacts between IF1 and IF2-D3 (24). Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDPRs) are unfolded and dynamic under native conditions. IDPs and IDPRs have been found to play important roles and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. IDPRs often contain binding sites for other proteins and ligands and can fold upon binding to their target. A less well known fact is that IDPRs can be involved in dynamic interactions while remaining unfolded and flexible (reviewed in (25–28)). We recently reported that in the bacteriophage T7 ssDNA-binding protein gp2.5, the negatively charged intrinsically disordered CTT dynamically contacts the DNA-binding surface and binds to the T7 DNA polymerase. Deletion of the tail increases the affinity for ssDNA and allows gp2.5 to also bind dsDNA (29). gp2.5 has an OB-fold domain with structure homology to the eIF1A OB domain. Sequence/structure-specific nucleic acid-binding proteins tend to have significant non-specific affinity for any nucleic acid. Thus, the intramolecular contacts in gp2.5 play a dual role: they reduce the non-specific, dsDNA-binding affinity, as well as coordinate ssDNA binding with binding of other proteins to the gp2.5 CTT (29). Similar to gp2.5, deleting the CTT of yeast eIF1A increases its affinity for the 40S ribosomal subunit (30), and eIF1A tends to self-associate at high protein concentrations at physiological salt, but not at high salt. These observations led to the hypotheses that the conserved intrinsically disordered eIF1A-CTT may contact the eIF1A ribosome-binding surface, and that these intramolecular interactions may modulate the interactions of eIF1A with other proteins. Here we report that eIF1A-CTT does indeed dynamically contact the ribosome-binding surface of the eIF1A-OB domain. We also observed an intramolecular interaction between eIF5B-D3 and -D4. eIF5B-D3 binds weakly to eIF1A-OB, but only in the absence of eIF1A-CTT. The intramolecular interactions, both within eIF1A and within eIF5B, weaken the interaction between eIF1A-CTT and eIF5B-D4. Our results show that the affinity between eIF1A and eIF5B on the ribosome is much greater than that between the free proteins in solution. Since eIF1A and eIF5B bind to adjacent sites on the ribosome, their effective concentrations with respect to each other would also be increased, further stabilizing their interaction. We present a model for the interactions within and between eIF1A and eIF5B, their dynamic remodeling at various stages of translation initiation and their respective roles in the process.

A ""Privileg"" for a pharmacy in Gersfeld (Rhoen) was issued October 26, 1788 by the ruler of Gersfeld, the Reichsfreiherr Amand von Ebersberg (1747- 1803), to Peter Franz Wilhelm Feuchter (1766-1835). Feuchter was not only a dedicated pharmacist but also scholarly active both by publishing and by serving on various journal editorial boards. Vitus Jacobus Metz (1792-1866) was accepted 1808 as an apprentice in the pharmacy and later enjoyed private lessons from Feuchter (until around 1813, when he gave up the study of pharmacy to pursue medical studies in Würzburg). This major decision was possibly influenced by Metz experiencing the outcome of a dispute between pharmacist Feuchter and the physician Andreas Laubreis (*1778), dispute with an outcome favoring the physician. As a physician Metz great achievement was to establish 1830 the Mariannen-Institut, the lying-in asylum in Aachen, Bendelstrasse, the first such institution in Germany. How revolutionary and way ahead of its time the Mariannen-Institut really was can only be understood considering that it took over half a century until a similar institution, the second one in Germany, opened in Düsseldorf.

27363037,"IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC EFFECT OF SPIRAMYCIN IN EXPERIMENTAL GIARDIASIS. Giardiasis is a major global cause of water borne diarrheal disease, which contributes greatly to the burden of malnutrition and malabsorption especially in children. There is a great demand for a new effective therapeutic agent against giardiasis that can be used safely during pregnancy, lactation and in infants. In the present study, the therapeutic effect of spiramycin as well as its immunomodulatory mechanism of action in giardiasis had been investigated. 90 Swiss albino mice were used in this study and classified into 3 groups: GI: 40 mice infected with Giardia lamblia cysts, GII: 40 infected mice that received spiramycin treatment in a daily oral dose of 1000 IU/gm body weight for one week starting one week post infection and GIII: 10 control uninfected untreated mice. 20 mice from each infected group were sacrificed 2 weeks post infection (p.i.) and the remaining mice were sacrificed 4 weeks p.i. Mice of the control groups were sacrificed at one time. The antigiardial therapeutic efficacy of spiramycin was assessed 2 and 4 weeks p.i. by counting of Giardia cysts in stool of mice and studying the histopathological changes and disaccharidase activity in small intestine of mice of different groups. Significant reduction in cysts number shedded in stool of treated animals reached 95.73%. The histopathological changes were mild in all infected groups 2 weeks p.i., while 4 weeks p.i. There was also a significant increase in the number of IELs in treated groups denoting the stimulatory effect of spiramycin on lymphocytic proliferation. On studying the disaccharidase activity, there was significant increase in both sucrase and maltase activities in the treated groups as compared with the nontreated groups. The possible immunomodulatory mechanism of action of spiramycin was studied by measuring the local IgA deposition in small intestinal mucosa by PAP technique 4 weeks p.i. The levels of IgA in small intestine were higher in SP-treated group as compared with the non-treated group.

27402840,"Accessory Interaction Motifs in the Atg19 Cargo Receptor Enable Strong Binding to the Clustered Ubiquitin-related Atg8 Protein. INTRODUCTION. Autophagy is a homeostatic and cell-protective lysosomal degradation pathway in eukaryotic cells. Autophagy is triggered during lack of nutrients and serves to maintain basic cellular functions by transporting bulk cytoplasmic material into the lytic compartment for degradation in a rather non-selective manner. However, autophagy also has the ability to specifically target harmful components, such as damaged cell organelles, intracellular pathogens, or potentially toxic protein aggregates (1, 2). Macroautophagy (referred to as autophagy hereafter) involves the de novo formation of a specialized double membrane organelle called the autophagosome. Autophagosomes originate from a membrane structure referred to as the isolation membrane or phagophore that gradually encloses cytoplasmic cargo material (3, 4). After their formation, autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes or the vacuole, wherein their inner membrane and the cargo material are degraded. Selectivity of autophagy is conferred by cargo receptors that link the cargo to the isolation membrane because of their ability to simultaneously bind the cargo and the isolation membrane via ATG8 family proteins (1, 5). ATG8 family proteins are a hallmark of many autophagic pathways (6). Although there is only one Atg8 protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, higher eukaryotes have several ATG8 proteins (subdivided in the LC3 and the GABARAP groups) (7). Atg8 localizes to the isolation membrane and the completed autophagosome and is delivered to the lytic compartment (4, 8). It is attached to the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine by an ubiquitin-like conjugation reaction (9). The binding of cargo receptors to ATG8 family proteins is conferred by so-called LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) (10). The core of the LIR motifs are peptides of four amino acids. In a canonical LIR motif of an Atg8-interactor, an aromatic amino acid at position 1 is separated by two varying amino acids from a hydrophobic amino acid at position 4 (1W/F/Y-XX-4L/I/V) (11–15). Upon Atg8 binding, the aromatic and hydrophobic residues are inserted into two hydrophobic pockets of Atg8. Atg8 consists of an ubiquitin-like fold (Ubl) with two additional N-terminal α helices. The first hydrophobic pocket of Atg8 typically accommodates the aromatic residue at position 1 of canonical LIR motifs and is formed by α2 and β sheet 2 of the Ubl fold (12). It is also referred to as the W site because initial studies investigated the structural basis of receptor-ATG8 family protein binding with the LIR motifs of Atg19 (412WEEL415) and p62 (338WTHL341), which have a tryptophan at position 1 (11–13). Also, phenylalanine or tyrosine residues in various cargo receptors can bind into this pocket (1, 10, 14). The second hydrophobic pocket, the so-called L site, is formed in the Ubl domain by β2 and α3. The hydrophobic residue at position 4 of the canonical LIR motif inserts into this pocket. In addition to these hydrophobic interactions, LIR motifs form an intermolecular β sheet with ATG8 family proteins (12). Further interactions are mediated by residues outside the four-amino acid core of the LIR motif (11–14). In S. cerevisiae, the autophagy-like cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway mediates the delivery of the Ape1 (16), Ape4 (17), and Ams1 (18) hydrolases into the vacuole, where they fulfill their enzymatic function. Atg19 serves as cargo receptor in the Cvt pathway and directly interacts with the cargo and Atg8 on the isolation membrane (19–21). The major cargo of the Cvt pathway is Ape1, which is synthesized in the cytoplasm as zymogen (prApe1) with an N-terminal propeptide (22) and is tightly bound by Atg19 (19). The Cvt pathway is a constitutive process and occurs in the absence of other autophagic stimuli. The membranes of Cvt vesicles are closely aligned to the prApe1 cargo (3, 23, 24). As a result, other non-cargo cytoplasmic material is excluded from these vesicles. Upon induction of autophagy by starvation, the prApe1 cargo is also tethered to the autophagosomal membrane in an Atg19-dependent manner, but other cytoplasmic material is not excluded from the larger autophagosomes (3). It was shown previously that Atg19 harbors multiple Atg8 binding sites in its C-terminal domain and that multiple Atg8 binding sites are required for the Cvt pathway but not for Ape1 transport via autophagosomes (24). One of these Atg8 binding sites is the canonical C-terminal LIR motif (412WEEL415) (12). The mutation of residues in two further LIR-like sequences, 376FYSF379 and 384LPEL387, also affected Atg8 binding, and simultaneous mutation of the canonical and the two LIR-like motifs rendered the interaction of the Atg19 C terminus with Atg8 undetectable (24). However, it was unclear whether the 376FYSF379 and 384LPEL387 motifs interact directly with Atg8 and, if so, whether they bind to the same sites in Atg8 as the canonical LIR 412WEEL415 motif. Here we show, using NMR spectroscopy, that peptides containing the 376FYSF379 and 384LPEL387 motifs interact directly with regions of Atg8 that are overlapping with the binding site for the canonical 412WEEL415 motif. The affinity of the two non-canonical motifs for Atg8 is lower than that of the canonical LIR motif and, hence, we term them accessory LIR motifs. In a microscopy-based protein-protein interaction assay, we further show that these accessory LIR motifs contribute to the interaction of the Atg19 C terminus with Atg8. We also demonstrate that the integrity of these accessory LIRs is important for the Cvt pathway in S. cerevisiae. We propose that multiple low-affinity interactions mediate strong binding of Atg19 to clustered Atg8 and, thus, specific interaction of Atg19 with the isolation membrane on which Atg8 is concentrated. RESULTS. To interrogate the interaction of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Atg19 with Atg8, we employed two-dimensional 15N HSQC by titrating the C-terminal domain of Atg19 (amino acids 365–415, Fig. 1) into",PMC,pos,1,pos,4271,pos_PMC,0.9966168,1
27411375,"A C2HC zinc finger is essential for the RING-E2 interaction of the ubiquitin ligase RNF125. The modification of proteins by ubiquitination is a versatile mechanism that regulates almost every cellular process either through the destruction of target proteins or the spatial or temporal alteration of their functions1. The specificity of this posttranslational modification is determined by the ubiquitin ligases or E3s that recruit the substrates to which ubiquitin becomes covalently attached2. Consistent with this role, the E3s comprise a large diverse group of proteins that share the ability to interact with an E2, or ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, via a domain that is most frequently a RING, U-box or HECT domain3. Mechanistically, the E3s fall into two categories, those that covalently bind ubiquitin before transferring it to a substrate, as is the case for the HECT and the RING RBR E3s, and those that do not form a covalent ubiquitin-intermediate, as is the case for the U-box proteins and the majority of the RING E3s. Of these, the RING domain proteins are the largest group with more than 500 highly diverse members encoded in mammalian genomes4. Major insights into the mechanism by which RING E3s stimulate the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 to a substrate without covalently binding ubiquitin themselves, have been obtained from structural studies of RING (and U-box) domains associated with ubiquitin-loaded E2s567. This demonstrated that RING domains exert allosteric effects on E2-Ub conjugates, stabilizing a closed conformation whereby ubiquitin is positioned on the E2 in a manner that is optimal for nucleophilic attack at the thioester bond by a lysine of the substrate8910. Nevertheless, it is also clear that in many cases the presence of a RING domain is not sufficient and additional events are needed, or significantly enhance the function of ubiquitin ligases11. These regulatory mechanisms are still being defined, but various principles can be distinguished such as a requirement for homodimerization (e.g. RNF4, BIRC7, XIAP, and IDOL)5121314, heterodimerization (e.g. in Mdm2-MdmX, BRCA1-BARD1, RING1B-Bmi1)15161718, or the binding of small molecules (sphingosine-1-phosphate binding to TRAF219 or PAR binding to RNF146)20. Additionally, a role has been described for auxiliary elements of E3s in enhancing ubiquitin release from the E2, either through binding to the E2 (e.g. for gp782122 and AO7)23 or to the donor ubiquitin on the E2 (e.g in Cbl)24. To obtain new insights into regulatory structures of ubiquitin ligases, we have studied the RING protein RNF125 (previously called TRAC-1). RNF125 was first identified as a regulator of T cell activation25, but has also been shown to negatively regulate the cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA526, to interfere with HIV transcription27 and promote p53 degradation28. Furthermore, variations in RNF125 gene expression levels have been linked to progression of HIV infection29, and resistance of melanoma cells to B-raf inhibitors30. Recently, mutations in RNF125 have been associated with a new overgrowth syndrome, characterized by macrocephaly as well as inflammatory disease31. These diverse roles of RNF125 remain to be further understood. RNF125 is a small protein (25 kD) that contains, in addition to the RING domain, three zinc fingers (ZnFs) and a ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM) (Fig. 1A). So far, only the interactions via the RING and UIM with E2s and ubiquitin, respectively, have been demonstrated32. The in vitro ubiquitination activity of RNF125 is readily detectable and in cells, this activity correlates with low steady state levels and a short half-life32. RNF125 belongs to a protein family with three related members, RNF114, RNF138 and RNF16632 that, despite similarities in size, amino acid sequence and domain organization, differ considerably in activity. This is especially the case for RNF114, a psoriasis susceptibility gene product3334, which has very low activity compared to RNF12533. This difference in activity between RNF125 and RNF114 was the starting point of our study and led, through the generation of chimeras and stop mutants, to the identification of an essential role of the C2HC ZnF in the activity of RNF125, and a contributing, non-essential role for a linker region. NMR experiments demonstrated that the establishment of RING interactions with the E2 depends on the presence of these auxiliary regions. X-ray crystallography showed interactions between the RING and C2HC ZnF, whilst mutations at one of these contact residues, M112, resulted in an inhibition of ubiquitin ligase activity, elucidating an important structural role of the C2HC ZnF. We conclude that the RING and C2HC ZnF form a functional unit that is required for binding to the E2. RESULTS. THE RING DOMAIN OF RNF125 IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR ACTIVITY. We previously compared the in vitro ubiquitination activity of RNF125 to that of its relative RNF114 using proteins immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK293T cells33. These reactions, performed in the presence of UbcH5a/b/c as E2 proteins, showed significantly higher activity for RNF125 than for RNF114. Here, we performed these reactions with GST-fusion proteins purified from Escherichia coli and found an even greater difference, with the activity of RNF114 being virtually undetectable (Fig. 2A). This indicated that intrinsic features of the proteins are responsible for this difference. To compare RNF125 and RNF114 proteins further, we made chimeras, exchanging the N-terminal unique domain and RING domain of RNF114 with the same part of RNF125, and vice versa (Fig. 1B, see Supplementary Fig. S1 for a sequence comparison of RNF125 and RNF114). The chimera with the RING domain of RNF114, RNF1141-68/RNF125, showed very little in vitro ubiquitin ligase activity consistent with the lower activity of RNF114 (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, the chimera with the RING domain of RNF125, RNF1251-75/RNF114, was also inactive despite this RING domain being indispensable for RNF125 activity3235.

27415281,"Emergence of coexisting percolating clusters in networks. It is commonly assumed in percolation theories that at most one percolating cluster can exist in a network. We show that several coexisting percolating clusters (CPCs) can emerge in networks due to limited mixing, i.e., a finite and sufficiently small number of interlinks between network modules. We develop an approach called modular message passing (MMP) to describe and verify these observations. We demonstrate that the appearance of CPCs is an important source of inaccuracy in previously introduced percolation theories, such as the message passing (MP) approach, which is a state-of-the-art theory based on the belief propagation method. Moreover, we show that the MMP theory improves significantly over the predictions of MP for percolation on synthetic networks with limited mixing and also on several real-world networks. These findings have important implications for understanding the robustness of networks and in quantifying epidemic outbreaks in the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model of disease spread.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,4275,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.002157342,0
27461042,"Leveraging Mechanisms Governing Pancreatic Tumorigenesis To Reduce Pancreatic Cancer Mortality. PANCREATIC CANCER IS A HIGHLY RECALCITRANT MALIGNANCY. Pancreatic cancer has an overall 5-year survival rate of 7–8% and will account for 41,780 estimated deaths this year to become the 3rd leading cause of cancer mortality in the USA [1]. A majority (>85%) of pancreatic cancers are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), histologically characterized by ductular differentiation and highly fibrotic (or desmoplastic) stromal reaction. PDA is highly resistant to current standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens, which offer only modest survival benefit for most patients [2]. PDA patients also commonly suffer from debilitating cachexia and other co-morbidities that negatively impact their performance status, further limiting treatment options [3]. With symptoms manifesting late and no reliable screening test, a majority of PDA patients (~80%) are diagnosed at an advanced, non-operable clinical stage. Even early-stage patients who undergo successful surgical resection are likely to succumb to recurrent regional or metastatic disease within 2–5 years [4]. After years of clinical trial failures, modest improvements in survival have been finally realized for advanced stage PDA through the use of multi-agent chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Numerous additional clinical trials are addressing the efficacy of these and other promising combinations of chemotherapy in all (early and late) stages of disease [2, 5]. However, innovations in early cancer detection and systemic therapies are clearly needed to achieve robust and sustained treatment outcomes. In the context of these important clinical challenges, we highlight recent work detailing the molecular and cellular features governing pancreatic tumorigenesis. TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF PDA AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EARLY DETECTION. The temporal and stepwise accumulation of molecular and histologic alterations during dysplastic progression is well documented in patient samples and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) [6]. Three well-described dysplastic lesions precede the development of PDA. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) are microscopic ductular lesions that give rise to most invasive PDA. Macroscopic cystic or mass-forming ductular lesions involving or separate from the pancreatic ductal system include intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCNs), respectively. Although unproven, acinar-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and atypical flat duct lesions are additional proposed direct histologic precursors of invasive PDA [7]. Recent whole exome sequencing of patient-matched PDA primary and metastatic lesions from surgical and autopsy specimens has offered important insights into the evolution and progression of PDA. Subclonal heterogeneity in a primary tumor correlates with clonal evolution of metastatic lesions [8] and may be a source of treatment resistance via selective pressure. Modeling of subclonal genetic evolution based on cellular proliferation rates in human PDA estimates a timeline of more than 10 years between an initiating oncogenic event and a parental clone that gives rise to a primary tumor, as well as an additional 6–7 years before the development of metastatic foci [8]—a large window of potential opportunity to detect PDA at an earlier stage when treatment could be more effective. Initiatives are underway to identify sensitive and specific biomarkers for early cancer detection in stool, plasma or other biofluids [9]. Unfortunately, the low incidence of PDA precludes practical and cost-effective screening in the general population using present technologies. Therefore, early detection research has focused heavily on screening at-risk populations, including individuals with familial or hereditary forms of PDA, chronic pancreatitis, new-onset diabetes mellitus after age 50, or other composites of risk factors and clinical symptoms [9]. Whether early detection will significantly improve clinical outcomes is uncertain, particularly in view of data suggesting metastasis occurs early in PDA progression. A recent PDA GEMM study tracking fluorescently-tagged pancreatic epithelial cells finds they have already delaminated into pancreatic stroma and entered the circulation at an early stage of PanIN progression before development of frank PDA [10]. These disseminated cells expressed features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stemness [10]. Similarly, circulating epithelial cells can be detected in patients with pre-malignant cystic pancreatic lesions without invasive PDA [11]. Separate computational estimates of human PDA growth and dissemination rates based on radiographic and autopsy data predicts most small primary PDA tumors are associated with subclinical metastatic disease [12]. These findings are consistent with the high rate of metastatic relapse seen in early stage patients after margin-negative surgical resection. Therefore, an early detection biomarker may need to identify a high-risk precursor lesion prior to the onset of invasive PDA to be clinically useful [9]. Furthermore, given the high likelihood of clinically undetected microscopic metastatic disease, neoadjuvant systemic therapy may be warranted prior to surgery even in patients with early-stage, resectable PDA. KRAS: MASTER REGULATOR OF PDA DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE. The literature overwhelmingly supports the notion that KRAS, a GTPase that performs key functions in normal tissue signaling, is the key oncogenic linchpin and a highly desirable therapeutic target for PDA. KRAS IN PDA PROGRESSION. Oncogenic KRAS mutations are frequently detected in early PanINs and nearly ubiquitous in PDA (90–95%) [6]. In isolation, pancreas-specific expression of oncogenic Kras at its endogenous locus leads to the progressive accumulation of murine PanIN (mPanIN) lesions and occasional development of PDA after long latency [13].

27515574,"Interaction between intrinsically disordered regions in transcription factors Sp1 and TAF4. The expression of eukaryotic genes is precisely controlled by specific interactions between general transcription initiation factors and gene-specific transcriptional activators. The general transcription factor TFIID, which plays an essential role in mediating transcriptional activation, is a multisubunit complex comprising the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). On the other hand, biochemical and genetic approaches have shown that the promoter-specific transcriptional activator Sp1 has the ability to interact with one of the components of TFIID, the TBP-associated factor TAF4. We herein report the structural details of the glutamine-rich domains (Q-domains) of Sp1 and TAF4 using circular dichroism (CD) and heteronuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We found that the two Q-domains of Sp1 and four Q-domains of TAF4 were disordered under physiological conditions. We also quantitatively analyzed the interaction between the Q-domains of Sp1 and TAF4 by NMR and surface plasmon resonance, and detected a weak but specific association between them. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis of CD spectra suggested that any significant conformational change did not occur concomitantly with this association, at least at the level of the overall secondary structure. These results may represent a prominent and exceptional binding mode for the IDPs, which are not categorized in a well-accepted concept of ""coupled folding and binding.""",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4299,pos_MEDLINE,0.9980506,1

The study explored the use of IP-10, MCP-1, and IFN-γ as biomarkers to improve the diagnoses of active pulmonary tuberculosis and tuberculous pleurisy. We enrolled 267 individuals, including 134 TB patients, 93 patients with non-tuberculous pulmonary diseases, and 40 healthy controls. Whole bloods were stimulated in vitro with rCFP-10/ESAT-6 protein antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The levels of IFN-γ, IP-10, and MCP-1 in cultured supernatants of whole bloods were detected by a chemiluminescence immunoassay. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to determine the cutoff value for diagnosing TB and to evaluate the diagnostic efficacies of the IFN-γ, IP-10, and MCP-1 for TB. The antigen-specific release of each cytokine, IFN-γ, IP-10, and MCP-1, was significantly higher in the TB groups than in either the non-tuberculous pulmonary disease group (p < 0.001) or the healthy control group (p < 0.001). The ROC curves indicated cutoff values for IFN-γ, IP-10, and MCP-1 at 147.8, 160.4, and 496.4 pg/mL, respectively.

During cytokinesis, the antiparallel array of microtubules forming the central spindle organizes the midbody, a structure that anchors the ingressed cleavage furrow and guides the assembly of abscission machinery. Here, we identified a role for the flavoprotein monooxygenase MICAL3, an actin disassembly factor, in organizing midbody-associated protein complexes. By combining cell biological assays with cross-linking mass spectrometry, we show that MICAL3 is recruited to the central spindle and the midbody through a direct interaction with the centralspindlin component MKLP1. Knock-out of MICAL3 leads to an increased frequency of cytokinetic failure and a delayed abscission. In a mechanism independent of its enzymatic activity, MICAL3 targets the adaptor protein ELKS and Rab8A-positive vesicles to the midbody, and the depletion of ELKS and Rab8A also leads to cytokinesis defects.

27566385,"A new diagnostic approach for bilious pleural effusion. BACKGROUND Bilious pleural effusion is an extremely rare condition associated with liver diseases, subphrenic or subhepatic abscess formation, biliary peritonitis, and invasive procedures (i.e., percutaneous biliary drainage or liver biopsy). The current diagnostic test is based on the measurement of the ratio of pleural total bilirubin to serum total bilirubin, which is greater than 1 in patients with bilious pleural effusion. Given the low incidence of bilious pleural effusion, the precise diagnostic yield of this ratio based test has not been evaluated. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of our institution and searched the PubMed database for reports of bilious pleural effusion. RESULTS We identified a total of 12 cases of bilious pleural effusion (9 from 8 Pubmed reports and 3 from our institutional records). The factors causing this condition were broadly classified into three categories based on the pathophysiology: 1) liver diseases (echinococcosis, tuberculosis and amebiasis); 2) subhepatic/subphrenic abscess or biliary peritonitis, with or without biliary tract obstruction; and 3) iatrogenic disease after percutaneous biliary drainage and/or liver biopsy. The sensitivity of detection was 76.9% when the ratio of pleural total bilirubin to serum total bilirubin was greater than 1. The sensitivity increased to 100% when a combination test including pleural glycoholic acid was adopted. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the high diagnostic yield for bilious pleural effusion using a combination of two test criteria; a ratio of pleural total bilirubin to serum total bilirubin greater than 1 and the presence of pleural glycoholic acid.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,4314,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0021657674,0

Infant mental health is explicitly relational in its focus, and therefore a diagnostic classification system for early childhood disorders should include attention not only to within-the-child psychopathology but also between child and caregiver psychopathology. In this article, we begin by providing a review of previous efforts to introduce this approach that date back more than 30 years. Next, we introduce changes proposed in the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood DC:0-5 (ZERO TO THREE, in press). In a major change from previous attempts, the DC:0-5 includes an Axis I ""Relationship Specific Disorder of Early Childhood."" This disorder intends to capture disordered behavior that is limited to one caregiver relationship rather than cross contextually. An axial characterization is continued from the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood DC:0-3R (ZERO TO THREE, 2005), but two major changes are introduced. First, the DC:0-5 proposes to simplify ratings of relationship adaptation/maladaptation, and to expand what is rated so that in addition to characterizing the child's relationship with his or her primary caregiver, there also is a characterization of the network of family relationships in which the child develops.

27582183,"Crystal structure of the two-subunit tRNA m(1)A58 methyltransferase TRM6-TRM61 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transfer RNA (tRNA), typically 76 to 90 nucleotides in length, is a necessary component of the protein translation machinery12. It serves as a carrier delivering amino acids to the ribosome for protein synthesis. An indispensable role of tRNAs is that they could specify which sequence from the genetic code corresponds to which amino acid3. In eukaryotes, tRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase III as pre-tRNAs. During tRNAs maturation, pre- tRNAs undergo a series of post-transcriptional modifications, including splicing, end- trimming, and base or ribose modifications. These modifications are helpful to stabilize the 3D structure of tRNAs, and are crucial to ensure the translation efficiency and fidelity345. To date, 108 currently known chemical modifications of tRNA have been identified, Of these, the most common and prevalent tRNA modifications is methylation6. Adenine at position 58 (A58) located in the T-loop is one of the most conserved nucleosides in tRNA, and the occurrence of 1-methyladenosine (m1A) at position 58 has been reported from all three kingdoms7. This modification also plays an important biological role in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. For example, tRNA m1A58 modification is required for Thermus thermophilus to survive at high temperatures8. In yeast, inactivation of gene coding for m1A58 tRNA methyltransferase causes the instability of initiator tRNAiMet, and tRNAiMet lacking m1A58 modification is subsequently degraded by nuclear exosome910. Particularly important is that methylated adenine at position 58 in human tRNA3Lys is closely associated with immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Studies have proved that m1A58 modification of tRNA3Lys is required for both efficacy and fidelity of (+) strand DNA transfer during HIV replication1112. The RNA methyltransferases are responsible for this modification, which catalyze the transfer of methyl group from the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to various positions of the nucleotide bases, yielding a methylated RNA and S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH)13. All known RNA methyltransferases can be classified into four superfamilies, including Rossmann-fold, SPOUT, Radical-SAM and FAD/NAD(p)-dependent methyl- transferases1415. The m1A58 tRNA methyltransferase is appropriate for the Rossmann-fold superfamily. Thus far, the crystal structures of four bacterial m1A58 tRNA methyltransferases have been reported, comprising MtTrmI (m1A58 tRNA methyltransferases from Mycobacterium tuberculosis)1617, TtTrmI (m1A58 tRNA methyltransferases from Thurmus thermophilus)18, AaTrmI (m1A58 tRNA methyltransferases from Aquifex aeolicus), and PaTrmI (m1A58 tRNA methyltransferases fromPyrococcus abyssi)1920. These studies indicate that the m1A58 tRNA methyltransferases from bacterial and archaeal consist of one subunit and function as homotetramers. Distinctly different from bacterial and archaeal, the known eukaryotic m1A58 tRNA methyltransferases are composed of two subunits and supposed to function as heterotetramers. In yeast, the two subunits complex TRM6-TRM61 has been identified as the key factor of this methyl transfer reaction2122. Study discloses that S.cerevisiae TRM6-TRM61 complex is vital for the m1A58 modification in the processing and accumulation of tRNAiMet, which is a key initiation step of translation212223. Detailed sequence analysis further demonstrates that TRM61 possesses a typical Rossmann-fold, and shares obvious sequence similarity to the bacterial and archaeal m1A58 tRNA methyltransferase TrmI. In contrast, TRM6 homologs have been identified only in eukaryotes, and no evident sequence similarity with any proteins other than orthologs is found. This unique binary composition of eukaryotic m1A58 tRNA methyl- transferases hints a different mechanism for tRNA recognition and catalysis than its prokaryotic counterparts. In this study, we report the crystal structures of S.cerevisiae TRM6-TRM61 holoenzyme and TRM6-TRM61 in complex with SAM. TRM6 and TRM61 adopt a similar fold, with a high structural similarity to the prokaryotic counterpart TrmI. Differently, the S.cerevisiae TRM6 and TRM61 evolve more structural elements to better suit the 3D conformation of target tRNA. Further, the structural comparison of the wild-type TRM6-TRM61 and TRM6-TRM61-SAM disclose the fine rearrangements of the active site upon SAM binding. When we prepared this manuscript, the structure of TRM6-TRM61-tRNA3Lys-SAM from H. sapiens was reported by Stroud’s group24. Here, our results provide a tRNA-unbound state TRM6-TRM61 holoenzyme, which assists in understanding the conformation change upon tRNA binding occurred in eukaryotes. Taken together, these two structures suggest a hand open-close strategy for eukaryotic tRNA m1A58 methyltransferases to recognize target tRNAs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. OVERALL STRUCTURE OF TRM6-TRM61 HOLOENZYME. To improve understanding the target tRNA recognition and catalytic mechanism of the two component m1A58 tRNA methyl- transferase in eukaryotes, we solved the structure of the TRM6-TRM61 holoenzyme from S. cerevisiae by the SAD method using the Se anomalous signal. The final model has been refined to 2.2 Å resolution and the details of the data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1A, one TRM6-TRM61 heterodimer adopts a rectangular shape with two arms protruding from the core. TRM61, the eukaryotic homologue of the bacterial and archaeal m1A58 tRNA methyl- transferase TrmI, consists of two distinct domains: a small N-terminal domain (residues 4–78) and a large C-terminal domain (residues 79–378). The small N-terminal domain consists of three hairpin β-motifs, which form a β-barrel (Fig. 1C). The large C-terminal domain adopts a typical Rossmann-fold, comprising a central seven-stranded β-sheet flanked by three α-helices on each side (Fig. 1C). The first five strands of the β-sheet are parallel, while the other two strands at the C-terminal end are antiparallel. Betw",PMC,pos,1,pos,4319,pos_PMC,0.99664307,1
27622521,"The C-terminal 18 Amino Acid Region of Dengue Virus NS5 Regulates its Subcellular Localization and Contains a Conserved Arginine Residue Essential for Infectious Virus Production. INTRODUCTION. Dengue is one of the most prevalent and important mosquito-borne viral disease and endemic in more than 100 tropical and subtropical countries. Nearly half of the world’s population is thought to be at risk of dengue infection and ~100 million symptomatic dengue cases are reported each year [1, 2]. Dengue infection in humans, caused by any one of the four distinct, but closely related Dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4), is mostly asymptomatic but those who manifest the disease exhibit a wide-spectrum of clinical symptoms, ranging from self-limiting dengue fever (DF) to life-threatening severe dengue characterized by vascular leakage, thrombocytopenia and bleeding [3]. The current treatment for dengue infection is mainly supportive. A tetravalent vaccine that is partially effective has been licensed in Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines. There are no antiviral drugs that can be used to prevent or treat dengue infection. Classical vector control strategies remain the cornerstone in preventing transmission, and molecular vector control approaches are gaining prominence [4]. The DENV single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome (~11kb) contains a single open reading frame that is flanked by 5’- and 3’-untranslated regions. The open reading frame is translated into an ~3,300 amino acid residue polyprotein precursor that is cleaved by host and viral proteases into three structural (C, prM and E) and seven nonstructural (NS; NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) proteins [5]. Among the NS proteins, NS5 is the largest (103 kDa, 900 amino acids) and the most conserved with a sequence identity of around 70% among the four serotypes [5, 6]. It contains methyltransferase (MTase) [7–9] and putative guanylyltransferase activities [10] at its N-terminal region, and the C-terminal region carries out RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity [11–13]. In infected cells, NS5 works in concert with NS3 to participate in type 1 cap formation [14] and viral RNA replication [15–18]. In addition to its enzymatic activities, DENV NS5 has been shown to modulate the host immune response and to induce the expression and secretion of DHF-associated immunomediators, IL-6 and IL-8 [19, 20]. More specifically, the N-terminal region of DENV2 NS5 can bind to human STAT2 [21], and promote UBR4-mediated STAT2 degradation that results in the inhibition of type I interferon signalling [21–24]. NS3 N570 and NS5 K330 are key residues involved in the interaction between NS3 and NS5 that act cooperatively to replicate the viral RNA within discrete replication complexes (RCs) [15, 25] but the mechanistic details such as the order in which the various processes occur during the early stages in viral RNA replication remains unknown. The introduction of K330A mutation into a DENV2 infectious clone does not yield any viable virus while the N570A mutation, although severely attenuated (5% of WT level), is able to accumulate negative-strand RNA at the early stages of viral RNA replication. However, because of the impaired interaction with NS5, its positive-strand RNA synthesis function is muted [17, 26]. Even though NS5 from the four serotypes of DENV are highly similar in structure and function it has been shown to be transported into the nucleus utilising the host nuclear transport machinery composed of importin-alpha and beta-1 to varying degrees [27, 28]. The phenotypic differences in subcellular localization can be ascribed to adaptive changes acquired during virus evolution but its essentiality and role in pathogenesis remains contentious. The importin-alpha recognition of basic-residue-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS) on NS5 facilitates its passage across the nuclear pore complex [27–29]. Previous NS5 localization studies have suggested that the a/bNLS (residues 369–389) [29, 30] and bNLS (residues 320–368) [31] reside within an interdomain linker region spanning residues 320–405 until the atomic resolution structure of DENV RdRp and recent functional studies [32] revealed that these residues map within the palm and thumb subdomains raising the possibility that they are not accessible for interaction with the importin machinery of the host cell. Using an in-house generated NS5 antibody [33], DENV1-4 NS5 was shown to differentially localize in infected cells. In particular, DENV1 NS5 is predominantly cytoplasmic while DENV2, 3 and 4 NS5 appear in the nucleus of infected cells [28]. In order to explore the causes underlying these distinct phenotypes from a structural and functional perspective, we hypothesized that a sequence within DENV1 NS5 plays a dominant role in influencing the function of a/bNLS. We performed extensive gene swapping between DENV1 and 2 full-length NS5 proteins to search for the signal sequence. We unexpectedly discovered a C-terminal monopartite NLS in DENV2 NS5 that resides within residues 883–900. This region of NS5 is very flexible and was not observed in our previous crystal structures of DENV NS5 [11, 13, 34] or JEV NS5 [35] but appears to play a role in NS5 oligomerization in a more recently published structure [36]. In this work, structural, biochemical, computational and reverse genetics data provide a compelling picture that the C-terminal region of DENV NS5 alone is sufficient to determine the localization differences between DENV serotypes. Our data also suggest that the C-terminal region may carry out an evolutionarily conserved function that is essential for flavivirus replication and pathogenesis. The implications of this discovery on DENV pathogenesis are discussed. RESULTS. THE C-TERMINAL 18 RESIDUES (CTER18) OF DENV NS5 CONFER ITS NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC SHUTTLING ABILITY. To assess the NS5 subcellular localization of DENV1-4, infected Huh-7 cells were examined and quantified using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) image analysis (Fig 1A, >90% infectivity).

27690308,"The Cac1 subunit of histone chaperone CAF-1 organizes CAF-1-H3/H4 architecture and tetramerizes histones. INTRODUCTION. Eukaryotic DNA is incorporated into chromatin structure via nucleosomes, which are units of ~146 DNA base pairs surrounding an octamer of histone proteins (Kornberg, 1974). The assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes is critical during DNA replication, as duplication of the genome requires concerted duplication of the resident histones. To facilitate this stepwise process (Smith and Stillman, 1991), eukaryotes employ histone chaperones, proteins that associate tightly with histones prior to histone deposition on DNA (reviewed in [Ransom et al., 2010; Das et al., 2010; Burgess and Zhang, 2013; Gurard-Levin et al., 2014]). The CAF-1 (Chromatin Assembly Factor (1) histone chaperone is intimately engaged in replication-dependent nucleosome assembly of nascent (Verreault et al., 1996; Smith and Stillman, 1989; Tyler et al., 2001) and parental histones H3/H4, by way of recruitment to the replication fork through PCNA (Proliferating cell nuclear antigen) (Shibahara and Stillman, 1999; Krawitz et al., 2002; Moggs et al., 2000; Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2009). At the fork, parental H3/H4 histones are inherited in a conservative manner, in which intact (H3/H4)2 tetramers are partitioned onto the replicated daughter strands (Prior et al., 1980; Xu et al., 2010). This model predicts CAF-1 will associate with (H3/H4)2 tetramers, rather than a single H3/H4 dimer. Multiple biophysical studies confirm that the monomeric form of CAF-1 tetramerizes H3/H4 (Winkler et al., 2012b; Liu et al., 2012). Other monomeric chaperones such as Asf1 bind one H3/H4 dimer (English et al., 2005, 2006), whereas those that accommodate (H3/H4)2 tetramers – including Nap1, Vps75, Mcm2 and Rtt106 – form homodimers themselves (Bowman et al., 2011; Su et al., 2012; Hammond et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2015; Richet et al., 2015). Together, the evidence suggests that CAF-1 induces a unique mechanism of H3/H4 oligomerization. The budding yeast CAF-1 complex consists of subunits Cac1, Cac2, and Cac3 (Figure 1A), which differ in their ability to bind H3/H4. GST-tagged Cac1, but not the other subunits, can co-immunoprecipitate endogenous human histones when expressed in HeLa cells (Li et al., 2008). A single lysine to arginine substitution on H3 residue 56 abolished Cac1 binding, implicating the first alpha helix (αN) in this interaction. Biophysical studies with the other subunits show that the H. sapiens and D. melanogaster homologs of Cac3 can bind H3/H4 with varying affinities (Song et al., 2008; Murzina et al., 2008; Nowak et al., 2011; Schmitges et al., 2011). However, dissociation constants for Cac1 and Cac2 binding to H3/H4 have not been reported, and neither have the subunit interactions required to induce the 1:2 chaperone:histone dimer stoichiometry. The architecture of the CAF-1 and CAF-1-H3/H4 complexes is not known in detail. Some biochemical evidence points to specific interactions between Cac1 and Cac2, and between Cac1 and Cac3. Substitution of Cac1 leucine 276 to proline blocks Cac3 binding (Krawitz et al., 2002), and GST-tagged Cac1 residues 215–429 are sufficient to bind Cac3 in vitro. In addition, the last one-third of the Cac1 human homolog, p150, is sufficient to bind Cac2 (Kaufman et al., 1995). Whether these interactions are critical for H3/H4 binding and oligomerization is also unknown. In this study, we investigate the CAF-1 and CAF-1-H3/H4 complexes using biophysical, structural, and functional validation approaches to gain insight into the mechanism of CAF-1 subunit interactions that promote H3/H4 tetramerization. The data indicate that Cac1 is the major subunit required and is sufficient for binding and tetramerizing H3/H4. Mass spectrometric analyses using both hydrogen/deuterium exchange and chemical cross-linking reveal H3/H4-induced conformational changes, as well as extensive cross-links between the C-terminus of Cac1 with H3 and H4. Although structural and biophysical analyses reveal a homo-dimerization motif at the Cac1 C-terminus, this is not sufficient for H3/H4 tetramerization. Rather, the Cac1 glutamate/aspartate (ED) domain is also required to tetramerize H3/H4 in vitro. These results support an architectural model for the replication-coupled CAF-1-H3/H4 complex, in which Cac1 scaffolds all protein-protein interactions and is predominantly involved in H3/H4 tetramerization. RESULTS. THE CAC1 SUBUNIT BINDS TO H3/H4 AND IS SUFFICIENT TO ASSEMBLE (H3/H4)2 TETRAMERS. To measure the contribution of each individual CAF-1 subunit in histone binding, the individual subunits were purified for use in fluorescence anisotropy experiments with pyrene-labeled H3/H4 (H3/H4(Py)) (Figure 1A,B, Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Each subunit was titrated independently into a fixed concentration of H3/H4(Py), inducing a concentration-dependent increase in pyrene fluorescence anisotropy that enabled binding constants to be measured (Table 1). Consistent with prior experiments, CAF-1 binds to H3/H4(Py) with low nanomolar affinity (KDapp = 5.3 nM) (Winkler et al., 2012b; Liu et al., 2012). Although all CAF-1 subunits increased the anisotropy of H3/H4(Py) at high (1 µM) concentrations, only Cac1 achieved saturable binding with sub-micromolar affinity for H3/H4 (KDapp = 97 nM). Cac2 and Cac3 titrations, on the other hand, did not reach saturation and displayed weak affinity for H3/H4. These results suggest that Cac1 contributes substantially to H3/H4 binding, and the other subunits provide accessory interactions to promote a high-affinity CAF-1-H3/H4 complex. Recent reports showed that CAF-1 not only binds to H3/H4, but arranges the histones into a nucleosomal (H3/H4)2 tetramer (Winkler et al., 2012b; Liu et al., 2012). Since all CAF-1 subunits bind H3/H4, albeit very weakly for Cac2 and Cac3, potentially one or more of these subunits in combination might be required to form tetrasomes ((H3/H4)2 tetramer bound to DNA). To test this possibility, we utilized an EMSA capable of resolving different stoichiometric",PMC,pos,1,pos,4340,pos_PMC,0.99469805,1
27791060,"Caulobacter PopZ forms an intrinsically disordered hub in organizing bacterial cell poles. Despite their relative simplicity, bacteria have complex anatomy at the subcellular level. At the cell poles of Caulobacter crescentus, a 177-amino acid (aa) protein called PopZ self-assembles into 3D polymeric superstructures. Remarkably, we find that this assemblage interacts directly with at least eight different proteins, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and chromosome segregation. The binding determinants within PopZ include 24 aa at the N terminus, a 32-aa region near the C-terminal homo-oligomeric assembly domain, and portions of an intervening linker region. Together, the N-terminal 133 aa of PopZ are sufficient for interacting with all binding partners, even in the absence of homo-oligomeric assembly. Structural analysis of this region revealed that it is intrinsically disordered, similar to p53 and other hub proteins that organize complex signaling networks in eukaryotic cells. Through live-cell photobleaching, we find rapid binding kinetics between PopZ and its partners, suggesting many pole-localized proteins become concentrated at cell poles through rapid cycles of binding and unbinding within the PopZ scaffold. We conclude that some bacteria, similar to their eukaryotic counterparts, use intrinsically disordered hub proteins for network assembly and subcellular organization.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4366,pos_MEDLINE,0.997981,1
27798771,"NMR assignments for the insertion domain of bacteriophage Sf6 coat protein. BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT. A recent bioinformatics analysis of more than 150 P22-like phages, showed that these cluster into three branches based on coat protein sequence identity: P22, CUS-3 and Sf6-like (Casjens and Grose 2016). The Sf6 phage infects the human pathogen Shigella flexneri and is suggested to increase the pathogenicity of the bacterium (Parent et al. 2014). The Sf6 coat protein has low sequence identity (<20 %) to the P22 and CUS-3 coat proteins but nevertheless adopts an HK97 folding motif, and contains a distinct genetically inserted I-domain (Parent et al. 2014, Rizzo et al. 2014). To date the only structurally characterized I-domain is that of the P22 phage, which has a 6-stranded β-barrel fold, a smaller accessory subdomain consisting of three β-strands, and a one and a half-turn α-helix (Rizzo et al. 2014). The P22 I-domain plays critical roles in capsid assembly, stability, viability, and size determination (Rizzo et al. 2014, D’Lima and Teschke 2015). Cryo-electron reconstructions show that the Sf6, P22, and CUS-3 I-domains protrude from the surfaces of T = 7 icosahedral particles (Parent et al. 2014). Interestingly, the morphology of the protrusions in Sf6 are different than in P22 and CUS-3, prompting us to examine if these changes in cryoEM data are due to differences in the Sf6 I-domain structure (Parent et al. 2014). Here we present NMR assignments for the Sf6 I-domain to complement those previously reported for the I-domains of P22 (Rizzo et al. 2014) and CUS-3 (Tripler et al. 2015). METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS. EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. The gene encoding the Sf6 I-domain, corresponding to amino acids 222–345 of the coat protein, was cloned into a pET21a plasmid (Novagen, Madison, WI). The presence of the cloned sequence was confirmed with DNA sequencing through Genewiz (South Plainfield, New Jersey). The vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells for protein expression. To make isotopically enriched samples for NMR, cells were grown at 37 °C in minimal medium supplemented with 3 g/L of 13C D-glucose and/or 1 g/L 15NH4Cl. Samples labeled with 2H, 13C, and 15N were obtained similarly, except that cells were grown in 99.8 % D2O at 30 °C, and 3 g/L 2H, 13C D-glucose was used as the carbon source. Protein expression was induced with a final concentration of 1 mM IPTG at mid-log phase, and cells were grown for a further 16 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3300g using a Sorvall SH-3000 swinging bucket rotor and resuspended in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.6, containing a 1:100 dilution of Sigma P8849 protease inhibitor, 0.1 % triton, 200 μg/mL lysozyme, 5.8 mM MgSO4, 0.58 mM CaCl2, and 115 μg/mL deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease. Cells were lysed using a Misonix sonicator operating at an amplitude of 37, with 15 s pulse and 30 s rest times for a total process time of three minutes. Following sonication, cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 38,621g using a F18-12 × 50 rotor. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 162,635g for 90 min in a Sorvall T-865 rotor to remove cell membranes. The supernatant was then run through a TALON metal affinity column (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain view, CA) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min for I-domain purification via an engineered C-terminal His6-tag. Fractions containing the Sf6 I-domain were visualized using 15 % SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. The fractions were pooled, followed by precipitation of the protein with 0.4 g/mL of ammonium sulfate for 30 min. The precipitated protein was sedimented by centrifugation at 38,621g using a F18-12 × 50 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 and dialyzed three times against the same buffer, followed by concentration using an Amicon Ultra 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Final sample concentrations were 2.1 mM for 13C/15N-labeled protein and 1.5 mM for 15N labeled protein. In addition to the I-domain of the Sf6 coat protein (amino acids 222–345), our construct contains the C-terminal 8-residue extension LEHHHHHH, an artifact of the affinity tag used for purification. NMR SPECTROSCOPY. Experiments from the Varian Protein Pack were collected on 600 and 800 MHz NMR spectrometers operating with cryogenic probes. Backbone assignments were made using 3D1H-15N-HSQC, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HN(CA)CO, and HNCO experiments (Cavanagh et al. 2006). Aliphatic side-chain assignments were made with 3DHCCH-TOCSY, CCH-TOCSY, HBHA(CO)NH, and 15N-TOCSY-HSQC experiments (Cavanagh et al. 2006). To assign aromatic side-chain protons, we collected additional 2D NOESY, DQF-COSY, and TOCSY spectra. Data were processed with the programs FELIX-NMR (San Diego, CA) and NMRpipe. The data were analyzed with CcpN (Vranken et al. 2005) using the platform NMRbox (http://nmrbox.org/). ASSIGNMENTS AND DATA DEPOSITION. Based on the quality reports from CcpN Analysis (Vranken et al. 2005), backbone chemical shift assignments were completed to greater than 98 % (Fig. 1). Residues P290 and I291 could not be assigned. Side-chain assignment coverage was 82 % for carbons, 92 % for hydrogens, and 89 % for nitrogens. Chemical shifts are deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu) under accession number 26844. Information on the secondary structure and dynamics of the three I-domains from phages Sf6, CUS-3, and P22 is summarized in Fig. 2. The three I-domains show similar secondary structure elements and we have confirmed that the Sf6 I-domain adopts a 6-stranded β-barrel core fold, like that of P22, based on hydrogen-bonding patterns identified from long-range HNCO data (Cordier and Grzesiek 1999). An important difference for Sf6, is that the D-loop (residues V239 to N254) found in the P22 and CUS-3 I-domains is absent in the Sf6 I-domain. This D-loop forms critical interactions between coat proteins to form proper capsid structures in P22 (D’Lima and Teschke 2015). Its absence in th",PMC,pos,1,pos,4368,pos_PMC,0.9966299,1

RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is a highly processive enzyme that transcribes ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and regulates growth of eukaryotic cells. Crystal structures of free Pol I from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed dimers of the enzyme stabilized by a 'connector' element and an expanded cleft containing the active centre in an inactive conformation. The central bridge helix was unfolded and a Pol-I-specific 'expander' element occupied the DNA-template-binding site. The structure of Pol I in its active transcribing conformation has yet to be determined, whereas structures of Pol II and Pol III have been solved with bound DNA template and RNA transcript. Here we report structures of active transcribing Pol I from yeast solved by two different cryo-electron microscopy approaches. A single-particle structure at 3.8 Å resolution reveals a contracted active centre cleft with bound DNA and RNA, and a narrowed pore beneath the active site that no longer holds the RNA-cleavage-stimulating domain of subunit A12.2. A structure at 29 Å resolution that was determined from cryo-electron tomograms of Pol I enzymes transcribing cellular rDNA confirms contraction of the cleft and reveals that incoming and exiting rDNA enclose an angle of around 150°.

27844185,"A J-modulated protonless NMR experiment characterizes the conformational ensemble of the intrinsically disordered protein WIP. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are multi-conformational polypeptides that lack a single stable three-dimensional structure. It has become increasingly clear that the versatile IDPs play key roles in a multitude of biological processes, and, given their flexible nature, NMR is a leading method to investigate IDP behavior on the molecular level. Here we present an IDP-tailored J-modulated experiment designed to monitor changes in the conformational ensemble characteristic of IDPs by accurately measuring backbone one- and two-bond J(15N,13Cα) couplings. This concept was realized using a unidirectional (H)NCO 13C-detected experiment suitable for poor spectral dispersion and optimized for maximum coverage of amino acid types. To demonstrate the utility of this approach we applied it to the disordered actin-binding N-terminal domain of WASp interacting protein (WIP), a ubiquitous key modulator of cytoskeletal changes in a range of biological systems. One- and two-bond J(15N,13Cα) couplings were acquired for WIP residues 2-65 at various temperatures, and in denaturing and crowding environments. Under native conditions fitted J-couplings identified in the WIP conformational ensemble a propensity for extended conformation at residues 16-23 and 45-60, and a helical tendency at residues 28-42. These findings are consistent with a previous study of the based upon chemical shift and RDC data and confirm that the WIP2-65 conformational ensemble is biased towards the structure assumed by this fragment in its actin-bound form. The effects of environmental changes upon this ensemble were readily apparent in the J-coupling data, which reflected a significant decrease in structural propensity at higher temperatures, in the presence of 8 M urea, and under the influence of a bacterial cell lysate. The latter suggests that crowding can cause protein unfolding through protein-protein interactions that stabilize the unfolded state. We conclude that J-couplings are a useful measureable in characterizing structural ensembles in IDPs, and that the proposed experiment provides a practical method for accurately performing such measurements, once again emphasizing the power of NMR in studying IDP behavior.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4383,pos_MEDLINE,0.99740905,1
27845691,"Non-invasive evaluation of placental blood flow: lessons from animal models. In human obstetrics, placental vascularisation impairment is frequent as well as linked to severe pathological events (preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction), and there is a need for reliable methods allowing non-invasive evaluation of placental blood flow. Uteroplacental vascularisation is complex, and animal models are essential for the technical development and safety assessment of these imaging tools for human clinical use; however, these techniques can also be applied in the veterinary context. This paper reviews how ultrasound-based imaging methods such as 2D and 3D Doppler can provide valuable insight for the exploration of placental blood flow both in humans and animals and how new approaches such as the use of ultrasound contrast agents or ultrafast Doppler may allow to discriminate between maternal (non-pulsatile) and foetal (pulsatile) blood flow in the placenta.

NOTCH1 is one of the four mammalian Notch receptors, which is involved in the Notch signaling pathway. Specifically, NOTCH1 promotes the proliferation of myogenic precursor cells, and the NICD domain of NOTCH1 can impair regeneration of skeletal muscles. However, similar research on the bovine NOTCH1 gene is lacking. In this study, we detected the polymorphisms of the bovine NOTCH1 gene in a total of 448 individuals from Chinese Qinchuan cattle with DNA pooling, forced PCR-RFLP, and DNA sequencing methods. Five novel SNPs were identified within the NICD domain, and eight haplotypes comprising combinations of these five SNPs were studied as well. The association analysis of SNPs' effects with growth traits revealed that g.A48250G was significantly associated with body height, body weight, and height at hip cross, and that g.A49239C only showed significant associations with body height.

27941862,"Cryo-EM structures of human RAD51 recombinase filaments during catalysis of DNA-strand exchange. INTRODUCTION. Homologous recombination (HR) plays essential roles in genetic integrity maintenance by eliminating DNA lesions such as double stranded breaks, inter-strand crosslinks, and collapsed replication forks. HR is also indispensable for meiosis wherein it helps ensure the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes, and it also contributes to the generation of genetic diversity. HR is a highly intricate and precisely regulated process involving a large number of proteins and complexes. Among these HR factors are a family of conserved recombinases that catalyze ATP-dependent pairing and strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules. The most studied recombinases are RecA in bactera, RadA in archaea, and Rad51 in eukaryotic cells. Upon ATP binding, recombinase protomers assemble into a right-handed helical filament on ssDNA (the invading strand) called the presynaptic filament. The presynaptic complex engages and samples duplex DNA to search for a homologous region in the latter. Successful homology search is followed by limited base pairing between the invading strand and the complementary strand in the dsDNA. This HR stage has been termed as synaptic complex formation. Then, more extensive DNA strand exchange occurs, and the newly formed DNA joint is bound by the recombinase filament in the post-synaptic complex. This complex is subsequently resolved with the disassembly of the recombinase filament and the recruitment of a DNA polymerase to extend the 3′ end of the invading DNA strand. The HR reaction mediated by the conserved recombinases has been studied using biochemical, biophysical and structural approaches. X-ray crystal structures of E. coli RecA, yeast Rad51, archaea RadA in their DNA-free state have been solved, which reveal homologous core domains responsible for ATP binding and protomer-protomer interactions. Electron microscopy at low resolution has also been applied to examine the structures of RecA and Rad51 in complex with ssDNA or dsDNA at different nucleotide state. An atomic resolution view of RecA in complex with ssDNA and/or dsDNA has been provided by X-ray crystallography. These structures illustrate an extended conformation of the invading DNA along the central axis of the RecA filament assembly and pairing with the complementary strand in triplet clusters. Whether or not these attributes of the presynaptic and post-synaptic complexes of RecA are shared by the eukaryotic recombinases has not been addressed. Moreover, owing to a lack of structural information of intermediate states, it remains unknown how the DNA strands in the homologous dsDNA become separated in the synaptic phase of the DNA strand exchange reaction. In this study, we have carried out cryo-EM analyses of human RAD51 in different states of the DNA strand exchange process. These endeavors have enabled us to determine the structures of presynaptic and post-synaptic complexes of RAD51 at near atomic resolution. Furthermore, we have captured an intermediate state in the strand exchange process that allows us to visualize strand separation of the incoming duplex partner within the synaptic complex. RESULTS. CRYO-EM STRUCTURES OF PRESYNAPTIC COMPLEX AND POST-SYNAPTIC COMPLEX. Purified human RAD51 protein was incubated with ssDNA in the presence of AMP-PNP to form the presynaptic filament (Online Methods, Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. S1). As we showed previously, the ability of the presynaptic filament to conduct DNA strand exchange with a homologous duplex DNA partner is significantly enhanced by the recombinase co-factor Hop2-Mnd1 complex (Fig. S1). The presynaptic filament and post-synaptic complex generated with the presence of Hop2-Mnd1 adopt a well-ordered helical structure under conditions of cryo-EM, allowing us to use the IHRSR (Iterative Helical Real Space Reconstruction) algorithm for solving their 3D structures at 4.4 Å and 4.5 Å resolution, respectively (Online Methods, Table 1, Fig. 1, Fig. S2, Video S1 and S2). Both structures possess similar helical parameters of rise 15.8 Å and twist 56.77°, corresponding to a helical assembly of 6.3 RAD51 protomers per turn with about 100 Å pitch. While the overall structures of the presynaptic and post-synaptic complexes are similar, a distinct difference occurs along the helical axis of these complexes, where the latter harbors extra density (Fig. 1a and 1c). Our reconstruction of the RAD51 presynaptic complex share a very similar overall shape of the protomer with the 3D reconstruction of HsRAD51 presynaptic complex reported in a latest research although the helical symmetry deviates slightly between the two. We have built atomic models of the presynaptic and post-synaptic complexes from high resolution EM maps, which show key features of secondary structural elements and major side chains of the most rigid part in RAD51 as well as the DNA backbone and bases (Table 1, Fig. 1b,1d and Fig. S3). The atomic models include DNA and most of the residues of RAD51 except for the N-terminal 1-21 residues and a few residues in flexible loop regions. It is worth noting that the density of DNA in both the presynaptic and post-synaptic complex reconstructions appear as triplet clusters within asymmetric units of the helical RAD51 assembly. The current resolution does not allow us to resolve individual bases within the DNA density but the density of DNA is sufficiently clear to reveal the bound bases and base pairs arranged in distinct triplets (Fig. S3). We noticed that the density corresponding to the complementary strand was relatively weaker than that of the invading strand in the post-synaptic complex reconstruction, possibly due to the partial completion of the strand-exchange reaction. Our results thus provide evidence for a conserved mechanism of DNA engagement by RecA and RAD51. Although we added Hop2-Mnd1 complex, with ∼12% of the RAD51, in our system to enhance the strand-exchange reaction, we didn't detect any prominent density corresponding",PMC,pos,1,pos,4398,pos_PMC,0.9959771,1
27973583,"Structure and Mechanism of Staphylococcus aureus TarS, the Wall Teichoic Acid β-glycosyltransferase Involved in Methicillin Resistance. INTRODUCTION. Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a leading cause of life-threatening nosocomial infections including pneumonia, bacteremia, and surgical wound infections [1]. Due to wide-spread β-lactam antibiotic resistance, the first-line treatment for serious MRSA infections has been vancomycin, a glycopeptide class antibiotic. However rising resistance to vancomycin has forced the use of undesirable alternatives with high cost and dose limitations due to adverse events [2]. Both β-lactam and glycopeptide antibiotics disrupt peptidoglycan cross-linking that eventually weakens the integrity of the bacterial cell wall and leads to lysis. Due to the efficacy and safety profile of β-lactam antibiotics, re-sensitization of MRSA to these drugs is a promising option that entails understanding of complex resistance mechanisms. Resistance in MRSA mainly evolves from the expression of PBP2a, a β-lactam-insensitive penicillin-binding protein that can cross-link peptidoglycan in the presence of clinically relevant concentrations of nearly all β–lactam antibiotics (reviewed in [3]). Interestingly, recent reports have uncovered the role of wall teichoic acids and more specifically, their β-O-GlcNAc decorations, in mediating MRSA resistance to β-lactams [4,5], opening new avenues for drug discovery efforts aimed at re-sensitization. Teichoic acids are anionic glycopolymers that compose an astonishing 60% of the dry weight of the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria [6]. These polymers may either be attached to membranes in the form of lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) or transferred onto peptidoglycan as wall teichoic acids (WTAs). Collectively, TAs are implicated in diverse processes such as coping with environmental stress [7,8], interaction with receptors and biomaterials [9,10], induction of inflammation [11–13], phage binding [14,15], immune evasion [16], biofilm formation [17], resistance to lysozyme [18], and resistance to antimicrobial molecules [5,19–21]. This adaptability arises largely from D-alanylation and glycosylation of TA polyol hydroxyl groups, influencing the physical and interactive properties of the cell wall. In most S. aureus strains, WTAs consist of polyribitol phosphate (polyRboP) chains of 40–60 repeats that are attached to the peptidoglycan via a disaccharide linkage unit to C6 hydroxyls of occasional N-acetylmuramic acid residues [22]. The C4 hydroxyls of S. aureus WTAs are furthermore heavily substituted with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) via α- or β-O-linkages. The configuration of the glycosidic linkage varies according to strain, with some having exclusive α- or β-O-linked GlcNAc, and others displaying a mixture [23,24]. In S. aureus, WTA GlcNAcs serve as receptors for phage binding [15], have long been recognized as important antigens in the host-antibody response [25–27], and have more recently been implicated in biofilm formation [28]. Furthermore, the stereochemistry of GlcNAc glycosidic linkages appears to directly influence both the biology and pathogenicity of S. aureus and other Gram-positive bacteria on a strain-specific level. The enzymes responsible for S. aureus WTA GlcNAcylation are the α-glycosyltransferase TarM and the β-glycosyltransferase TarS. Both these enzymes reside in the cytoplasm and decorate nascent WTA chains before transport and attachment to the peptidoglycan sacculus. Of significance is the recent discovery that β-O-GlcNAcylation of S. aureus WTA is specifically responsible for methicillin resistance in MRSA, which may be due to the possible direct or indirect recruitment of the β-lactam insensitive PBP2a that mediates resistance[5,29]. Accordingly, the deletion of TarS has been shown to result in the re-sensitization of MRSA strains to β-lactam antibiotics [5]. TarS mediated WTA β-O-GlcNAcylation has also been implicated in the induction of anti-WTA IgG-mediated complement activation and opsonophagocytosis in clinically isolated S. aureus strains [30]. We have recently published the first structure of TarM and elucidated its catalytic mechanism [31]. In this report, we present the first structure of TarS in the presence of donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc, elucidate various features involved in catalysis, and describe a novel trimerization domain composed of tandem carbohydrate binding motifs. Due to the pivotal role of TarS in MRSA resistance, its structure is particularly valuable for rational drug design efforts in combination therapies aimed at MRSA re-sensitization. RESULTS. OVERALL STRUCTURE OF TARS. The structures presented here are of the TarS full-length protein (1–573), the TarS1-349 (1–349) construct consisting of the catalytic domain (1–319) and the linker (320–352), and the TarS217-573 (217–573) construct consisting of the catalytic domain C-terminal helical bundle (217–319), the linker and the trimerization domain (353–573) (S1 Fig). Refinement statistics of the final structural models are presented in Table 1. The full-length TarS crystals diffracted with strong anisotropy and a high resolution limit of 4 Å was applied. Due to the limited structural resolution of full-length TarS, efforts were made to obtain higher resolution structures of the individual protein domains. Limited (thermolysin) proteolysis of the purified full-length TarS protein resulted in crystals diffracting to ~ 2.3 Å resolution, with SAD phasing using an iodide derivative revealing cleavage of the N-terminal region of the catalytic domain (1–216) and the structure of the TarS217-573 as described (Fig 1). TarS1-349, described above, was isolated by designing a structure-guided truncation mutant (based on the TarS217-573 structure) that resulted in a structure at 2.3 Å resolution with intact UDP-GlcNAc bound in the active site (Fig 2A). The intact (rather than hydrolyzed) UDP-GlcNAc in the active site was achieved by soaking crystals in increased concentrations of substrate (50 mM) before freezing.

27986592,"The FA Core Complex Contains a Homo-dimeric Catalytic Module for the Symmetric Mono-ubiquitination of FANCI-FANCD2. SUMMARY. Activation of the main DNA interstrand crosslink repair pathway in higher eukaryotes requires mono-ubiquitination of FANCI and FANCD2 by FANCL, the E3 ligase subunit of the Fanconi anemia core complex. FANCI and FANCD2 form a stable complex; however, the molecular basis of their ubiquitination is ill defined. FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination by FANCL is stimulated by the presence of the FANCB and FAAP100 core complex components, through an unknown mechanism. How FANCI mono-ubiquitination is achieved remains unclear. Here, we use structural electron microscopy, combined with crosslink-coupled mass spectrometry, to find that FANCB, FANCL, and FAAP100 form a dimer of trimers, containing two FANCL molecules that are ideally poised to target both FANCI and FANCD2 for mono-ubiquitination. The FANCC-FANCE-FANCF subunits bridge between FANCB-FANCL-FAAP100 and the FANCI-FANCD2 substrate. A transient interaction with FANCC-FANCE-FANCF alters the FANCI-FANCD2 configuration, stabilizing the dimerization interface. Our data provide a model to explain how equivalent mono-ubiquitination of FANCI and FANCD2 occurs. INTRODUCTION. Interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are toxic DNA lesions that prevent the separation of the two filaments in the DNA double helix, impairing DNA replication and transcription. The Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway is the major interstrand crosslink repair process in higher eukaryotes (Knipscheer et al., 2009, Kottemann and Smogorzewska, 2013). Activation of this pathway depends on the specific mono-ubiquitination of the FANCI and FANCD2 proteins by the FA core complex (Ceccaldi et al., 2016, Garcia-Higuera et al., 2001, Sims et al., 2007, Smogorzewska et al., 2007, Timmers et al., 2001). Mutations in the FA genes cause a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to crosslinking agents, chromosomal instability, and cancer predisposition (Deans and West, 2011). Despite the enormous effort of several research groups, a mechanistic understanding of the activation of the FA ICL repair pathway is only starting to emerge (Walden and Deans, 2014). A key player in the recognition of ICLs is the FA anchor complex (consisting of the FANCM DNA translocase, FAAP24, and two histone-like factors named MHF1-2), which, in turn, recruits the FA core complex to the DNA damage site (Ciccia et al., 2007, Coulthard et al., 2013, Kim et al., 2008, Yan et al., 2010). The core complex is composed of three distinct protein assemblies with non-redundant functions: FANCB-FANCL-FAAP100 (hereinafter called BL100), FANCC-FANCE-FANCF (CEF), and FANCA-FANCG-FAAP20 (AG20) (Huang et al., 2014, Rajendra et al., 2014). While the AG20 and CEF play loosely defined ancillary roles (Wang and Smogorzewska, 2015), the BL100 complex is a three-member ubiquitin ligase, with FANCL as the minimal unit required for ubiquitination (Huang et al., 2014, Meetei et al., 2003, Rajendra et al., 2014). FANCL is an E3 ligase containing a RING domain that is essential for the interaction with the E2 enzyme, UBE2T/FANCT, and for the mono-ubiquitination of the FANCI and FANCD2 molecular targets (Cole et al., 2010, Hodson et al., 2011, Hodson et al., 2014, Machida et al., 2006). Although FANCL is active in isolation, its catalytic function is greatly stimulated by the interaction with FANCB and FAAP100 (Huang et al., 2014, Rajendra et al., 2014). Whether binding of these two factors causes an activating conformational switch in the FANCL catalytic center, or whether FANCB and FAAP100 play an architectural role important for mono-ubiquitination, is unknown. Multiple other architectural aspects of the mono-ubiquitination of FANCI and FANCD2 likewise remain poorly understood. First, crystallographic studies on mouse proteins indicate that the FANCI-FANCD2 (ID2) hetero-dimer forms a pseudo-2-fold symmetric arrangement. However, the mono-ubiquitination sites map at the dimerization interface within the ID2 complex (Joo et al., 2011), suggesting that a reconfiguration of this interface is needed at some point during the mono-ubiquitination reaction to allow for access of the E3 ligase assembly. Second, whether a stable ID2 complex is recruited to the DNA damage site prior to mono-ubiquitination is unclear, although recent cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies on the unmodified human proteins support this notion (Liang et al., 2016). Remarkably the symmetric hetero-dimer captured by crystallography cannot be recognized in the electron microscopy (EM) structure, suggesting that the ID2 complex might visit different conformational states throughout the ubiquitination reaction. Finally, although both members of the ID2 dimer need to be mono-ubiquitinated for activation of the ICL repair pathway (Sims et al., 2007, Smogorzewska et al., 2007, Timmers et al., 2001), so far, biochemical reconstitution has mainly focused on the minimal ability of the BL100 E3 ligase to mono-ubiquitinate FANCD2, with little to no FANCI mono-ubiquitination observed (Rajendra et al.,2014). How equivalent mono-ubiquitination of both FANCI and FANCD2 is achieved and whether any of the ancillary proteins in the FA core complex are involved in this process remain unresolved questions. To address these issues, we have used EM, combined with crosslinking and mass spectrometry (XL/MS), to analyze the architecture of the BL100 complex and its substrate ID2, either in isolation or with other components of the FA core complex. We found that BL100 forms a symmetric dimer of trimers, inviting a molecular model for the equivalent ubiquitination of the dimeric ID2 assembly. The CEF component of the FA core complex binds to the two extremities in the BL100 dimer, probably acting as a molecular matchmaker that mediates the BL100 and ID2 interaction. We also uncovered an unexpected structural function for CEF, which stabilizes the dimerization interface of the ID2 complex. We postulate that this function might have a direct role in the efficient mono-ubiquitination of the ID",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,4404,far_neg_PMC,0.9972904,1
27986852,"Structure of a 30S pre-initiation complex stalled by GE81112 reveals structural parallels in bacterial and eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation pathways. INTRODUCTION. In bacteria, during the initiation phase of protein synthesis three initiation factors (IFs: IF1, IF2 and IF3), the messenger RNA (mRNA), and initiator tRNA (fMet–tRNA) assemble in a 30S pre-initiation complex (preIC) in which proper codon–anticodon base pairing has not yet taken place (1–3). The actual mRNA start codon recognition progresses through several checkpoints the first of which entails a first order conformational change of the 30S preIC that allows codon–anticodon base pairing in the P-site that produces a ‘locked’ 30S initiation complex (30SIC) provided that both composition and structure of the 30S preIC are canonical (2). The resulting 30SIC is structurally competent for joining the large ribosomal subunit (50S) to form the 70S ribosomal initiation complex (70SIC), a process in which IF1 and IF3 dissociate from the ribosome whereas IF2 remains ribosome-bound until it has delivered the acceptor end of fMet-tRNA in a position amenable for the formation of the first peptide bond (4,5). The transition from the ‘unlocked’ 30S preIC to the ‘locked’ 30SIC is antagonized by IF3 and IF1 if the former complex contains a non-canonical element (e.g. an initiation triplet other than AUG, GUG or UUG). In this case, IF3 remains more tightly bound to the 30S subunit and association with the 50S subunit is impaired (2,6). Recent data have shown that GE81112, a specific inhibitor of the initiation phase of protein synthesis (7), binds near the anticodon stem loop of fMet–tRNA and while allowing the formation of the 30S preIC it blocks the locking step that marks the transition to 30SIC; therefore, GE81112 represents a powerful tool to trap the 30S subunit stalled in a preIC state characterized by only partial P-site codon–anticodon base-pairing and tighter IF3 binding (8). These properties of GE81112 were exploited in this study to produce a 30S preIC in which IF1, IF2, IF3 and the fMet–tRNA can be visualized on the 30S subunit as to reveal for the first time the structural details of this early translation initiation intermediate. In fact, whereas bacterial complexes representative of the late steps of the initiation process, namely the 30SIC and 70SIC have been studied by cryo-EM (9–15), no structural information is so far available for the 30S preIC. MATERIALS AND METHODS. ASSEMBLY OF THE 30S IC. Escherichia coli ribosomes, ribosomal subunits and translational factors were prepared as previously described (16,17). Using purified components (Supplementary Figure S1), the 30SIC was assembled by incubating the 30S ribosomal subunits with GE81112 for 10 min at 37°C in Buffer IC (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.7), 7 mM MgCl2, and 60 mM NH4CH3CO2) prior to addition of the mRNA construct containing a model Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AAG UUA ACA GGU AUA CAU ACU AUG UUU ACG AUU ACU ACG AUC Sigma Genosys), fMet–tRNA, GTP and IF1, IF2, IF3, and continuing the incubation at 37°C for an additional 10 min. Throughout this incubation buffer conditions are kept constant and the final factor concentrations are 1 μM 30S, 20 μM GE81112, 4 μM mRNA, 2.8 μM fMet–tRNA, 50 μM GTP, 3.2 μM IF1, 1.6 μM IF2 and 3.2 μM IF3. ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. The 30SIC sample was vitrified using a Vitrobot (FEI) by diluting the reconstituted 30S IC in Buffer IC containing 20 μM GE81112, 4 μM mRNA, 2.8 μM fMet–tRNA and 50 μM GTP onto Quantifiol R2/2 grids. The samples were then imaged under low dose conditions at 74 183× magnification using a JEOL JEM 2200FS + Ultrascan 4K CCD camera (CIC bioGUNE; Bilbao) yielding a pixel size of 2.02 Å/pixel. SINGLE PARTICLE ANALYSIS AND STRUCTURE DETERMINATION. Contrast transfer function parameters were estimated using CTFFIND4 (18). Semi-automated particle selection was performed in RELION 1.4 yielding a total of 174 412 particles from which poorly aligning particles were removed using the 2D reference-free classification and 3D classification procedures also in the RELION software package (19,20). The remaining 74 848 particles were used to initiate a 3D refinement using a low-pass filtered (40 Å) empty 30S subunit as the starting model. The ensuing volume was subjected to 3D classification using local searches of 5° and the resulting three classes were then refined and post-processed within RELION 1.4 (Supplementary Figure S2) (19). The 30S IC-1 and 30S IC-2 volumes were interpreted using a combination of manual rigid body docking and automated multibody docking with the UCSF Chimera and SITUS software packages (21,22). Specifically, for IF1 the cryo-EM density did not have enough features for automated docking with SITUS to yield a consistent position so that for this factor we used the model observed in the 30S-IF1 crystal structure (23). The position of IF3 relative to the 30S subunit was kept constant in both models. Segmentation of the 30S IC-1 and 30S IC-2 volumes used the Segger plug-in for UCSF Chimera (24). The following structures deposited in the PDB were used as rigid body models: 4YBB, E. coli 30S head and body; 3JCN, E. coli IF2 and fMet–tRNA; 1HR0, T. thermophilus IF1; 2IFE, E. coli IF3CTD; 1TIF, Geobacillus stearothermophilus IF3NTD. When ligands were fitted as multiple independent bodies (i.e. domains G2-C1 and C2 of IF2, residues 1–72 and 73–76 of the tRNA) the conformation of the linking residues were minimized. All figures were prepared with UCSF Chimera (21). The 30S IC-1 and 30S IC-2 volumes and fitted models are deposited in the EMDB (EMD-3494 and EMD-3495) and PDB (5ME0 and 5ME1). RESULTS. OVERVIEW OF THE STRUCTURES. The stalled E. coli 30S preIC was assembled in vitro by incubating, in the presence of GE81112, purified 30S subunits, IFs, fMet–tRNA, GTP and an mRNA construct containing a model Shine-Dalgarno sequence (Supplementary Figure S1A; Materials and Methods) (6). The binding conditions (i.e. buffers and relative concentration of 30S ligands) were adapted from those established to follow the kinetics of initiation complex formation using variations of the FRET",PMC,pos,1,pos,4405,pos_PMC,0.9952356,1
28076346,"Cryo-EM structure of a human spliceosome activated for step 2 of splicing. Spliceosome rearrangements facilitated by RNA helicase PRP16 before catalytic step two of splicing are poorly understood. Here we report a 3D cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human spliceosomal C complex stalled directly after PRP16 action (C*). The architecture of the catalytic U2-U6 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) core of the human C* spliceosome is very similar to that of the yeast pre-Prp16 C complex. However, in C* the branched intron region is separated from the catalytic centre by approximately 20 Å, and its position close to the U6 small nuclear RNA ACAGA box is stabilized by interactions with the PRP8 RNase H-like and PRP17 WD40 domains. RNA helicase PRP22 is located about 100 Å from the catalytic centre, suggesting that it destabilizes the spliced mRNA after step two from a distance.

28085263,"Structure and Dynamics of the Huntingtin Exon-1 N-Terminus: A Solution NMR Perspective. Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by misfolding and aggregation of an expanded polyglutamine tract (polyQ). Huntington's Disease, caused by expansion of the polyQ tract in exon 1 of the Huntingtin protein (Htt), is associated with aggregation and neuronal toxicity. Despite recent structural progress in understanding the structures of amyloid fibrils, little is known about the solution states of Htt in general, and about molecular details of their transition from soluble to aggregation-prone conformations in particular. This is an important question, given the increasing realization that toxicity may reside in soluble conformers. This study presents an approach that combines NMR with computational methods to elucidate the structural conformations of Htt Exon 1 in solution. Of particular focus was Htt's N17 domain sited N-terminal to the polyQ tract, which is key to enhancing aggregation and modulate Htt toxicity. Such in-depth structural study of Htt presents a number of unique challenges: the long homopolymeric polyQ tract contains nearly identical residues, exon 1 displays a high degree of conformational flexibility leading to a scaling of the NMR chemical shift dispersion, and a large portion of the backbone amide groups are solvent-exposed leading to fast hydrogen exchange and causing extensive line broadening. To deal with these problems, NMR assignment was achieved on a minimal Htt exon 1, comprising the N17 domain, a polyQ tract of 17 glutamines, and a short hexameric polyProline region that does not contribute to the spectrum. A pH titration method enhanced this polypeptide's solubility and, with the aid of ≤5D NMR, permitted the full assignment of N17 and the entire polyQ tract. Structural predictions were then derived using the experimental chemical shifts of the Htt peptide at low and neutral pH, together with various different computational approaches. All these methods concurred in indicating that low-pH protonation stabilizes a soluble conformation where a helical region of N17 propagates into the polyQ region, while at neutral pH both N17 and the polyQ become largely unstructured-thereby suggesting a mechanism for how N17 regulates Htt aggregation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4418,pos_MEDLINE,0.9976859,1
28112645,"Structure of the active form of human origin recognition complex and its ATPase motor module. INTRODUCTION. The first step in genome replication, the binding of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) at origins of DNA replication, triggers a series of highly coordinated steps leading to the assembly of pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs) in a process that involves CDC6 binding to ORC (Bell and Labib, 2016). ORC and CDC6 then function as an ATP-dependent assembler that first recruits a ring-shaped MCM2-7 hexamer with bound Cdt1 to DNA, and then loads a second MCM2-7 hexamer in a head-to-head orientation, whereby this double hexamer is topologically linked to double-stranded DNA (reviewed in [O'Donnell et al., 2013; Siddiqui et al., 2013; Bell and Labib, 2016]). These MCM2-7 double hexamers mark the location of potential origins of DNA replication that can be activated during S phase to replicate the genome. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the pre-RC includes the two head-to-head associated Mcm2-7 hexamers with each hexamer destined to become a part of the Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS (CMG) helicase at each replication fork during S phase (Abid Ali and Costa, 2016). Regulated assembly and disassembly of the pre-RC ensures that the genome replicates only once during each cell division cycle (O'Donnell et al., 2013; Siddiqui et al., 2013). In budding yeasts, ORC is a stable complex consisting of five AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) related subunits and another subunit, Orc6. Orc1, Orc4 and Orc5 are bona-fide members of a large class of AAA+ proteins that contain the characteristic Walker-A and Walker-B motifs, but the only active ATPase in S. cerevisiae ORC is the Orc1 subunit with its adjacent Orc4 subunit that contributes an activating arginine finger and other residues required for ORC function in vivo (Loo et al., 1995; Klemm et al., 1997; Bowers et al., 2004). Mutations in the Walker-A motif of S. cerevisiae Orc4 and Orc5 are not essential for cell proliferation (Loo et al., 1995). Moreover, Orc2 and Orc3 were predicted to contain an AAA+ fold, but these subunits do not have the residues that are important for ATP hydrolysis and thus are predicted to be ‘AAA+ like’ (Bell et al., 1993; Foss and Rine, 1993; Micklem et al., 1993). The yeast ORC binds to origin DNA throughout the cell division cycle, even during mitotic exit. During G1 phase, it recruits the Orc1-related initiator protein Cdc6, another AAA+ ATPase, to the origin DNA, creating an extended footprint over the entire origin (Diffley et al., 1994; Liang et al., 1995; Speck et al., 2005). In contrast, in human cells, ORC binding to chromosomes is dynamic, with the first step being the binding of ORC1 to mitotic chromosomes and the subsequent assembly of ORC onto chromatin during the next G1 phase (Okuno et al., 2001; Siddiqui and Stillman, 2007; Wu et al., 2014; Kara et al., 2015; Abid Ali and Costa, 2016). During entry into S phase, the human ORC1 subunit is degraded (reviewed in [DePamphilis 2003]). A detailed molecular understanding of the ORC-CDC6 ATPase loading machine and its motor function is essential to decipher how it works to initiate replication. Several low-resolution structures of ORC from Drosophila melanogaster (Clarey et al., 2006; Bleichert et al., 2013) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Speck et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2012) are available, but they show different architectures. Recently, a high-resolution crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster ORC (DmORC) was reported (Bleichert et al., 2015). This structure contains truncated versions of ORC1, ORC2, and ORC3, full-length ORC4 and ORC5, and a small fragment of ORC6. The overall shape of the crystal structure matches the shape observed in the low-resolution EM structures of this complex. The DmORC was captured in a state that is inactive for ATP hydrolysis by ORC1, the most critical ATPase subunit. This is because the interface between ORC1 and ORC4 and thus the ATP-binding site is disrupted, even though one of the crystal forms reported bound nucleotide. This state of the complex would have to undergo a substantial conformational transition in order to become functionally active for ATP hydrolysis, as noted by the authors. Here, we report the structure of human ORC in a functionally active, ATP-hydrolysis ready state, providing insight into ATP-dependent protein loading as well as DNA and CDC6 binding. We also examine the effect of heretofore uncharacterized Meier-Gorlin Syndrome mutations on its molecular function. Meier-Gorlin Syndrome is a primordial dwarfism, microcephalic disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding pre-replicative complex proteins, including ORC1, ORC4, ORC6 and CDC6 (Bicknell et al., 2011a, 2011b; Guernsey et al., 2011; de Munnik et al., 2012b). To facilitate structural studies of HsORC, we separated the particle into two lobes, one consisting of an N-terminally truncated ORC1, full-length ORC4 and a C-terminally truncated ORC5 (see Materials and methods, Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The other lobe consists of N-terminally truncated ORC2 and full-length ORC3. Both subcomplexes yielded crystals, with the ORC1/4/5 motor module diffracting well to 3.4 Å, and the ORC2/3 subcomplex to 6 Å (Tables 1 and 2). Since ORC1/4/5 is comprised of the active ATPase subunits, the inclusion of ATP was critical to maintain its integrity during purification and crystallization. We hereafter refer to the ORC1/4/5 subcomplex as the HsORC motor module. In contrast, HsORC2/3 is composed of AAA+-like subunits, but with no predicted ATPase activity. The two subcomplexes were modeled into a 20 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) 3D-reconstruction map to obtain a structural model for the HsORC1-5 complex. The structure of HsORC reveals a remarkable similarity between two very different ATPases: the replication initiator ORC-CDC6 ATPase and the replication fork DNA polymerase clamp loader (Kelch et al., 2011). Both ATPases function at different times during genome replication but load ring-shaped proteins onto double-stranded DNA so that",PMC,pos,1,pos,4428,pos_PMC,0.9974039,1

28244370,"Molecular architecture of the 90S small subunit pre-ribosome. INTRODUCTION. The small 40S and large 60S subunit (SSU and LSU) of eukaryotic ribosomes are assembled from four ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and 79 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) in a highly complicated and dynamic process (Henras et al., 2008; Kressler et al., 2010; Woolford and Baserga, 2013). Numerous assembly factors (AFs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) associate with the two subunits to assist their maturation. Mutations in the genes of r-proteins and AFs have been found to cause various diseases (Freed et al., 2010). The 18S rRNA in the SSU and the 5.8S and 25S rRNA in the LSU are co-transcribed into a long 35S precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) in the nucleolus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc). The pre-rRNA also encodes four spacer sequences that need to be removed during processing. The 5' region of pre-rRNA that consists of the 5' external transcribed spacer (5' ETS), 18S rRNA and the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) is co-transcriptionally packed into a terminal ball of ~40 nm in size (Osheim et al., 2004). These particles represent the earliest assembly intermediates of 40S and are known as the 90S pre-ribosome or the SSU processome (Trapman et al., 1975; Dragon et al., 2002; Grandi et al., 2002; Phipps et al., 2011). Within 90S, the pre-rRNA is cleaved at sites A0 and A1 in the 5' ETS and site A2 in the ITS1, yielding a 20S pre-rRNA intermediate. The 20S pre-rRNA is packed in the pre-40S particle and processed at site D in the cytoplasm to generate the mature 18S rRNA. The 90S pre-ribosome is assembled progressively in a 5' to 3' order (Chaker-Margot et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016b). The 5' ETS associates with U3 snoRNA and 28 AFs into a 2.1 MDa particle. A subset of 5' ETS-associated factors exist as pre-assembled subcomplexes: UTPA, UTPB and U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) (Watkins et al., 2000; Grandi et al., 2002; Krogan et al., 2004). As the 18S rRNA region is transcribed, the U14 and snR30 snoRNAs and at least 37 AFs are recruited. The assembly of 90S is also highly dynamic. When the 18S rRNA is close to completion, U14 and snR30 snoRNAs and at least 14 protein factors assembled earlier to the 18S region begin to dissociate (Zhang et al., 2016b). The fully assembled 90S contains an unprocessed pre-18S rRNA, U3 snoRNA, approximately 51 assembly factors and 18 r-proteins with a molecular mass of 5.0 megadaltons (Zhang et al., 2016b). Elucidating the molecular mechanism of ribosome assembly requires detailed structural information of pre-ribosomes at different assembly stages. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been used to reveal structure for 60S pre-ribosomes (Leidig et al., 2014; Greber et al., 2016; Barrio-Garcia et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016) and a late pre-40S particle (Strunk et al., 2011). These structures represent late assembly intermediates in which ribosomal subunits already take shape. Very recently, a cryo-EM structure of Chaetomonum thermophilum (Ct) 90S was determined at 7.3 Å (Kornprobst et al., 2016). However, the reported model was rather incomplete with many unmodeled and unassigned densities due to limited resolution. Here, we determined three cryo-EM maps of Sc 90S pre-ribosome with resolution from 4.5 to 8.7 Å. The majority of the maps have been modeled and assigned to specific RNA and protein component based on fitting of crystal structures, de novo model building, chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry (CXMS) data. Our maps also contain many densities unseen in the Ct 90S map. The nearly complete 90S model provides major insights into the early assembly events of 40S subunit and the function of AFs. RESULTS. STRUCTURE DETERMINATION. We affinity purified 90S from yeast using Noc4 fused to a C-terminal tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag as bait (Grandi et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2016b). The purified Noc4-TAP sample contains a large number of proteins (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). We first constructed a density map for the Noc4-TAP particle at approximately 25 Å by using negative stain EM and with the mature 40S structure as the initial model (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–E). Then, we analyzed its structure with cryo-EM and obtained a density map with a resolution range of 6–20 Å and an overall resolution of 8.7 Å by the gold standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion (Figure 1A and D, Figure 1—figure supplement 2). RNA duplexes, protein α-helices and WD β-propeller structures were readily recognized in the density. However, the densities at the top and some peripheral regions are weak, probably due to the heterogeneity of Noc4-TAP particles that contain both unprocessed and processed pre-rRNAs (Zhang et al., 2016b). We next attempted to improve the sample homogeneity by genetic approach. The RNA helicases Dhr1 and Mtr4 function after the A0 cleavage of pre-rRNA (de la Cruz et al., 1998; Colley et al., 2000; Sardana et al., 2015). To stall ribosome maturation at certain stages, Dhr1 or Mtr4 was depleted and 90S was purified using Enp1-TAP as bait. Although Enp1 is present in both 90S and pre-40S particles (Schafer et al., 2003), the Enp1-TAP samples purified after Dhr1 or Mtr4 depletion contained mainly 90S particles, suggesting that 90S failed to develop into pre-40S. The two samples were subsequently analyzed by cryo-EM. Three density maps were constructed from the ΔDhr1 sample with resolution ranges of 6–20 Å and 7.8 to 9.5 Å overall resolution (Figure 1B and D, Figure 1—figure supplement 3). One map (state 1) is highly similar to but more complete than the Noc4-TAP map and the other two maps reveal different states of 90S and will be discussed elsewhere. The ΔMtr4 sample yielded a density map of a resolution range of 4–20 Å and an overall resolution of 4.5 Å that is also highly similar with the Noc4-TAP map (Figure 1C and D, Figure 1—figure supplement 4). Some bulky side chains of proteins are visible at the core region of the ΔMtr4 map (Figure 1—figure supplement 5). The three maps were essen",PMC,pos,1,pos,4446,pos_PMC,0.9803562,1
28251507,"Chemical shift assignments of the connexin37 carboxyl terminal domain. BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT. Connexins are the integral membrane proteins that comprise gap junction channels. These channels provide a pathway for direct cytoplasmic exchange of ions and low molecular weight metabolites (<1 kDa) between adjacent cells. As such, they provide a pathway for the propagation and/or amplification of signal transduction cascades triggered by cytokines, growth factors, and other cell signaling molecules involved in growth, development, and response to injury and disease. Gap junction channels are formed by the apposition of two connexons from adjacent cells, where each connexon is formed of six connexin proteins. Connexins are tetraspan transmembrane domain proteins with intracellular amino- and carboxyl-termini. There are 21 different connexin genes in the human genome with differential spatial-temporal expression throughout the body. In the arterial vasculature, gap junctions couple the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the endothelial cells (ECs), and also connect ECs to underlying smooth muscle cells via myoendothelial gap junctions (Haefliger et al., 2004). The major connexins in arterial vessels are connexin45 (Cx45), connexin43 (Cx43), connexin40 (Cx40), and connexin37 (Cx37). The expression of these connexins is not uniform and varies with vessel size and vascular territory (for review, see (Brisset et al., 2009)). The intercellular communication in the vasculature contributes to the regulation of resistance in different vascular beds according to metabolic needs, and therefore ultimately participates in the regulation of blood pressure. Pathological conditions, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and hypertension are associated with changes in connexin regulation and expression (for review, see (Morel, 2014)). Though there is significant sequence homology among connexins in the transmembrane and extracellular loops (see Figure 2, (Harris, 2001)), the major divergence in primary structures occurs in the cytoplasmic loop and carboxyl terminal (CT) domains. The CT plays a role in the trafficking, localization, and turnover of gap junction channels, as well as the level of gap junction intercellular communication via numerous post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions (Herve, 2007; Laird, 2010; Lampe and Lau, 2004; Thevenin et al., 2013). The CT is also important for regulating junctional conductance, pH sensitivity, and voltage sensitivity (Anumonwo et al., 2001; Moreno et al., 2002; Morley et al., 1996; Revilla et al., 1999). Structural studies from our labs revealed that the CT domain of connexins is predominately unstructured (Bouvier et al., 2008; Nelson et al., 2013; Sorgen et al., 2004b; Stauch et al., 2012). Intrinsically disordered domains are now well recognized to be loci for regulation of protein function because their conformations can readily be modulated by the local environment, phosphorylation, and by interaction with proteins and small-molecule binding partners. In the case of membrane proteins, like connexins, intrinsically disordered domains play an important role in cell signaling events by allowing many different binding partners with both high specificity and low affinity to rapidly switch between molecular partners, thus activating alternative signaling pathways (Dunker et al., 2002). We and others have shown that the connexin CT can bind multiple proteins (>20 known for Cx43), some of which, where tested, modulate channel function (for review see (Gilleron et al., 2012)). Structural information of the Cx43CT, Cx40CT, and Cx45CT domains has advanced our understanding of gap junction regulation via protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation induced structural changes, and channel regulation. However, to date, no high resolution structural information exists for the Cx37CT. Here, we report the sequence-specific assignments for the Cx37CT domain. These assignments will be useful for mapping the binding sites for potential molecular partners, including inter- and intra-molecular connexin domains. METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS. The recombinant Mus musculus Cx37CT (residues C233-V333) was subcloned into the pGEX-KT and pET-14b bacterial expression vectors according to standard protocol. Expression and purification of the 15N-13C-labeled Cx37CT was achieved following a previously published protocol (Kieken et al., 2010). Briefly, the pGEX-KT vector containing the Cx37CT was transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3) bacterial strain and grown in M9 minimum medium supplemented with 15N-ammonium chloride and 13C-glucose. After induction with IPTG (1 mM) at a cell density of 0.6 (OD at 600 nm), cells were grown for an additional 4 hours, pelleted, and lysed in 1× PBS lysis buffer using an EmulsiFlex-C3 homogenizer. After incubating the GST-tag Cx37CT with glutathione resin, non-specific binding proteins were removed by sequential washes with 2× PBS and 1× PBS in presence of 2 mM DTT, at pH 6.0. The GST-tag was subsequently cleaved overnight at 4°C by incubation with thrombin (7 units per liter of culture). The Cx37CT was then subjected to cation exchange chromatography for further purification (HiTrap SP HP column; Elution with an increasing gradient of sodium chloride in 1× PBS at pH 7.0 in presence of 2 mM DTT) using an ÄKTA FPLC. Fractions containing the Cx37CT were pooled and dialyzed against 1× PBS, 2 mM DTT, at pH 6.0 overnight before concentrating the protein using a 3 kDa Amicon® Ultra centrifugal filter. Final NMR sample contained 650 μM of 15N-13C-isotopically labeled Cx37CT protein in 1× PBS, 4% D2O, 2 mM DTT, at pH 5.8. NMR data were acquired at 7°C using a Bruker Avance-III HD 600 MHz spectrometer outfitted with a z-axis PFG “inverse” triple-resonance cold probe. HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO 3D experiments were collected to carry out the backbone sequential assignment while the 3D 15N-TOCSYHSQC, 15N-NOESYHSQC, 13C-HCCH-TOCSY, and 13C- NOESYHSQC experiments were used to assign the chemical shifts of the side chain at",PMC,pos,1,pos,4449,pos_PMC,0.9946568,1

OBJECTIVE Our objective was to describe the first reported use of an axillary brachial plexus block to treat the entrapment of a transradial artery catheter due to vasospasm. CASE REPORT A 42-year-old man undergoing transradial arterial cardiac catheterization suffered arterial vasospasm causing the catheter to become entrapped and refractory to conservative (warm compresses) and standard pharmacologic interventions (intracatheter verapamil, intravenous infusions of nitroglycerin and nicardipine, and subcutaneous lidocaine and topical nitroglycerin). Anesthesia was consulted, and attempts at catheter removal under monitored anesthesia and general anesthesia failed. Finally, in order to avoid surgical intervention, an ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block with mepivacaine was performed, resulting in easy removal of the catheter. CONCLUSIONS Axillary brachial plexus nerve blocks are an effective, efficient, and safe intervention with a wide range of indications.

28298447,"Structural and functional characterization of Caenorhabditis elegans α-catenin reveals constitutive binding to β-catenin and F-actin. Intercellular epithelial junctions formed by classical cadherins, β-catenin, and the actin-binding protein α-catenin link the actin cytoskeletons of adjacent cells into a structural continuum. These assemblies transmit forces through the tissue and respond to intracellular and extracellular signals. However, the mechanisms of junctional assembly and regulation are poorly understood. Studies of cadherin-catenin assembly in a number of metazoans have revealed both similarities and unexpected differences in the biochemical properties of the cadherin·catenin complex that likely reflect the developmental and environmental requirements of different tissues and organisms. Here, we report the structural and biochemical characterization of HMP-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans α-catenin homolog, and compare it with mammalian α-catenin. HMP-1 shares overall similarity in structure and actin-binding properties, but displayed differences in conformational flexibility and allosteric regulation from mammalian α-catenin. HMP-1 bound filamentous actin with an affinity in the single micromolar range, even when complexed with the β-catenin homolog HMP-2 or when present in a complex of HMP-2 and the cadherin homolog HMR-1, indicating that HMP-1 binding to F-actin is not allosterically regulated by the HMP-2·HMR-1 complex. The middle (i.e. M) domain of HMP-1 appeared to be less conformationally flexible than mammalian α-catenin, which may underlie the dampened effect of HMP-2 binding on HMP-1 actin-binding activity compared with that of the mammalian homolog. In conclusion, our data indicate that HMP-1 constitutively binds β-catenin and F-actin, and although the overall structure and function of HMP-1 and related α-catenins are similar, the vertebrate proteins appear to be under more complex conformational regulation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4464,pos_MEDLINE,0.99800056,1
28306513,"Tardigrades Use Intrinsically Disordered Proteins to Survive Desiccation. SUMMARY. Tardigrades are microscopic animals that survive a remarkable array of stresses, including desiccation. How tardigrades survive desiccation has remained a mystery for more than 250 years. Trehalose, a disaccharide essential for several organisms to survive drying, is detected at low levels or not at all in some tardigrade species, indicating that tardigrades possess potentially novel mechanisms for surviving desiccation. Here we show that tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are essential for desiccation tolerance. TDP genes are constitutively expressed at high levels or induced during desiccation in multiple tardigrade species. TDPs are required for tardigrade desiccation tolerance, and these genes are sufficient to increase desiccation tolerance when expressed in heterologous systems. TDPs form non-crystalline amorphous solids (vitrify) upon desiccation, and this vitrified state mirrors their protective capabilities. Our study identifies TDPs as functional mediators of tardigrade desiccation tolerance, expanding our knowledge of the roles and diversity of disordered proteins involved in stress tolerance. INTRODUCTION. Tardigrades (water bears) comprise a phylum of microscopic animals renowned for their ability to survive a vast array of environmental extremes, including essentially complete desiccation for up to a decade (Goldstein and Blaxter, 2002). Although they have fascinated scientists for more than 250 years, little is known about how tardigrades survive such extreme environmental stresses, and no molecular mediators of tardigrade desiccation tolerance have been experimentally confirmed. The disaccharide trehalose has been proposed and often assumed to play a role in mediating desiccation tolerance in tardigrades (Hengherr et al., 2008; Jönsson and Persson, 2010; Westh and Ramløv, 1991). Trehalose is essential for some organisms to survive desiccation and is thought to protect organisms by vitrifying their cellular contents (Erkut et al., 2011; Sakurai et al., 2008; Tapia and Koshland, 2014). However, some desiccation-tolerant animals do not require or even appear to make this sugar (Lapinski and Tunnacliffe, 2003). Currently, the use and presence of trehalose in tardigrades are unclear; some studies report low levels of this sugar, while others failed to identify trehalose at all in the same species (Guidetti et al., 2011; Hengherr et al., 2008; Jönsson and Persson, 2010; Westh and Ramløv, 1991). In addition to trehalose and other sugars, a number of protein families and classes have been implicated in mediating desiccation tolerance in other systems, including heat-shock proteins, antioxidant enzymes, and some intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) families (Hincha and Thalhammer, 2012; Hoekstra et al., 2001). This latter class of proteins is enigmatic, in that unlike typical globular proteins, they lack persistent tertiary structure. In the past two decades, myriad cellular roles for IDPs have emerged, including roles in transcription, post-translational modification, development, cellular organization, and abiotic stress tolerance (Chakrabortee et al., 2012; Garay-Arroyo et al., 2000; Hincha and Thalhammer, 2012; Iakoucheva et al., 2004; Nott et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2015). However, the role of IDPs in tardigrade desiccation tolerance remains untested. Although no molecular mediators of desiccation tolerance have been identified in tardigrades, one clue as to how these animals survive desiccation comes from the observation (Figure 1A) that different tardigrade species survive drying at different rates, but all species tested die if dried too quickly (Wright, 1989). This trend suggests that tardigrades need time to produce protectants, a theory supported by the recent evidence that de novo transcription and translation are required for the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini to robustly survive desiccation (Kondo et al., 2015). Here we present evidence that tardigrades upregulate the expression of genes encoding tardigrade-specific IDPs in response to drying. Disruption of gene function for several TDPs, using RNAi, results in severely diminished desiccation tolerance. Furthermore, the heterologous expression of TDPs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is sufficient to increase desiccation tolerance in these systems, and purified TDPs protect desiccation-sensitive proteins in vitro. Like trehalose, purified and heterologously expressed TDPs vitrify upon desiccation, and this vitreous state mirrors the protective capabilities of these proteins. These findings identify TDPs as functional mediators of tardigrade desiccation tolerance and expand our understanding of the diversity and roles of IDPs. We anticipate that these findings will build a foundation for pursuing long-term goals of the desiccation tolerance field, including the engineering of desiccation-tolerant crops and the development of technologies for the dry preservation of pharmaceuticals, cells, and tissues. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. IDENTIFICATION OF LIKELY MEDIATORS OF TARDIGRADE DESICCATION TOLERANCE. To test whether tardigrades produce protectants that are sufficient to protect against desiccation, we assayed whether slowly dried (preconditioned) tardigrades can survive subsequent drying at higher, typically non-survivable, rates. Specimens of the tardigrade H. dujardini that had been dried slowly could subsequently survive more rapid desiccation (Figure 1B), suggesting that a sufficient protectant(s) was made during slow drying. This finding, in addition to the fact that H. dujardini requires de novo transcription and translation to robustly survive desiccation (Kondo et al., 2015), makes H. dujardini attractive for differential gene expression studies. To identify potential mediators of desiccation tolerance, genes induced by drying, in an unbiased fashion we sequenced and performed differential gene expression analysis on transcriptomes of hydrated and slow",PMC,pos,1,pos,4467,pos_PMC,0.99508506,1
28347672,"Structural and kinetic analysis of Schistosoma mansoni Adenylosuccinate Lyase (SmADSL). Schistosoma mansoni is the parasite responsible for schistosomiasis, a disease that affects about 218 million people worldwide. Currently, both direct treatment and disease control initiatives rely on chemotherapy using a single drug, praziquantel. Concerns over the possibility of resistance developing to praziquantel, have stimulated efforts to develop new drugs for the treatment of schistosomiasis. Schistosomes do not have the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, and instead depend entirely on the purine salvage pathway to supply its need for purines. The purine salvage pathway has been reported as a potential target for developing new drugs against schistosomiasis. Adenylosuccinate lyase (SmADSL) is an enzyme in this pathway, which cleaves adenylosuccinate (ADS) into adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and fumarate. SmADSL kinetic characterization was performed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using both ADS and SAICAR as substrates. Structures of SmADSL in Apo form and in complex with AMP were elucidated by x-ray crystallography revealing a highly conserved tetrameric structure required for their function since the active sites are formed from residues of three different subunits. The active sites are also highly conserved between species and it is difficult to identify a potent species-specific inhibitor for the development of new therapeutic agents. In contrast, several mutagenesis studies have demonstrated the importance of dimeric interface residues in the stability of the quaternary structure of the enzyme. The lower conservation of these residues between SmADSL and human ADSL could be used to lead the development of anti-schistosomiasis drugs based on disruption of subunit interfaces. These structures and kinetics data add another layer of information to Schistosoma mansoni purine salvage pathway.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4477,pos_MEDLINE,0.99736834,1
28355271,"Transient helicity in intrinsically disordered Axin-1 studied by NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. INTRODUCTION. The structure–function paradigm of molecular biology, stating that every protein exerting a function requires one specific three-dimensional form, has been under revision since the turn of the century [1]. Evidence has accumulated that some active proteins do not adopt a single stable energy minimum at a folded structure but are intrinsically disordered in solution (intrinsically disordered proteins: IDPs) [2, 3]. Distinct sequence patterns predicted to form intrinsically disordered states in solution have been identified in genome sequences of many forms of life but are more abundant in highly evolved eukaryotes [4, 5]. About 15–45% of eukaryotic proteins have segments of significant disorder [6] where 30 or more consecutive residues are in a disordered state [7, 8]. The relative frequency of IDPs in the more communicative eukaryotes compared to prokaryotes is reflected in their important role in transcription, translation, cell cycle regulation and cell signaling [9–13]. Analysis of the SwissProt data bank revealed that many diseases, including cancer, malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), deafness, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, albinism, and prion protein related diseases, are correlated with proteins predicted to contain disordered regions [14]. Several experimental techniques can be used to qualitatively characterize the disordered nature of proteins [6]. Obtaining information on the ensemble of disordered states or transiently formed structures is, however, experimentally difficult, as typically only averages over time or large sample sizes can be evaluated. Also IDP systems tend to be underdetermined, i.e. the number of experimental observables is below the number of conformational states. Computational studies are, in principle, ideally suited for the study of IDPs, allowing single molecule investigation with a spatial resolution up to single atoms and a time resolution of femtoseconds [15]. Especially in combination with experimental techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy an atomistic understanding of the range of accessible conformations is available [16, 17]. Molecular dynamics(MD) simulations model protein behavior by propagating all atom positions according to Newton’s equations of motion [18] and estimating forces on atoms via an empirical force field. Current force fields describe folded globular proteins well [19], but overstabilize protein–protein interactions [20] and often fail to reproduce realistic IDP behavior [21–23]. Most force fields succeed in predicting qualitatively whether or not a region is disordered, but for further details, like dynamics or sampled sub-states, results vastly differ between different force fields [23]. Two groups have approached this problem by parameterizing new water models. Both approaches tackle the overpopulation of collapsed states with current force fields by modifying the solute–solvent interactions. Best et al. [21] argue that pure water properties are reproduced well by current water models and thus water–water interactions should not be altered. For their adjusted water, termed amber03ws, the strength of solvent–solute van der Waals interactions is increased by a factor of γ = 1.1, obtained from fits to the temperature profile of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) data for the Csp M34 protein. Extensive tests of the new force field included comparison with Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) data, solvation free energies of amino acid analogues, protein self-association, the intrinsic structure propensity in short peptides, the helix-coil transition, the folding of mini-proteins and the stability of folded proteins. According to another approach by Piana et al. [22], the dispersion component of the intermolecular interaction energy is underestimated in current water models. They fitted the C6 term of Lennard-Jones interactions to quantum level computations and adjusted partial charges and C12 to fit density and vaporization enthalpy temperature profiles of their TIP4P-D water model. The water model was tested in a total simulation time of 830μs by checking the solvation free energies of side chains, radii of gyration of disordered proteins and a comparison with SAXS, FRET and NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data for α-Synuclein. Both water models performed well in test simulations and in particular sampled larger radii of gyration in agreement with experiments. Aside from radii of gyration MD force fields have to reproduce very diverse properties of disordered regions. Often, disordered regions in proteins are involved in the interaction with other biological binding partners and can fold upon binding adopting different conformations. Among these, the α-helical structure is the most abundant secondary structure. Hence, in practice one is interested in the ability of force field simulations to distinguish segments from IDPs that have an intrinsic preference for adopting helical secondary structure and can bind involving a conformational selection mechanism or prefer fully disordered states. Here we use the intrinsically disordered, transiently folded Axin-1 protein as model system to compare computational approaches for conformational characterization of IDPs. Axin-1 is a key protein component of the Wnt signaling pathway [24] acting as a scaffolding protein, assembling the β-catenin destruction complex that phosphorylates and subsequently polyubiquitinates β-catenin [25–27]. The central region of the 862 residue protein Axin-1 (residues 212-780) is highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation [28] and has been proposed to be largely intrinsically disordered [29]. Nevertheless, the disordered region is essential for β-catenin trapping and subsequent degradation in the β–catenin destruction complex. For these purposes, the disordered region of Axin-1 harbors binding sites for β-catenin (residues 466-480)",PMC,pos,1,pos,4482,pos_PMC,0.9943909,1
28446700,"Rapid polygenic response to secondary contact in a hybrid species. Secondary contact between closely related species can have genetic consequences. Competition for essential resources may lead to divergence in heritable traits that reduces interspecific competition leading to increased rate of genetic divergence. Conversely, hybridization and backcrossing can lead to genetic convergence. Here, we study a population of a hybrid species, the Italian sparrow (Passer italiae), before and after it came into secondary contact with one of its parent species, the Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis), in 2013. We demonstrate strong consequences of interspecific competition: Italian sparrows were kept away from a popular feeding site by its parent species, resulting in poorer body condition and a significant drop in population size. Although no significant morphological change could be detected, after only 3 years of sympatry, the Italian sparrows had diverged significantly from the Spanish sparrows across a set of 81 protein-coding genes. These temporal genetic changes are mirrored by genetic divergence observed in older sympatric Italian sparrow populations within the same area of contact. Compared with microallopatric birds, sympatric ones are genetically more diverged from Spanish sparrows.

28492224,"Endogenous adenosine maintains cartilage homeostasis and exogenous adenosine inhibits osteoarthritis progression. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis, affecting up to 25% of the population over 65, and 12% of all cases may be caused by prior joint trauma12. Worldwide in its distribution, the incidence of OA increases with age and the resulting pain, loss of joint function and mobility, social isolation, and a broadly reduced quality of life make OA a condition with a high medical and social impact. Current treatment options are less than optimal and do not correct the underlying problem with the result that joint replacement surgery is often the eventual outcome3. OA is characterized by changes in every structure in the joint, including cartilage destruction, synovial inflammation, osteophyte formation, enthesophytes, and significant bony changes4. The central player in OA is the chondrocyte, which responds to excess mechanical loading by releasing inflammatory mediators and proteolytic enzymes causing further cartilage damage5. In addition, age-related inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of OA6. Adenosine is an endogenously produced physiological regulator and its intracellular and extracellular concentration is tightly controlled by oxygen consumption, cellular stress and mitochondrial functionality. Extracellular adenosine derives mainly from hydrolysis of ATP (primarily, but not exclusively, by the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73) and mediates its effects via activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR and A3R). Adenosine has long been known to regulate inflammation and immune responses78 and work from our lab and others have demonstrated the importance of adenosine and its receptors in osteoblast, osteoclast, and bone marrow homeostasis9101112131415161718192021. Prior studies have suggested that adenosine receptors also regulate chondrocyte physiology and pathology in response to inflammatory stimuli in rodent, equine, bovine and human chondrocytes2223242526 although the specific receptor(s) involved are not identified. Removal of endogenous adenosine (by addition of adenosine deaminase) or blockade of A2AR leads to cartilage degradation in equine cartilage explants27, although equine purine metabolism differs from other species as adenosine deaminase, present in lymphocytes, plasma and extracellular fluid of most species, is not present in horse lymphocytes or serum2829. A3R stimulation has been reported to diminish OA development in a chemically induced model of OA30, principally due to the anti-inflammatory effects of A3R agonists. Mice lacking A2AR were first developed by Chen et al. in 1999 (ref. 31) and, in general, these mice have few obvious defects. Interestingly, they develop osteopenia as a result of an increase in osteoclast number and function and they respond abnormally to a variety of stressors reflecting the loss of the A2AR. However, as these mice age we note that they have increasing difficulty in grabbing food, walking and mating. We asked, therefore, whether the diminished mobility of A2AR-deficient mice might be due to intrinsic joint disease. We report here that mice lacking A2AR spontaneously develop OA, characterized by altered cartilage composition and loss of cartilage, presence of chondrocyte hypertrophy and osteophytes, and increased subchondral bone density. Rat articular cartilage explants release ATP and adenosine and load bearing in the physiological range induces further increases in extracellular adenosine levels. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), an inflammatory mediator that contributes to OA, diminishes ATP and adenosine release from cultured chondrocytes. Physiological loading of rat tibia increases adenosine release and is abrogated by IL-1β treatment. Consistent with the role of adenosine in maintaining cartilage homeostasis, mice lacking CD73 also develop signs of OA. Finally, in a rat model of post-traumatic OA, intra-articular injection of liposomal suspensions containing adenosine prevent development of OA and this effect is abrogated by co-injection of an A2AR antagonist, but not an A2BR antagonist. These findings indicate that extracellular adenosine, acting at A2AR, has a critical function in the maintainenance of cartilage homeostasis and that adenosine replacement may be a new approach to treat or prevent OA. RESULTS. MOBILITY OF A2AR KO MICE. Although the mobility of A2AR knockout (KO) mice appeared to be limited we confirmed that deletion of A2AR leads to loss of mobility by subjecting wild-type (WT) and A2AR KO mice to an open field test to quantitate movement over time. The A2AR KO mice moved a shorter distance than WT mice (Fig. 1a, A2AR KO=664±123 cm versus WT 1,404±129 cm; P<0.001 (Student's T-test), moved less quickly (velocity for A2AR KO=1.11±0.21 cm s−1 versus WT 2.34±0.22 cm s−1; P<0.001 (Student's T-test)) with increased time spent in the border of the cage (A2AR KO=575.5±7.7 s versus WT=370.2±45.6 cm s−1; P<0.001 (Student's T-test)) and immobile (A2AR KO=530.8±11.5 s versus WT 442.3±15.4 s; P<0.001 (Student's T-test)). The frequency of rearing, a normal mouse exploratory behaviour (measured in the first 10 min of the field test), was also reduced in A2AR KO mice (15±4 times per 10 min, P<0.0001 (Student's T-test)) compared to WT mice (51±7 times per 10 min). The capacity of the A2AR KO mice to run on the rotarod apparatus with a constant acceleration was also reduced compared to the WT mice (A2AR KO=86±11 s versus WT=145±22 s, P<0.01 (Student's T-test)).

Prolyl-tRNA synthetase (PRS) is a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family of enzymes and catalyzes the synthesis of prolyl-tRNAPro using ATP, l-proline, and tRNAPro as substrates. An ATP-dependent PRS inhibitor, halofuginone, was shown to suppress autoimmune responses, suggesting that the inhibition of PRS is a potential therapeutic approach for inflammatory diseases. Although a few PRS inhibitors have been derivatized from natural sources or substrate mimetics, small-molecule human PRS inhibitors have not been reported. In this study, we discovered a novel series of pyrazinamide PRS inhibitors from a compound library using pre-transfer editing activity of human PRS enzyme. Steady-state biochemical analysis on the inhibitory mode revealed its distinctive characteristics of inhibition with proline uncompetition and ATP competition. The binding activity of a representative compound was time-dependently potentiated by the presence of l-proline with Kd of 0.76 nM. Thermal shift assays demonstrated the stabilization of PRS in complex with l-proline and pyrazinamide PRS inhibitors. The binding mode of the PRS inhibitor to the ATP site of PRS enzyme was elucidated using the ternary complex crystal structure with l-proline. The results demonstrated the different inhibitory and binding mode of pyrazinamide PRS inhibitors from preceding halofuginone. Furthermore, the PRS inhibitor inhibited intracellular protein synthesis via a different mode than halofuginone.

28505309,"The herpes viral transcription factor ICP4 forms a novel DNA recognition complex. INTRODUCTION. Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) causes lifelong infections, typified by the sporadic appearance of acute localized symptoms such as cold sores, inter-dispersed by prolonged asymptomatic periods where the virus remains in a latent state. HSV-1 and other alphaherpesviruses can also cause more severe diseases, such as keratitis and encephalitis, and have been linked with the development of Alzheimer's disease (1). Due to HSV's persistence in certain types of cells and life-long infection, it has also been modified for the development of gene delivery systems for the treatment of genetic diseases and cancer, and therefore a detailed understanding of gene regulation within this virus is invaluable (2,3). During herpes infection a sequential cascade of viral gene expression is triggered. Initially five ‘immediate-early’ (IE) genes (4) followed by more numerous early (E) and then late (L) genes are transcribed (5). The IE gene product, infected cell protein 4 (ICP4) is a transcriptional regulator with a prominent role within this cascade (6,7). ICP4 can induce the expression of E and L genes (8,9), while conversely it can act as a repressor notably of itself and also other IE genes (10–12). It carries out these functions by interacting with DNA and modulating the activity of the cellular RNA polymerase II on viral genes (13–16). HSV-1 ICP4 is a 1298 amino acid nuclear phosphoprotein that has been the subject of extensive biochemical studies, which have established that it homo-dimerizes and adopts an elongated conformation (17–19). ICP4 is composed of four major domains: N-terminal activation, DNA binding (DBD), linker region and C-terminal activation (CTA) (Figure 1A). Sequence homology to helix-turn-helix and uracil-DNA glycosylase domains was observed for the DBD and CTA domains respectively (16,20), other domains are predicted to be predominately disordered. ICP4 homo-dimerization is mediated by the DBD, this region interacts preferentially with a bi-partite and asymmetric DNA consensus sequence RTCGTCnnYnYSG (where R is a purine, Y is a pyrimidine, S is a C or G and n is any base) (17,20–22). Extensive studies using ICP4 point mutants have probed the functional significance of residues within the protein (Figure 1B and Supplementary Table S1) (13,14,16). These studies highlighted the functional importance of the DBD as mutations that disrupted DNA interactions and also negatively affected both the transactivation and transrepression functions of ICP4, along with viral replication (13). Interpretation of these effects in the context of the structure of ICP4 was however not possible thus far. The transrepression function occurs via the interaction of ICP4 with a consensus DNA sequence in viral promoter regions, for example ICP4's own gene (IE3) contains a consensus site located in proximity to the transcription start site (23,24), to which it can bind with nano-molar affinity (25,26). At these repression sites, ICP4 forms a tripartite complex (TPC) with the cellular proteins TFIIB plus TATA-binding protein (TBP) or TFIID (27). Formation of this complex is functionally important as mutants of ICP4 that cannot form a TPC but retain an ability to bind DNA are unable to repress transcription (27,28). The genes of the remaining four HSV-1 IE proteins also contain sites matching the ICP4 consensus sequence. Similarly, ICP4 mediated transactivation also involves the DBD (13), likely via interaction with consensus DNA sites present in E and L genes, however intriguingly these sites are not essential for ICP4 function possibly due to the protein's ability to bind non-consensus DNA (29–31). ICP4 constructs containing both the DBD and the CTA domains can oligomerize on DNA, a property that may increase DNA affinity or specificity for the E or L genes (26). In addition, activation is mediated by interactions with cellular transcription factors via the N-terminal activation domain, specifically TFIID and mediator, and further enhanced by additional interactions with the CTA domain (32,33). A further layer of complexity to ICP4 function is provided by the herpes simplex IE protein ICP0 and the ORF O protein, both of which have been identified as antagonists to the ICP4–DNA interaction (34,35). Therefore the DNA binding domain of ICP4 has a role in transcriptional regulation of viral genes throughout viral replication during lytic infection, but its sequence-specificity is most crucial for interactions with IE promoters. Despite the general importance of ICP4 for HSV infection and the prominent role of the DBD in gene regulatory functions, no structural data were available for ICP4, and the mode of viral DNA recognition was unclear. To understand the details of ICP4–DNA recognition, we have solved crystal structures of the DBD in complex with DNA fragments from its own promoter. Additionally, we used a combination of solution techniques (small angle X-Ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), multi-angle light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation) plus surface-plasmon resonance experiments to determine the contribution to DNA binding of flanking intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) not observed in the crystallography data. Together, the data revealed the details of both specific DNA recognition and dimerization of ICP4, and finally clarifies the results of previous mutational studies. The reported results should inform future functional studies in HSV-1 and provide an example of the synergistic action of globular and disordered regions for tuning DNA binding specificity. MATERIALS AND METHODS. CLONING AND EXPRESSION. Sequence conservation (36), predictions of secondary structure and disorder (37) (Figure 1A and B) along with data from the literature (13,14,16,22,38) suggested the complete DNA binding domain (DBD) of ICP4 is comprised within residues 258–487.

The synaptopodin family of proteins consists of at least 3 members: synaptopodin, the synaptopodin 2 proteins, and the synaptopodin 2-like proteins. Each family member has at least 3 isoforms that are produced by alternative splicing. Synaptopodin family members are basic proteins that are rich in proline and have little regular 2° or 3° structure at physiological temperature, pH and ionic strength. Like other natively unfolded proteins, synaptopodin family members have multiple binding partners including actin and other actin-binding proteins. Several members of the synaptopodin family have been shown to stimulate actin polymerization and to bundle actin filaments either on their own or in collaboration with other proteins. Synaptopodin 2 has been shown to accelerate nucleation of actin filament formation and to induce actin bundling. The actin polymerization activity is inhibited by Ca2+-calmodulin. Synaptopodin 2 proteins are localized in Z-bands of striated and heart muscle and dense bodies of smooth muscle cells.

28516954,"Histone deacetylase 10 structure and molecular function as a polyamine deacetylase. Polyamines such as putrescine, spermidine and spermine are ubiquitous and essential in all living systems123. Typically present at millimolar concentrations, these cellular polycations bind to nucleic acids and other anionic macromolecules to stabilize structure and regulate function in myriad biological processes. Polyamine metabolism is highly regulated and consists of an elaborately orchestrated balance of cellular uptake, intracellular transport, biosynthesis and catabolism (Fig. 1a)4. Dysregulation of polyamine metabolism is frequently associated with cancer and other hyperproliferative diseases, and enzymes of polyamine metabolism are emerging drug targets56. A critical strategy for the regulation of polyamine function is reversible acetylation. This strategy is analogous to the regulation of protein function by reversible lysine acetylation through reactions catalysed by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs, also known more generally as lysine acetyltransferases and lysine deacetylases). In eukaryotes, this branch of polyamine metabolism is partially compartmentalized in the nucleus (Fig. 1a). Spermidine is acetylated at the N8 position by an N-acetyltransferase in the cell nucleus7 and then exported to the cytosol, where it is deacetylated by a metal-dependent N8-acetylspermidine deacetylase, also known as polyamine deacetylase (PDAC)89. The substrate specificity of PDAC is very strict, as it does not deacetylate cytosolic N1-acetylspermidine or N1-acetylspermine10. Selective inhibition of PDAC activity in HeLa cells increases N8-acetylspermidine levels but not acetylated histone levels, so PDAC activity is distinct from HDAC activity11. To date, the identity of the cytosolic PDAC in eukaryotes has remained elusive. However, selective inhibitors have been developed that block mammalian PDAC activity111213. Our recent studies of a bacterial PDAC14 belonging to the arginase-deacetylase superfamily1516 led us to suggest that the enigmatic PDAC might be one of the two cytosolic class IIb Zn2+-dependent HDACs, HDAC6 or HDAC10. We recently reported the X-ray crystal structures of both catalytic domains (CDs) of HDAC6, showing that a conserved active site lysine serves as a gatekeeper in CD1, in that it dictates specificity for carboxy-terminal acetyllysine substrates bearing a negatively charged α-carboxylate group17. In all other human HDACs, this residue is otherwise conserved as leucine or methionine, except for HDAC10 in which it is a glutamate (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). Accordingly, we hypothesized that this strictly conserved glutamate could similarly serve as a gatekeeper to confer specificity for positively charged acetylpolyamine substrates. HDAC10 is highly expressed in the liver, spleen and kidney1819, enriched in the cytoplasm19 and resistant to inhibition by sodium butyrate20. These properties match the tissue distribution, subcellular localization and inhibitor sensitivity of mammalian PDAC8910111213. Thus, we further hypothesized that HDAC10 might be a PDAC. Here we report enzymological studies conclusively demonstrating that HDAC10 is a robust PDAC and a poor lysine deacetylase. In addition, we report the 2.85-Å resolution crystal structure of HDAC10 complexed with a polyamine transition state analogue inhibitor. This structure reveals that the conserved glutamate gatekeeper and a sterically constricted active site confer specificity for N8-acetylspermidine hydrolysis and disfavour acetyllysine hydrolysis. RESULTS. HDAC10 IS A PDAC. To determine steady-state kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of a variety of acetylpolyamine and acetyllysine substrates, we prepared full-length recombinant HDAC10 from human (H. sapiens, hHDAC10) and zebrafish (D. rerio, zHDAC10). The CDs of these orthologues are highly similar based on 63%/79% sequence identity/similarity; only full-length constructs yielded soluble proteins. We first assayed the lysine deacetylase activity of these constructs against two commercially available aminomethylcoumarin (AMC)-conjugated fluorogenic acetyllysine peptides, GAK(ac)-AMC and RGK(ac)-AMC (molecular structures of all substrates are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2). Both hHDAC10 and zHDAC10 exhibited very low activity with these peptides (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). These measurements were consistent with earlier studies reporting that HDAC10 activity was not measurable using fluorogenic peptide substrates21. We also tested activity with 11 non-fluorogenic acetyllysine substrates using a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)-based discontinuous assay17 to avoid potential steric clashes that might occur with the bulky AMC group. These substrates included K(ac)NL and GAK(ac)NLQ, which mimic the peptide segment containing K73 in the proposed HDAC10 substrate MutS homologue 2 (MSH2)22. Again, we observed no or very low catalytic activity (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). In comparison with its closest relative, the cytosolic isozyme HDAC6 (ref. 17), HDAC10 was clearly not an efficient lysine deacetylase. We next tested the PDAC activity of hHDAC10 and zHDAC10 against several polyamine substrates using the LC–MS assay (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1). Both enzymes exhibited optimal catalytic activity and specificity for the hydrolysis of N8-acetylspermidine. For hHDAC10 and zHDAC10, kcat/KM=2,900±200 and 4,600±300 M−1 s−1, respectively; in comparison, N1-acetylspermidine was a poor substrate with kcat/KM=24±5 and 7±2 M−1 s−1, respectively. Substrate specificity trends observed for zHDAC10 and hHDAC10 matched those of the previously reported mammalian N8-acetylspermidine deacetylase activity91011. As a positive control, we measured the N8-acetylspermidine deacetylase activity of Mycoplana ramosa acetylpolyamine amidohydrolase (APAH), which exhibits a similar preference for PDAC activity over acetyllysine deacetylase activity but which also exhibits broader polyamine substrate specific",PMC,pos,1,pos,4518,pos_PMC,0.99595356,1
28551817,"Discovery of novel inhibitors for Leishmania nucleoside diphosphatase kinase (NDK) based on its structural and functional characterization. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDKs) are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the transfer of the γ-phosphate moiety from an NTP donor to an NDP acceptor, crucial for maintaining the cellular level of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). The inability of trypanosomatids to synthesize purines de novo and their dependence on the salvage pathway makes NDK an attractive target to develop drugs for the diseases they cause. Here we report the discovery of novel inhibitors for Leishmania NDK based on the structural and functional characterization of purified recombinant NDK from Leishmania amazonensis. Recombinant LaNDK possesses auto-phosphorylation, phosphotransferase and kinase activities with Histidine 117 playing an essential role.

28554535,"A phosphorylation-motif for tuneable helix stabilisation in intrinsically disordered proteins - Lessons from the sodium proton exchanger 1 (NHE1). Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are involved in many pivotal cellular processes including phosphorylation and signalling. The structural and functional effects of phosphorylation of IDPs remain poorly understood and difficult to predict. Thus, a need exists to identify motifs that confer phosphorylation-dependent perturbation of the local preferences for forming e.g. helical structures as well as motifs that do not. The disordered distal tail of the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) is six-times phosphorylated (S693, S723, S726, S771, T779, S785) by the mitogen activated protein kinase 2 (MAPK1, ERK2). Using NMR spectroscopy, we found that two out of those six phosphorylation sites had a stabilizing effect on transient helices. One of these was further investigated by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy as well as by molecular dynamic simulations, which confirmed the stabilizing effect and resulted in the identification of a short linear motif for helix stabilisation: [S/T]-P-{3}-[R/K] where [S/T] is the phosphorylation-site. By analysing IDP and phosphorylation site databases we found that the motif is significantly enriched around known phosphorylation sites, supporting a potential wider-spread role in phosphorylation-mediated regulation of intrinsically disordered proteins. The identification of such motifs is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of cellular signalling, and is crucial for the development of predictors for the structural effect of phosphorylation; a tool of relevance for understanding disease-promoting mutations that for example interfere with signalling for instance through constitutive active and often cancer-promoting signalling.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4529,pos_MEDLINE,0.99776125,1
28572385,"Structural basis for antibody-mediated neutralization of Lassa virus. Lassa virus (LASV) is the etiologic agent of Lassa fever, an often-fatal viral hemorrhagic fever that is endemic in West Africa, with an estimated 20 to 70% lethality (1, 2). The virus appears to have extended its geographic spread (3), and outbreaks in 2016 were accompanied by demonstrated human-to-human transmission in Africa and Germany (4). There is no approved Lassa fever vaccine, and the nucleoside analog ribavirin and supportive therapy are the only treatment options currently in use for LASV infection. Attempts to use convalescent plasma against LASV have met with variable results (5). LASV is a member of the arenavirus family, which includes more than 30 known pathogens that exist on all populated continents on Earth. The Old World family of arenaviruses contains LASV; lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which causes febrile illness, neurological disease, and birth defects with a 2 to 5% seroprevalence in North America and Europe; and the 80% lethal hemorrhagic fever virus Lujo (LUJV), which emerged in Southern Africa in 2008 (6). Arenaviruses in the New World category include Machupo virus (MACV) and Junín virus (JUNV), the causative agents of Bolivian and Argentinian hemorrhagic fever, respectively, as well as numerous other agents such as Sabía and Guanarito. As the sole antigen on the viral surface, the arenavirus glycoprotein complex (GPC) is the primary target of protective humoral immune responses (7, 8) and a focus for vaccine design efforts. The virion form of GPC is a trimer of heterodimers, each containing the receptor-binding subunit GP1 and the transmembrane, fusion-mediating subunit GP2 (9). GPC also encodes an unusual stable signal peptide (SSP) that has many critical functions and is retained in the virion as part of the complex. Specifically, it is required for proper processing of GPC into the GP1 and GP2 subunits and modulation of the pH of infectivity, and it may have additional chaperone functions during GPC maturation (10–17). The GPC precursor is trafficked from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where it is heavily N-glycosylated and processed by cellular proteases [signal peptidase (SPase) SKI1/SP1] into its mature form, which comprises noncovalently linked GP1, GP2, and SSP (18). GPC must also interact with ERGIC-53 in the exocytic pathway in order to form infectious virions (19). The GPC trimer on the resulting virion must engage several host receptors to mediate entry of target cells. GPC of LASV binds to a xylose–glucaronic acid sugar, called matriglycan (20); on α-dystroglycan (α-DG) (21–23); or to alternative receptors at the cell surface (24). LASV then enters the endocytic pathway, where it binds to lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) before membrane fusion (9, 25, 26). The GPC of pathogenic New World arenaviruses binds to transferrin receptor 1 (27) as its cellular receptor. Multiple structures of individual GP1 and GP2 subunits of various arenaviruses have been determined (28–33), along with a GP1-GP2 complex of LCMV (34). That structure, however, did not reveal the organization of GPC on the arenavirus surface that is relevant for antibody neutralization and vaccine design. A study of more than 100 antibodies from human survivors of Lassa fever found that the majority of the neutralizing response to LASV targeted the quaternary assembly of the prefusion GPC trimer, rather than either subunit alone (7). Further, the majority of the neutralizing response was contained in a single competition group, termed GPC-B. Here, we present the 3.2-Å crystal structure of the prefusion GPC trimer of LASV, in complex with the human neutralizing antibody 37.7H, which is directed against the quaternary GPC-B epitope. This structure reveals the first look at the prefusion arenavirus GP trimer; suggests that conformational changes occur in the GP1 subunit, as well as the GP2 subunit upon exposure to low pH; and illuminates reasons why GPC must be enzymatically processed to oligomerize and bind one of its extracellular receptors. It also illuminates what appears to be the most vulnerable region on the LASV trimer targeted for antibody-mediated neutralization and suggests that such antibodies function by blocking conformational changes required for binding an intracellular receptor and for fusion. STRUCTURE DETERMINATION. Structure determination of an arenavirus GPC trimer has been previously hindered by metastability of the protein: the propensity of GP1 and GP2 to separate and for GP2 to spring into its postfusion, six-helix bundle conformation. Mindful of the success of cysteine-linkage strategies for HIV and Rous sarcoma virus (35–40), we genetically modified the LASV glycoprotein ectodomain by (i) making the point mutations R207C and G360C (41) to covalently link GP1 and GP2 together, (ii) introduction of a proline via an E329P mutation in the metastable region of HR1 of GP2, and (iii) by replacing the native S1P GP1-GP2 cleavage site with a furin site (RRLL to RRRR) to enable efficient processing of the GP in Drosophila S2 cells (fig. S1A). Among hundreds of modifications screened over 10 years, these three, in combination, provided stable, crystallizable protein. Size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and SDS– polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the resulting protein (termed GPCysR4) demonstrates that the GP elutes as a monomer and that the protein is efficiently processed into GP1 and GP2 subunits but that the two subunits remain associated (fig. S1, B and C). Further, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis with a panel of human antibodies demonstrates that GPCysR4 is recognized by neutralizing antibodies that require native association between the GP1 and GP2 subunits (7) and is not recognized by antibodies against post-fusion GP2 (fig. S1D). Together, these results suggest that GPCysR4 is in its native, prefusion state. Monomeric GPCysR4 was incubated with excess Fab 37.7H an",PMC,pos,1,pos,4534,pos_PMC,0.99504673,1

PURPOSE Perioperative management of infants with esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) is frequently based on surgeon experience and dogma rather than evidence-based guidelines. This study examines whether commonly perceived important aspects of practice affect outcome in a contemporary multi-institutional cohort of patients undergoing primary repair for the most common type of esophageal atresia anomaly, proximal EA with distal TEF. METHODS The Midwest Pediatric Surgery Consortium conducted a multicenter, retrospective study examining selected outcomes on infants diagnosed with proximal EA with distal TEF who underwent primary repair over a 5-year period (2009-2014), with a minimum 1-year follow up, across 11 centers. RESULTS 292 patients with proximal EA and distal TEF who underwent primary repair were reviewed. The overall mortality was 6% and was significantly associated with the presence of congenital heart disease (OR 4.82, p=0.005). Postoperative complications occurred in 181 (62%) infants, including: anastomotic stricture requiring intervention (n=127; 43%); anastomotic leak (n=54; 18%); recurrent fistula (n=15; 5%); vocal cord paralysis/paresis (n=14; 5%); and esophageal dehiscence (n=5; 2%). Placement of a transanastomotic tube was associated with an increase in esophageal stricture formation (OR 2.2, p=0.01). Acid suppression was not associated with altered rates of stricture, leak or pneumonia (all p>0.1). Placement of interposing prosthetic material between the esophageal and tracheal suture lines was associated with an increased leak rate (OR 4.7, p<0.001), but no difference in the incidence of recurrent fistula (p=0.3). Empiric postoperative antibiotics for >24h were used in 193 patients (66%) with no difference in rates of infection, shock or death when compared to antibiotic use ≤24h (all p>0.3). Hospital volume was not associated with postoperative complication rates (p>0.08). Routine postoperative esophagram obtained on day 5 resulted in no delayed/missed anastomotic leaks or a difference in anastomotic leak rate as compared to esophagrams obtained on day 7. CONCLUSION Morbidity after primary repair of proximal EA and distal TEF patients is substantial, and many common practices do not appear to reduce complications. Specifically, this large retrospective series does not support the use of prophylactic antibiotics beyond 24h and empiric acid suppression may not prevent complications. Use of a transanastomotic tube was associated with higher rates of stricture, and interposition of prosthetic material was associated with higher leak rates. Routine postoperative esophagram can be safely obtained on day 5 resulting in earlier initiation of oral feeds. STUDY TYPE Treatment study.

28644006,"Structure of the Forkhead Domain of FOXA2 Bound to a Complete DNA Consensus Site. INTRODUCTION. Forkhead box (FOX) proteins comprise a large family of transcription factors (TFs), members of which display functional diversity and participate in cellular processes ranging from development to immunity and metabolism. More than 170 FOX family members have been identified from different species and classified into 19 subfamilies (from FOXA to FOXS). FOXA, also known as hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3), was initially discovered as a key transcriptional regulator in the liver and many endoderm-derived tissues. Members of the FOXA subfamily can remodel nucleosomes and, as pioneer factors, facilitate DNA binding of other TFs. In mammals, the FOXA subfamily consists of FOXA1 (HNF3α), FOXA2 (HNF3β), and FOXA3 (HNF3γ). FOXA2 is a master regulator of gene expression in the liver, participating in liver-specific gene transcription and related physiological activities. This protein is essential for hepatic bile acid homeostasis and prevention of cholestatic liver injury. Recent evidence suggests that FOXA2 can affect the proliferation and invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells and act as a tumor suppressor gene in pancreatic cancer. FOX family proteins contain a relatively conserved DNA binding domain (DBD), known as the winged-helix or forkhead domain. The DBD of FOX is typically composed of three parts: three α-helices at the N-terminus, a three-stranded β-sheet, and two less-conserved winged loops at the C-terminus (wings 1 and 2). The main DNA recognition region is located on the third helix (H3), which binds DNA by inserting into the DNA major groove. The amino acid sequence of H3 exhibits high homology among all FOX family members. Most paralogous FOX proteins bind to the canonical DNA response element 5′-RYAAAYA-3′ (R = A or G, Y = C or T). Sequence divergence in the wing regions contributes to differences in DNA binding. The wing regions carry basic amino acids, which potentially recognize DNA structural features in the flanking regions of FOX binding sites, as previously observed for other transcription factor families. For forkhead proteins, a recent analysis of HT-SELEX data demonstrated that binding specificity predictions improve for models that augment nucleotide sequence with DNA shape features. In protein binding microarray experiments, forkhead proteins were shown to have the ability to specifically bind to alternate distinct DNA motifs. These findings merit structural studies that compare binding mechanisms of paralogous FOX transcription factors. The human full-length FOXA2 protein contains two transcription activation domains and a forkhead domain (Supplementary Figure S1A). Its DBD displays high sequence homology (95%) to FOXA1 and FOXA3 (Supplementary Figure S1B). The co-crystal structure of a FOXA3/DNA complex was previously reported, but the DNA used for crystallization contained a nonconsensus binding site. Genome-wide analysis of FOXA2-binding sites by ChIP-seq in human and mouse adult liver tissues suggested that FOXA2 binds to the consensus sequence (5′-GTAAACA-3′) of the FOX family. In this study, we determined the co-crystal structure of FOXA2-DBD bound to a 16-bp DNA containing a consensus site (5′-GTAAACA-3′). We compared our structure with previously solved FOXA3 and FOXO1 co-crystal structures, and employed biochemical analyses to study FOXA2 binding to different DNA sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. The coding region of human FOXA2-DBD (residues 157–258) was cloned in the pGEX-6P1 vector. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (GenScript, NanJing, China). Protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli Rosetta BL21 (DE3) cells and induced by 0.5 mM IPTG for 6 h at 297 K. Protein was purified by using glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) according to a standard protocol. The GST affinity tag was removed by PresScission cleavage overnight at 277 K. Protein was further purified by cation-exchange (Mono S 5/50GL, GE Healthcare) and size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare). Peak fractions were collected and concentrated to ~26 mg/mL. The final protein was stored in storage buffer (10 mM Hepes, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP, pH = 7.5) at 193 K. DUPLEX DNA PREPARATION. All DNAs were purchased from Genscript (NanJing, China) and purified as described previously. The DBE2 (Daf-16 family binding element 2) sequence contains strands 5′-TGCAAAATGTAAACAAGACT-3′ and 5′-AGTCTTGTTTACATTTTGCA-3′. The TTR (transthyretin) sequence contains strands 5′-TTGACTAAGTCAATCA-3′ and 5′-TGATTGACTTAGTCAA-3′. CRYSTALLIZATION, DATA COLLECTION, AND STRUCTURE DETERMINATION. The FOXA2-DNA complex was prepared by mixing purified FOXA2 protein and DNA at 1:1.2 molar ratio with the final protein concentration of 10 mg/mL. Crystals were initially screened with the Hampton Natrix Kit by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 291 K. Crystals were optimized by the hanging drop method at 291 K, by using a well solution of 80 mM Mg(OAc)2, 50 mM MES buffer, and 16–20% PEG4K (pH 6.5).

The modern life leads to excess consumption of food rich in fructose; however, the long-term changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism could lead to metabolic dysfunction in humans. The present study evaluated the in vitro insulin-mimetic action of p-chloro-diphenyl diselenide (p-ClPhSe)2. The second aim of this study was to investigate if (p-ClPhSe)2 reverses metabolic dysfunction induced by fructose load in Wistar rats. The insulin-mimetic action of (p-ClPhSe)2 at concentrations of 50 and 100 μM was determined in slices of rat skeletal muscle. (p-ClPhSe)2 at a concentration of 50 μM stimulated the glucose uptake by 40% in skeletal muscle. A dose-response curve revealed that (p-ClPhSe)2 at a dose of 25 mg/kg reduced (∼20%) glycemia in rats treated with fructose (5 g/kg, i.g.). The administration of fructose impaired the liver homeostasis and (p-ClPhSe)2 (25 mg/kg) protected against the increase (∼25%) in the G-6-Pase and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities and reduced the triglyceride content (∼25%) in the liver. (p-ClPhSe)2 regulated the liver homeostasis by stimulating hexokinase activity (∼27%), regulating the TCA cycle activity (increased the ATP and citrate synthase activity (∼15%)) and increasing the glycogen levels (∼67%).

28700665,"Solution conformations of Zika NS2B-NS3pro and its inhibition by natural products from edible plants. INTRODUCTION. Zika virus (ZIKV) was a neglected, mosquito-borne flavivirus because of its assumed small geographical spread and mild clinical symptoms [1] such as fever, headache, rashes and etc [2]. The first biological ZIKV sample was isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947 [3], and it was later found ZIKV is transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes. However since 2007, large epidemics of Asian genotype ZIKV have been reported around the world [4,5]. Recently it is estimated that one-third of the world population might be at risk of infection [6]. The rapid rise in ZIKA infection is compounded by the ease of vertical [7] and sexual human-to-human transmissions [8]. Recent studies have associated ZIKV infection with other diseases: Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly in newborn infants of mothers infected with ZIKV during pregnancy [7,9–11], thrombocytopenia [12], multiple-organ failures [13], and possibly male infertility [14]. Consequently WHO has declared a public health emergency for ZIKV infection [15]. ZIKV represents a significant challenge to the public health of the whole world but unfortunately there is no available effective vaccine or therapy so far. ZIKV has a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome of 10.7 kb, belongs to the flavivirus genus which also contains viruses causing dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis [6,16]. ZIKV shares a high degree of sequence and structural homology with other flaviviruses particularly dengue virus, thus resulting in immunological cross-reactivity [17]. Current Zika outbreaks are largely localized within dengue-endemic areas, it is thus proposed that preexisting dengue-induced antibodies may enhance Zika infection by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a factor that makes the vaccine approaches extremely challenging [17]. While several recent studies focused on the possibility of developing neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV [18–20], it may take quite a while before such neutralizing antibodies for ZIKV enter clinical trials. ZIKV genome is translated into a single ~3,500-residue polyprotein, which is further cleaved into 3 structural proteins and 7 non-structural proteins [16]. The correct processing of the polyprotein is essential for replication of all flaviviruses, which requires both host proteases and a viral NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) and this property makes the flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro a well-established target for developing antiviral drugs [16,21–32]. While there are studies testing the inhibition effects of certain drugs on NS2B-NS3pro such as bromocriptine [33], boronate [34], or small compounds inhibitors [35], we are interested in new chemical scaffolds that are found in the edible foods. Our focus here is on whether natural edible products contain small molecules that have some inhibitory effects on the enzymatic activities of ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro. Thus in the present study, we have characterized the solution conformations and catalysis of two enzymatically active Zika NS2B-NS3pro: one with NS2B and NS3pro linked by extensively used (Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)4 sequence; and another with NS2B and NS3pro unlinked. Subsequently, we identified several small molecular inhibitors from edible plants: five flavonoids and one natural phenol which were shown to inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro in a non-competitive mode. Further molecular docking suggests that these molecules inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro by binding to a pocket on the back of the active site and allosterically affect the structure-activity property of Zika NS2B-NS3pro. As such, identification of these natural product inhibitors here night provide new avenues for development of allosteric inhibitors against ZIKV infection. RESULTS. CLONING, EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION OF LINKED AND UNLINKED ZIKA NS2B-NS3PRO. Based on the sequence alignment with NS2B and NS3pro of the Dengue serotype 2 we previously characterized [21], the corresponding Zika sequences were identified for the NS2B (S1A Fig) and NS3pro (S1B Fig) of the Asian Zika strain 8375 (GenBank ID: KU501217.1). From synthetic genes with E. coli preferred codons, we amplified and subsequently cloned the DNA fragments into His-tagged expression vectors, which encode the isolated NS2B (48–100) with the transmembrane regions deleted (S1A Fig); as well as isolated NS3 (14–185) (S1B Fig). We also constructed a Zika protease with NS2B and NS3pro linked by a (Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)4 sequence which was extensively used for functional and structural characterization of flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes [23–27]. The linked NS2B-NS3pro protein was detected in the pellet of E. coli cells with induction of 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for four hours at 37°C, while a portion of recombinant protein was found to be in supernatant with induction of 0.2 mM IPTG overnight at 18°C. Consequently, we purified the linked NS2B-NS3pro by Ni2+-affinity column under two conditions: the soluble form directly from the supernatant under native condition, but the insoluble form from inclusion body under denaturing condition, which was easily refolded by overnight dialysis against PBS buffer (pH 7.4) with 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol (column 2 of S1C Fig). The linked complexes without His-tag were successfully obtained by cleavage with thrombin covalently linked to beads, followed by FPLC purifications on a gel filtration column (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200) (column 3 of S1C Fig). Nevertheless, the linked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes purified directly from supernatant and from the refolding were indistinguishable as judged from both enzymatic activity and biophysical characterizations by CD, fluorescence and NMR. On the other hand, the wild-type NS2B and NS3pro domain are not covalently linked. Furthermore, it has been previously demonstrated that only the unlinked Dengue NS2B-NS3pro manifested well-dispersed NMR spectra [30,31].

28722643,"Aural Rehabilitation for Older Adults with Hearing Loss: Impacts on Quality of Life-A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials. BACKGROUND Few systematic reviews have been conducted regarding aural rehabilitation for adults with hearing loss, with none specifically targeting the older adult population. With prevalence rates of hearing loss being highest in older adults, examining the effects of aural rehabilitation on this population is warranted. PURPOSE To evaluate the effects of aural rehabilitation on quality of life in an older adult population presenting with hearing loss. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Studies with adults presenting with hearing loss, ≥50 yr of age, with or without hearing aids, receiving interventions such as auditory training, speech-reading, communication strategies training, speech tracking, counseling, or a combination of approaches, and measuring outcomes related to quality of life, in an individual or group format, with or without significant others and with no limitations as to year of publication. STUDY SELECTION Searches in six databases, as well as results from hand-searching, gray literature, and cross-referencing of articles, yielded 386 articles. Of the 145 assessed as full-text articles for eligibility, 8 studies met inclusion criteria. STUDY APPRAISAL A component-based risk of bias assessment, as recommended by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS No effect sizes were found in group interventions measuring outcomes related to quality of life, such as mental and emotional functions, environmental factors, participation restrictions, and activity limitations. An intervention effect regarding participation was found for a self-administered home training program, but an effect size was unavailable. Small-to-medium effect sizes were found in one of two individual communication training programs, for which outcomes related to quality of life, such as emotional functions, activities, participation, and environmental factors were measured. The results of the component-based risk of bias assessment indicated that the quality of reporting was poor, thus compromising the internal validity of included primary studies. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that the combined body of evidence in support of aural rehabilitation for older adults with hearing loss is not sufficient to draw any firm conclusions. We identify a need for more rigorous research to guide clinical decision-making.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,4574,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0026939143,0
28732596,"Structural and Functional Insights into Human Re-initiation Complexes. After having translated short upstream open reading frames, ribosomes can re-initiate translation on the same mRNA. This process, referred to as re-initiation, controls the translation of a large fraction of mammalian cellular mRNAs, many of which are important in cancer. Key ribosomal binding proteins involved in re-initiation are the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2D (eIF2D) or the homologous complex of MCT-1/DENR. We determined the structures of these factors bound to the human 40S ribosomal subunit in complex with initiator tRNA positioned on an mRNA start codon in the P-site using a combination of cryoelectron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. The structures, supported by biochemical experiments, reveal how eIF2D emulates the function of several canonical translation initiation factors by using three independent, flexibly connected RNA binding domains to simultaneously monitor codon-anticodon interactions in the ribosomal P-site and position the initiator tRNA.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4575,pos_MEDLINE,0.997285,1
28740220,"The Tnfaip8-PE complex is a novel upstream effector in the anti-autophagic action of insulin. INTRODUCTION. Autophagy is a homeostatic intracellular degradation process involving formation of double-membrane vacuoles (i.e., autophagosomes) and degradation in lysosomes. Autophagy is stimulated during starvation, whereas it is inhibited by food intake. Defective hepatic autophagy underlies the hepatic insulin resistance observed in obesity and diabetes, which is normally regulated by insulin and/or amino acids. Physiological inhibition of hepatic autophagy by insulin is mediated by the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, leading to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation. Moreover, the Gαi3 subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein Gi3 is known to regulate enigmatic upstream crosstalk between the insulin receptor and PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling during the anti-autophagic action of insulin in the liver. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying non-canonical Gαi3-mediated signaling by insulin have not been fully elucidated. Although members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced protein 8 (Tnfaip8/TIPE/Oxi-α) family were originally described as regulators of tumorigenesis, inflammation and cell death, we previously discovered novel regulatory functions for these proteins in autophagy. For instance, Tnfaip8/TIPE/Oxi-α and Tnfaip8 l1/TIPE1/Oxi-β act as a pair of autophagy inhibitors and activators in Parkinson’s disease models. In particular, Tnfaip8 inhibits autophagy in an mTOR-dependent manner under oxidative stress conditions. In accordance with our findings, the Drosophila Tnfaip8 homolog CG4091/sigmar was also found to be involved in autophagy activity during salivary gland development. The crystal structures of Tnfaip8l2/TIPE2/Oxi-γ (hTIPE2) and Tnfaip8l3/TIPE3/Oxi-δ (hTIPE3), two members of the Tnfaip8 family, from Homo sapiens have been determined. The structures both showed a central hydrophobic cavity occupied by two long electrostatic densities predicted to be phospholipid in nature. In particular, TIPE3 was reported to promote tumorigenesis by transferring phospholipids as second messengers. However, the structural and molecular bases of Tnfaip8 in the process of autophagic inhibition remain to be elucidated. This is the first report to elucidate the novel structure and function of mTnfaip8-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as an upstream effector in the anti-autophagic action of insulin, which occurs via ternary complex formation with Gαi3. In this study, we show that insulin treatment induces a temporal increase in mTnfaip8. X-ray crystallography and LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) analyses reveal that mTnfaip8 is a novel PE-containing protein. Our findings demonstrate that the mTnfaip8-PE-Gαi3 ternary complex is essential for insulin-mediated anti-autophagy. RESULTS. TEMPORAL INDUCTION OF MTNFAIP8 BY INSULIN. Because mTnfaip8 and insulin are known to inhibit autophagy in neuronal and hepatic cells, respectively, we first investigated whether mTnfaip8 is regulated by insulin and acts as a potential effector molecule in the hepatic anti-autophagic action of insulin. The hepatic anti-autophagic activity of mTnfaip8 was first confirmed in a hepatic cell line as shown in Fig. 1a. When the temporal induction of mTnfaip8 by insulin was analyzed, insulin was found to induce an increase in mTnfaip8, with its increased levels of expression over 24 h (Fig. 1a). Moreover, this mTnfaip8 induction was accompanied by significant inhibition of autophagy, as demonstrated by a simultaneous decrease in the autophagy marker LC3 II (Fig. 1a). We next investigated whether PI3K-Akt signaling in anti-autophagic action of insulin is affected by mTnfaip8 gene knock down (KD) in either absence or presence of insulin. As expected, the levels of phospho-PI3K, phospho-Akt and phospho-mTOR were decreased significantly and the induction of autophagy was observed in both the absence and presence of insulin (Fig. 1b,c). These data suggest that mTnfaip8 may act as an upstream mediator of insulin-induced hepatic anti-autophagy via PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF MTNFAIP8 WITH A CENTRAL HYDROPHOBIC CAVITY. The crystal structure of Tnfaip8 from Mus musculus (mTnfaip8) was determined at 2.03 Å resolution (Table 1). Except for 12 flexible N-terminal residues (Met1-Ala12), all other amino acids are defined in the electron density map. The overall shape of mTnfaip8 resembles a water dipper. Its cylindrical domain has a dimension of 48 Å × 31 Å × 30 Å connected to an N-terminal grip-like domain composed of 20 residues with a length of ~35 Å (Fig. 2a). The overall structure of the cylindrical domain with a large central cavity is almost the same as that of hTIPE2 (PDB ID: 3F4M) and hTIPE3 (PDB ID: 4Q9V), indicating that the Tnfaip8 family shares a common structural motif (Fig. 3). The dimensions of the hydrophobic cavity are ~20 Å in depth and ~7 Å in diameter at the bottom up to ~10 Å at the entrance (Fig. 2b). The cavity is lined with highly conserved hydrophobic residues. Only a few prominently differing residues comprising the cavities are found among the three crystal structures. Leu109 of mTnfaip8 is substituted with Gly97 and Thr203 in hTIPE2 and hTIPE3, respectively. Leu51 of mTnfaip8 is replaced by Phe145 in hTIPE3 (Fig. S1). The volume of the cavity of mTnfaip8 is 837 Å3, and those of hTIPE2 and hTIPE3 are 822 Å3 and 805 Å3, respectively. Therefore, hydrophobic cofactors or substrates are expected to bind inside the cavity. Intriguingly, two long electron densities were found inside the cylindrical domain of mTnfaip8 (Fig. 2c). hTIPE2 and hTIPE3 also contain similar densities in the cavities of their cylindrical domains, as discussed below. In contrast, the electrostatic potentials of the outer surfaces of the Tnfaip8 family are degenerate (Fig. 4). Specially, a positively charged potential is prominently distributed from the surface of the grip-like domain straight down to the bottom of the cylindrical domain.

28763516,"Crystal structure of mimivirus uracil-DNA glycosylase. INTRODUCTION. Although uracil is a base component of RNA, it is occasionally introduced into DNA by hydrolytic deamination of cytosine [1]. Uracil generated by cytosine deamination causes a ‘G to A mutation’ in the complementary strand during DNA replication, which must be corrected to maintain genomic integrity [1]. Uracil in DNA can be repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway [2, 3]. In the BER pathway, uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) recognizes uracil which exists in DNA and creates an abasic site by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond between uracil and deoxyribose. Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease then removes the sugar-phosphate backbone of the abasic site. Finally, DNA polymerase adds a correct nucleotide to the site [2, 3]. UDG genes are found ubiquitously in cellular organisms from prokaryotes to humans, and have also been identified in some large DNA viruses, such as poxviruses and herpesviruses [2, 4, 5]. UDG proteins are classified into six families, based on characteristic motifs related to their substrate specificity and catalytic activity [6]. The family-I UDGs, called UNGs, are characterized by five conserved motifs that are arranged around the active site [7]. The motifs include the catalytic water-activating loop, the Pro-rich loop, the uracil-binding motif, the Gly-Ser loop, and the minor groove intercalation loop, corresponding to 143-GQDPYH-148, 165-PPPPS-169, 201-LLLN-204, 246-GS-247, and 268-HPSPLS-273 in human UNG1 (hUNG1), respectively [7–9]. Although UNG removes uracil included in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), it shows a preference for ssDNA than dsDNA as a substrate [10, 11]. The catalytic mechanism of UNG has been studied extensively through structural and biochemical analyses [12–16]. It is described as “pinch, push, plug, and pull”. In human UNG, the Pro-rich, Gly-Ser, and minor groove intercalation loops lead to DNA bending by compressing the DNA backbone (pinch). Next, a Leu residue in the minor groove intercalation loop penetrates into the DNA double helix (push), resulting in the base flipping of uracil, followed by uracil insertion into the binding pocket of the active site (plug). After removing uracil from DNA, the Leu in the minor groove intercalation loop is retracted (pull). The UNG gene in Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV) was identified recently by its genome sequencing [17]. APMV, which belongs to the Mimiviridae family of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV), is one of the largest known viruses, comparable to bacteria in size [18]. It has a large-sized virion (~750 nm) and harbors a complex genome (~1.2 Mb) that encodes approximately 1,000 putative genes. Some of these genes have been identified as core genes conserved among NCLDVs, whereas some are unique to cellular organisms and have never been identified in other viruses, blurring the boundary between cellular organisms and viruses [17, 19, 20]. Interestingly, APMV UNG (mvUNG) is longer than other known UNGs, suggesting that it contains domains or motifs in addition to the canonical catalytic domain. As a first step towards understanding of mvUNG, we determined its crystal structure and analyzed its enzymatic activity and thermal stability. The results suggested that the additional segments are required for mvUNG’s structural and functional integrity. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PLASMID PREPARATION, PROTEIN EXPRESSION, AND PURIFICATION. The gene encoding mvUNG (residues 1–370; GenBank accession number AAV50521.1) was synthesized artificially after codon optimization (Cosmo Genetech, Seoul, South Korea) and inserted into pET-22b (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) with DNA encoding His6x-thioredoxin. The plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21-star(DE3) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and the cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium. Protein expression was induced using 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside at 15°C. After overnight induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and clarified cell lysates were prepared in buffer A (20 mM hydroxyethyl piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.2 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine). The mvUNG protein was purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Proteins purified by IMAC were dialyzed twice in buffer A and then treated with thrombin to cleave the Hisx6-thioredoxin tag from mvUNG. After complete cleavage of the tag, the protein solution was passed through IMAC resin to remove His6x-thioredoxin. mvUNG was further purified using a Superdex-75 size exclusion column equilibrated with buffer A, followed by a Superdex-200 column equilibrated with buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.2 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine). Purified mvUNG was concentrated to 10 mg/mL and estimated to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. Mutant proteins (mvUNG95-370, mvUNG122-370, and mvUNGΔ327–343) were expressed and purified by the same procedure as that used for native mvUNG. CRYSTALLIZATION, DATA COLLECTION, AND STRUCTURE DETERMINATION. Crystallization of mvUNG was performed using the micro-batch method at 20°C. The crystallization drop was prepared by mixing 1 μL of protein solution (10 mg/mL) and 1 μL of crystallization solution (0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 25% (v/v) Polyethylene glycol 3350, 4% (v/v) Isopropanol, and 0.1 M CaCl2) under a layer of Al’s oil (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA). Needle-shaped crystals of mvUNG were fully grown in 2 months. Crystals were picked up using a cryo-loop (Hampton Research) and then flash-frozen in a cold nitrogen stream without the addition of a cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were collected at PLS-BL7A (Beam line 7A, Pohang Light Source, South Korea) and were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 software [21].

Dystroglycan (DG) is a heterodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein that is a part of the multimeric dystrophin–glycoprotein complex and plays a crucial role in the association of cells with the basement membranes 1. DG links the basal lamina with the cytoskeleton by bridging the intracellular dystrophin to a plethora of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, that is, laminin, agrin, and perlecan, thus offering stability to tissues. DG is highly expressed in skeletal muscle where it was first discovered 2 and where it confers structural stability to the sarcolemma during contraction, but it is also strongly expressed in heart, in brain, and in peripheral nerves, where it is involved in various physiological processes 3. Moreover, DG has been also associated with Old Word arenaviral infections, acting as a receptor for virus anchoring 4. Dystroglycan is encoded by a single gene (DAG1) 2 and the corresponding precursor is proteolytically cleaved within the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in the formation of the extracellular α‐dystroglycan (α‐DG) and the transmembrane β‐dystroglycan (β‐DG). In their mature forms, α‐ and β‐DG are linked together through noncovalent interactions involving the N‐terminal and the C‐terminal regions of β‐DG and α‐DG, respectively. α‐DG undergoes a complex, and is still not fully understood, glycosylation post‐translational process, which involves several enzymes at various stages of α‐DG maturation 5 in both endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. A correct α‐DG glycosylation has been shown to be critical for its physiological functions. In a family of neuromuscular diseases called secondary dystroglycanopathies, the hypoglycosylated forms of α‐DG, resulting from defective enzymes responsible for α‐DG glycosylation, display limited binding capabilities toward laminin with severe implications for health 6. A low degree of α‐DG glycosylation has also been found in rare diseases caused by single point mutations hitting the DG gene 7, 8, 9. In recent years, it has been discovered that the Ca2+‐dependent interaction of α‐DG with its main binding partner in ECM, the LG domain, is specifically mediated by a novel polysaccharide 10. The α‐DG glycosylation biosynthetic pathways involve a kinase and several glycosyltransferases 5, among which the bifunctional glycosyltransferase like‐acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE) that adds the repeating disaccharide unit (‐α3‐GlcA‐β3‐Xyl‐) to a glycan anchored at the site defined by Thr317 and Thr319 11. Indeed, it has been reported that the elongation of the glycan operated by LARGE requires the presence of the N‐terminal region of α‐DG (α‐DG‐Nt), which is thought to act as a recognition site for LARGE before being processed by a furin‐like proprotein convertase 12, 13. It has been proposed that α‐DG‐Nt would be able to bind other partners in the ECM 14, but the biological implications of these potential interactions remain elusive 15. We aimed at characterizing the biophysical and biochemical bases behind the biological function of α‐DG, and our efforts have been focused on the comprehension of the molecular determinants that modulate its binding abilities 16. An electron microscopy study showed that α‐DG assumes a dumbbell‐like shape, with two globular N‐terminal and C‐terminal regions at the extremes of a mucin‐like region 17. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the murine N‐terminal region disclosed a modular architecture composed by an immunoglobulin‐like (Ig‐like) domain and a second domain similar to the small subunit ribosomal protein S6 of Thermus thermophilus (S6 domain) 18. Although the experimental structure of the C‐terminal region of α‐DG is still unknown, homology modeling suggests that its fold is likely to be a second Ig‐like structure 19. According to the crystallographic structure, murine α‐DG‐Nt (mα‐DG‐Nt) assumes an overall rather compact fold, with the Ig‐like and S6 domains interacting with each other and linked together by a flexible loop 18. Such an organization has been observed in the crystal structure of the murine α‐DG missense pathological mutant T190M, which displays the same fold, mutual orientation, and interaction between the Ig‐like and S6 domains observed for WT α‐DG‐Nt 20. Despite such high degree of structural similarity, it has been proposed that T190M might have a reduced ability to assist LARGE in its glycan elongation action, and the resulting α‐DG hypoglycosylation leads to a form of limb‐girdle muscular dystrophy 7. The comparison of the WT and T190M crystallographic models ruled out any effect of the T190M mutation on the Ig‐like and S6 domains folding, as earlier proposed by a computational study 21. Therefore, we considered whether the murine crystallographic structure could be reliably used as a general structural model for α‐DG‐Nt. In addition, we have explored α‐DG‐Nt propensity for plasticity in solution by small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS) analysis of both murine and human proteins. The high‐resolution crystal structure of human α‐DG‐Nt (hα‐DG‐Nt) has also been determined, in order to assess the structural similarities between the two orthologs, which are 93% identical in their amino acid sequence.

28816945,"99mTc-pertechnetate-avid metastases from differentiated thyroid cancer are prone to benefit from 131I therapy: A prospective observational study. 1. INTRODUCTION. Differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) are typically iodine-avid and can be effectively treated with radioiodine (131I) when persistent/recurrent or metastatic disease are not amenable to surgery.[ In this context, a diagnostic 131I whole body scan (Dx-WBS) may be useful to detect iodine-avid metastases before 131I therapy, allowing a more precise selection of therapeutic candidate and appropriate activity of 131I. If metastases are detected in Dx-WBS, then the prescribed 131I activity can be increased to maximize therapeutic success at first 131I treatment.[. However, specialists who favor post-therapeutic 131I whole body scan (Rx-WBS) argue that scans performed after therapeutic activity of 131I administration are more sensitive for disease detection and avoid possible stunning of thyroid remnants and distant metastases from thyroid cancer.[ Until now the real mechanism of stunning effect has not been known. Some researchers also found molecular-level evidence that the stunning effect exists even at a low activity of 131I, which further hampered the use of Dx-WBS before 131I therapy.[ Rx-WBS possibly neglect sufficient radiation activity to metastatic lesions during the first course of 131I therapy since disease was not determined timely.[. 99mTc-pertechnetate has been widely applied to evaluate thyroid diseases because of its ideal imaging characteristics and favorable price and dosimetry. Pertechnetate-avid metastatic lesions from DTC have been described by several case reports.[ However, only 3 comparative studies with 131I can be retrieved, mainly focusing on the diagnostic efficiency of 99mTc-pertechnetate scan for thyroid remnant.[ To date, the value of 99mTc-pertechnetate scan (planar scan combined with SPECT/CT [single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography]) in the management of DTC patients has not been adequately assessed. The relationship between the therapeutic response to 131I and the avidity of metastatic lesions for 99mTc-pertechnetate is still unknown. Here, we therefore, designed a dedicated study to determine the contribution of neck and chest 99mTc-pertechnetate scan to the management of postoperative DTC patients with suspicious metastatic lesions. 2. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. 2.1. STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION. This study was approved by the ethics board of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital before its initiation (No. 2014-–0013). All participants were informed of details of the study with the information sheet and had signed the consent form prior to their inclusion in the study. We prospectively evaluated 184 consecutive patients with DTC who were considered to have suspicious metastatic disease after total or nearly total thyroidectomy (≥4 weeks) based on elevated stimulated serum thyroglobulin (ssTg) levels >10 ng/mL, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level >30 mIU/mL. All patients were confirmed with lymph node (LN) metastasis by the pathology of thyroidectomy. Patients with a history of malignant tumor other than DTC were excluded from the study. Thyroxine withdrawal and low-iodine diet for at least 4 week were required before blood samples were drawn and 131I administered. Serum TSH, Tg, and Tg-antibody levels were measured using a chemiluminescent immunoassay system (Immulite, Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA). Empirically fixed dose of 131I was given at 5.5 GBq for patients with local or suspected disease and 7.4 GBq for patients with distant metastases. All patients underwent neck and chest 99mTc-pertechnetate planar scan with SPECT/CT just before 131I administration or switch to reoperation. 2.2. IMAGING PROTOCOL AND IMAGE ANALYSES. 99mTc-pertechnetate planar scan in neck and chest was performed 15 min after intravenous injection of 99mTc-pertechnetate (370 MBq). The neck and chest SPECT/CT images were obtained using a hybrid SPECT/CT imaging system (Millennium VG and Hawkeye, GE Healthcare). The Rx-WBS and SPECT/CT were carried out 5 days after administration of 131I with the same technique equipped with a high-energy collimator. The detailed parameters have been described previously by our team.[. Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians, who were aware of the results of all relevant examinations, laboratory investigations, and imaging studies, evaluated the 99mTc-pertechnetate scans and came to an agreement by consensus. The Rx-WBS with SPECT/CT was reviewed by other 2 nuclear medicine physicians who did not know the previous pretreatment pertechnetate scans. Foci of radioactivity identified on planar imaging were further evaluated on SPECT/CT and classified according to their location and nature as positive scan, which was defined as anatomical finding from CT with increased radiotracer uptake higher than surrounding background excluding thyroid remnant or physiological distribution; equivocal scan, which included the following situations: abnormal anatomical localization from CT without unnatural increased radiotracer uptake or increased radiotracer uptake without corresponded anatomical finding from CT excluding thyroid remnant; and neither increased radiotracer uptake nor unnatural anatomical foci from CT excluding thyroid remnant were considered as negative scan. Concordant rate of per-patient and per-lesion basis was analyzed and the strength of agreement was obtained using unweighted kappa statistical analysis. 2.3. ASSESSMENT DURING FOLLOW-UP. Nearly 6 months after initial 131I therapy, patients who had 131I-avid foci in the post-therapeutic 131I scan received the second course of 131I treatment, and ssTg levels were also obtained. The ssTg before the first and second course of 131I treatment was marked as ssTg1 and ssTg2, respectively. The range of interval between ssTg1 and ssTg2 was 171 to 207 days (median: 187 days). The percentage changes in ssTg were calculated as (ssTg2 − ssTg1)/ssTg1.

Madanin-1 and chimadanin are two small cysteine-free thrombin inhibitors that facilitate blood feeding in the tick Haemaphysalis longicornis. Here, we report a post-translational modification-tyrosine sulfation-of these two proteins that is critical for potent anti-thrombotic and anticoagulant activity. Inhibitors produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells displayed heterogeneous sulfation of two tyrosine residues within each of the proteins. One-pot ligation-desulfurization chemistry enabled access to homogeneous samples of all possible sulfated variants of the proteins. Tyrosine sulfation of madanin-1 and chimadanin proved crucial for thrombin inhibitory activity, with the doubly sulfated variants three orders of magnitude more potent than the unmodified inhibitors. The three-dimensional structure of madanin-1 in complex with thrombin revealed a unique mode of inhibition, with the sulfated tyrosine residues binding to the basic exosite II of the protease. The importance of tyrosine sulfation within this family of thrombin inhibitors, together with their unique binding mode, paves the way for the development of anti-thrombotic drug leads based on these privileged scaffolds.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4601,pos_MEDLINE,0.9976311,1
2885355,"Effect of cetirizine, a new histamine H1 antagonist, on airway dynamics and responsiveness to inhaled histamine in mild asthma. Cetirizine, a major human metabolite of hydroxyzine, preserves the histamine H1-antagonist activity of the parent compound but poorly penetrates the blood-brain barrier, thus minimizing sedative and anticholinergic effects. In 10 young (mean age 27.7 years) subjects with mild asthma (FEV1 greater than 70% predicted), we evaluated the bronchodilator and protective efficacy of 5, 10, and 20 mg of cetirizine against bronchospasm induced by histamine inhalation (0.03 to 20 mg/ml) in comparison with placebo and hydroxyzine, 25 mg, using a random, double-blind crossover design. The provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% decline in FEV1 for all 10 subjects from the postdiluent control value was more than fourfold greater after each active drug than after placebo. Cetirizine, 5 to 20 mg, provided significantly greater protection against histamine-induced bronchospasm than hydroxyzine (p less than 0.001); moreover, a dose-dependent protective effect was noted with cetirizine. Significant bronchodilation was also found: at 60 minutes, FEV1 increased significantly after all active antihistamines compared to placebo and after 20 mg of cetirizine compared to hydroxyzine (p less than 0.05). FEV1 increased significantly at 120 minutes after hydroxyzine and after cetirizine in both the 20 and 10 mg doses compared to placebo (p less than 0.05). We conclude that in subjects with mild asthma, orally administered cetirizine provides significant dose-dependent protection against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, which in the doses studied is superior to that produced by the parent compound, hydroxyzine. In addition, cetirizine in 5 to 20 mg doses causes acute bronchodilation. These results suggest a possible role of cetirizine in asthma therapy.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,4607,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0037654138,0
28858528,"Phospho-Priming Confers Functionally Relevant Specificities for Rad53 Kinase Autophosphorylation. The vast majority of in vitro structural and functional studies of the activation mechanism of protein kinases use the kinase domain alone. Well-demonstrated effects of regulatory domains or allosteric factors are scarce for serine/threonine kinases. Here we use a site-specifically phosphorylated SCD1-FHA1-kinase three-domain construct of the serine/threonine kinase Rad53 to show the effect of phospho-priming, an in vivo regulatory mechanism, on the autophosphorylation intermediate and specificity. Unphosphorylated Rad53 is a flexible monomer in solution but is captured in an asymmetric enzyme:substrate complex in crystal with the two FHA domains separated from each other. Phospho-priming induces formation of a stable dimer via intermolecular pT-FHA binding in solution. Importantly, autophosphorylation of unprimed and phospho-primed Rad53 produced predominantly inactive pS350-Rad53 and active pT354-Rad53, respectively. The latter mechanism was also demonstrated in vivo. Our results show that, while Rad53 can display active conformations under various conditions, simulation of in vivo regulatory conditions confers functionally relevant autophosphorylation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4609,pos_MEDLINE,0.99731135,1
28867287,"Dynamic Control of X Chromosome Conformation and Repression by a Histone H4K20 Demethylase. SUMMARY. Chromatin modification and higher-order chromosome structure play key roles in gene regulation, but their functional interplay in controlling gene expression is elusive. We discovered the machinery and mechanism underlying the dynamic enrichment of histone modification H4K20me1 on hermaphrodite X chromosomes during C. elegans dosage compensation and demonstrated H4K20me1's pivotal role in regulating higher-order chromosome structure and X-chromosome-wide gene expression. Structure and activity of dosage-compensation-complex (DCC) subunit DPY-21 defined a Jumonji demethylase subfamily that converts H4K20me2 to H4K20me1 in worms and mammals. Selective inactivation of demethylase activity eliminated H4K20me1 enrichment in somatic cells, elevated X-linked gene expression, reduced X-chromosome compaction, and disrupted X-chromosome conformation by diminishing formation of topologically-associating domains (TADs). Unexpectedly, DPY−21 also associates with autosomes of germ cells in a DCC-independent manner to enrich H4K20me1 and trigger chromosome compaction. Our findings demonstrate the direct link between chromatin modification and higher-order chromosome structure in long-range regulation of gene expression. INTRODUCTION. Gene regulation in multicellular organisms entails diverse strategies that operate over different distances. Some mechanisms act locally on individual genes, while others act over long range to co-regulate expression of numerous genes within sub-chromosomal domains (e.g. imprinted gene clusters, hox clusters) (Andrey et al., 2013; Plasschaert and Bartolomei, 2014; Williamson et al., 2012), or across entire chromosomes (e.g. X-chromosome dosage compensation) (da Rocha and Heard, 2017; Kuroda et al., 2016; Meyer, 2010; Strome et al., 2014). Post-translational modifications of histones and three-dimensional chromosome architecture are prime elements of long-range gene regulation, but their functional interplay in controlling gene expression has been elusive (Dekker and Mirny, 2016; Soshnev et al., 2016). Here we dissect X-chromosome dosage compensation (DC) in C. elegans to determine the effect of chromatin modifications on higher-order chromosome structure during long-range gene regulation. DC is exemplary because it controls hundreds of genes simultaneously, it distinguishes X chromosomes from autosomes, and it discriminates between the sexes in modulating gene expression. The C. elegans dosage compensation complex (DCC), a ten subunit complex with five condensin subunits, binds to both hermaphrodite X chromosomes to reduce gene expression by half, thereby equalizing it with that of the single male X (Meyer, 2010). Moreover, the DCC remodels the topology of hermaphrodite X chromosomes into a spatial conformation distinct from that of autosomes or male X chromosomes by forming topologically associating domains (TADs) (Crane et al., 2015). During that process, the chromatin modification H4K20me1 becomes enriched on the dosage-compensated X chromosomes (Kramer et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2011; Vielle et al., 2012; Wells et al., 2012). Neither the role of this modification in chromosome-wide gene control nor its effect on X-chromosome structure has been determined. H4K20me1 is also enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, revealing a common feature of diverse DC strategies (Kohlmaier et al., 2004). Its contribution to transcriptional silencing is unknown. In general, the role of H4K20me1 in gene regulation has remained a puzzle due to its context-dependent contribution to both gene activation and gene repression (Beck et al., 2012). Although H4K20 methylation has been implicated in myriad nuclear functions including gene regulation, DNA replication and repair, mitotic chromosome condensation, and cell cycle control, the mechanisms that regulate different H4K20me states (H4K20me1/me2/me3) and transduce these states into properly executed nuclear functions are not well understood (Beck et al., 2012; Jorgensen et al., 2013; van Nuland and Gozani, 2016). In principle, H4K20me1 enrichment on C. elegans X chromosomes could occur by activating the methyltransferase (SET-1) that converts H4K20 to H4K20me1, by inhibiting the methyltransferase (SET−4) that converts H4K20me1 to H4K20me2/me3, by inhibiting the demethylase (JMJD−1.1/1.2) that converts H4K20me1 to H4K20, or by activating an unknown demethylase that converts H4K20me2 to H4K20me1. Although H4K20me2 is the predominant form of H4K20 in eukaryotic cells (Pesavento et al., 2008), only a neuron-specific H4K20me2 demethylase has been reported for any organism (Wang et al., 2015). No H4K20me2 demethylase has yet been identified that could regulate H4K20me1 levels during DC. We pursued the machinery and mechanisms that catalyze H4K20me1 enrichment on X chromosomes and the role of H4K20me1 in higher-order chromosome structure and gene regulation. The key element in controlling H4K20me1 levels is a DCC subunit. Apart from five condensin subunits (DPY−26, DPY−27, DPY−28, MIX−1, CAPG−1), the DCC includes an XX-specific protein (SDC−2) that triggers assembly of the DCC onto X chromosomes, two proteins (SDC−3 and DPY−30) that aid SDC−2 in recruiting the DCC to X, and two proteins (SDC−1 and DPY−21) required for full DCC activity but not assembly (Meyer, 2010). Through X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays, we found that DPY−21 defines a new subfamily of Jumonji C (JmjC) histone demethylases that converts H4K20me2 to H4K20me1 and is widely conserved from worms to mammals. Inactivation of JmjC activity in vivo abrogated H4K20me1 enrichment on X, reduced X-chromosome compaction, disrupted X-chromosome topology by weakening TAD boundaries, and elevated X-linked gene expression, demonstrating key roles for H4K20me1 in DC. Unexpectedly in germ cells, DPY−21 associates with autosomes, but not X chromosomes, in a DCC-independent manner to enrich H4K20me1 and facilitate chromosome compaction. Thus, DPY−21 is an adaptable chromatin",PMC,pos,1,pos,4610,pos_PMC,0.934455,1
28879231,"Homeodomain-like DNA binding proteins control the haploid-to-diploid transition in Dictyostelium. INTRODUCTION. Eukaryotic organisms have a wide variety of life cycles. Many are sexual, undergoing cycling between different ploidy levels, and even asexual species change their ploidy, although with less regularity (1, 2). Sexual life cycles are themselves highly diverse, because both haploid and diploid phases can be either proliferative or nonproliferative and unicellular or multicellular, and regular polyploidy is not uncommon (1). Within this diversity, some features are relatively common, if not universal. Because meiosis is conserved very widely across eukaryotic lineages, as are proteins involved in cellular and nuclear fusion, it is believed that these sexual processes, and the genes responsible for them, were already present in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes (3). The transition from the haploid to the diploid phase appears to have some features beyond the mechanics of membrane fusion that are potentially widely conserved: In diverse organisms, homeodomain proteins are required to trigger zygote function (4). First established in saccharomycete yeasts and then in basidiomycetes, this function of specific homeodomain-containing transcription factors has more recently been found to be present in green algae and land plants (5–10). Typically, two different homeodomain proteins are separately expressed in each gamete class so that, upon cell fusion, new heterodimers can be formed, enabling distinct DNA binding properties in haploid and diploid cells (6). Although the conservation of this feature of the haploid-to-diploid transition in fungi and plants suggests that it might be ancestral, zygote development in animals does not appear to be controlled in the same way, and it remains to be established whether this role of homeodomain proteins is conserved in the less well-studied eukaryotic lineages (4). Genes specifically involved in sexual processes tend to evolve rapidly, reflecting selection resulting from competition or antagonism between genes that underlie traits important during fertilization and sexual development (11–13). In some lineages, this evolutionary plasticity extends to the number of sexes (using this word in its broadest sense to include mating types): In ciliates, mycetozoan amoebae, and basidiomycete fungi, the number of mating types varies between species and is frequently greater than two (14–17). A number of factors are likely to affect the number of mating types in different populations (18), including the requirement to trigger zygote development (19). A new mating type must not only find and fuse with other types efficiently but also trigger the same zygotic response in all pairings, and it is possible that the mechanism used in some species might make the invasion of a new mating type impossible. However, the case of basidiomycetes mentioned above, in which many pairwise interactions between distinct homeodomain proteins can lead to correct zygote function, shows that this potential limitation is capable of being overcome. As mentioned earlier, these organisms often have more than two mating types and use homeobox genes in mating-type determination: Alleles of these genes must be different to trigger the zygotic response (7, 8). In cases where the number of mating types has reverted to two, an expanded mating-type locus includes two of these homeobox genes (17, 20, 21). The social amoebae, or dictyostelids, are another clade in which multiple sexes are common. Unlike haploid dictyostelid cells, zygotes feed cannibalistically on other amoebae of the same species, growing without cell division to form a dormant walled structure called a macrocyst (22). This large cell is thought to go through meiosis before haploid progeny resumes the mitotic cell cycle (15, 23). The most widely studied social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, has three mating types (24). Cells of any two mating types are able to fuse pairwise in a process dependent on a combination of cell-cell interactions and subsequently initiate zygotic development (25). The mating-type locus of this species encodes two pairs of gametologs that suffice to specify sexual compatibility: matA for type I, matS for type III, and both matB and matC for type II. The matA and matB genes are homologous, as are matC and matS, so type II appears to be a composite version of the other two mating types. However, although matB is genetically compatible with matS, and matA with matC, in specifying sexually compatible pairs, matB and matC are incompatible (24). We have suggested that the third mating type in this species arose after recombination between the two other versions of the mat locus, but it remains unclear how matA- and matS-like genes that ordinarily trigger sexual development when expressed in the same cell lost their compatibility to do so in the course of their evolution into matB and matC (15). None of the proteins encoded by these genes have recognizable sequence homology to known protein families or to any predicted domains. Furthermore, homologs are only detectable in closely related dictyostelid genomes, suggesting that these genes are rapidly evolving or that they represent novel sequences that arose recently (15). We have taken a structural approach to gain insight into the molecular functions of these apparently novel genes. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structures that we report here reveal that MatA and MatB each have a core helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif resembling a homeodomain, with largely flexible N- and C-terminal extensions, and we further show that the C-terminal tail is the main determinant of MatA versus MatB activity. We present evidence that these proteins are transcription factors with conserved roles, controlling the transition between the Dictyostelium haploid and diploid phases. RESULTS.

28888369,"Structure analysis of the membrane-bound dermcidin-derived peptide SSL-25 from human sweat. SSL-25 (SSLLEKGLDGAKKAVGGLGKLGKDA) is one of the shortest peptides present in human sweat and is produced after the proteolytic processing of the parent peptide dermcidin. Both peptides are reported to have antimicrobial function. To determine the structure of SSL-25 in lipid bilayers, a series of 19F-labeled SSL-25 analogs were synthesized. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis showed that SSL-25 and all of its analogs formed α-helices in the presence of lipid vesicles, thus allowing a detailed analysis via oriented CD and solid-state NMR. The results suggest that SSL-25 resides on the membrane surface with a slight helix tilt angle. A detailed 19F NMR analysis revealed that SSL-25 does not form a continuous helix. The α-helical structure of the N-terminal part of the peptide was preserved in membranes of different lipid compositions and at various peptide-to-lipid molar ratios, but the C-terminus was disordered and did not fold into a well-defined α-helical conformation. Furthermore, the NMR results showed that SSL-25 resides on the membrane surface and does not re-orient into the membrane in response to changes in either peptide concentration or membrane composition. SSL-25 does not aggregate and remains fully mobile within the membrane bilayer, as shown by 19F NMR. SSL-25 has a high binding affinity toward bilayers mimicking bacterial lipid compositions, but does not bind to mammalian model membranes containing cholesterol. These observations may explain the selectivity of this peptide for bacterial membranes, and they are also in line with basic biophysical considerations on spontaneous lipid curvature and the general effect of cholesterol on peptide/lipid interactions.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4618,pos_MEDLINE,0.99771726,1

OBJECTIVE To assess the role of transanal endoscopic operation (TEO) or transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) in rectourethral fistulas (RUF). RUF may appear after radical prostatectomy. Their treatment represents a challenge; many therapies have been proposed, from conservative to aggressive surgical approaches. Transanal endoscopic surgery (TEO or TEM) is a minimally invasive technique to access the site of the RUF to perform repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is an observational study with prospective data collection, conducted between September 2006 and December 2015. All patients were diagnosed with RUF following management of prostate cancer. Conservative treatment was administered in the form of urinary and fecal diversion with cystotomy and terminal colostomy, to achieve total urinary and fecal exclusion. If the fistula persisted, it was treated by TEO or TEM, with or without biological mesh interposition. If this failed, gracilis muscle was applied as salvage therapy. RESULTS Ten patients were diagnosed with RUF. In 1 patient (1 of 10), the fistula healed with bladder catheterization alone. In another patient (1 of 9), it resolved after total urinary and fecal exclusion. Eight patients underwent repair by TEO or TEM, 4 with biological mesh interposition; all 4 presented recurrence. In the other 4 patients treated via TEO or TEM, 2 had early recurrence, whereas the others had healed at follow-up visits after 4-6 months (2 of 8)-a success rate of 25%.

28945358,"Lysines in the RNA Polymerase II C-Terminal Domain Contribute to TAF15 Fibril Recruitment. INTRODUCTION. Recent studies linking self-assembly of FET protein LC domains to enhanced recruitment of RNA pol II CTD and heightened transcriptional activation highlight a pathological role for CTD interactions in FET fusion protein-mediated sarcomas and leukemias. Almost half of all fusion proteins associated with sarcomas contain a SYGQ-rich transcriptional activation domain derived from a FET LC domain. For example, the EWSR1-FLI1 chromosomal translocation is observed in at least 85% of Ewing’s sarcoma patients; the remaining 15% of cases exhibit EWSR1 or FUS fused to ERG or EWSR1 fused to a different ETS transcription factor family DNA binding domain (i.e., ETV1, FEV, ETV4). Efforts to recover normal gene expression in Ewing’s sarcoma family tumor (ESFT) cells, via suppression of EWS-FLI1 activated genes and ectopic reexpression of EWS-FLI1 repressed genes, impede tumor growth, suggesting that changes in transcription are the main drivers of pathogenesis. In addition to Ewing’s sarcoma, FET oncoproteins are implicated in varied subtypes of bone and soft tissue malignancies such as desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) and acute myeloid (AML) and lymphoblastic (ALL) leukemia, which share particularly poor prognoses due to frequent metastasis, relapse following childhood onset, and chemo-resistance. Importantly, because transcriptional activation domains of FET proteins are interchangeable in multiple sarcoma subtypes, FET LC domains are hypothesized to form similar interactions. One common feature of FET LC domains is their ability to drive self-association into liquid-liquid phase separated and amyloid-like assemblies. While it is hypothesized that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of FET proteins and other proteins with similar prion-like domains (hnRNPA2, TDP-43) seeds cytoplasmic inclusions in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the relationship between LLPS and fibrillar assemblies is poorly understood. Liquid-liquid phase separated FUS assemblies (i.e., “droplets”) convert into static circular assemblies within the nucleus of mammalian cells, and FUS droplets can convert into fibrillar aggregates in vitro. Conversely, separate studies suggest that cross-β sheet amyloid-like fibrillization of FET proteins may underlie LLPS assemblies or act as stable core structures that nucleate LLPS. While the structural conformations and molecular interactions of FET LC domains in the context of fusion proteins bound to chromatin are unknown, previously studied hydrogels composed of amyloid-like fibrils of recombinant mCherry-tagged FET LC domains provide a useful model for exploring molecular interactions between assemblies of FET LC domains and RNA pol II CTD. Indeed, the affinity of engineered FUS LC and TAF15 LC variants for wild-type hydrogels directly correlates with transcriptional activation. While we have previously shown that liquid-liquid phase separated FUS LC assemblies are sufficient for recruitment of RNA pol II CTD, here we sought to characterize the interaction of RNA pol II CTD with amyloid-like fibrils of recombinant TAF15 LC as a model for interactions between RNA polymerase II and oncogenic FET fusions. The human RNA pol II CTD is composed of 52 tandem heptad repeats with the consensus sequence Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7. Early NMR studies on an eight-consensus-repeat fragment of RNA pol II CTD suggested it adopts a unique conformation of overlapping β-turns, while circular dichroism studies of the same fragment and full-length murine CTD reported predominant disorder in equilibrium with polyproline II helices and β-turns. Recent work utilizing 13C direct-detect NMR and small angle X-ray scattering experiments to examine the effects of phosphorylation on the local and global structure of the Drosophila melanogaster CTD demonstrated that a twelve heptad, aspargine-rich section of RNA pol II CTD forms a compact random coil with individual heptads adopting structurally heterogeneous conformations. RNA pol II CTD heptad sequence degeneracies, a common feature of complex organisms, were shown to modulate proline isomerization and dephosphorylation, indicating diverse local heptad conformations can subtly tune interactions with regulatory factors. However the structure of the human CTD and specifically the lysine-rich region conserved in the last 26 heptads in mammals remains unexplored. Interestingly, recombinant FET LC fibrils more readily bind RNA pol II CTD’s degenerate lysine-rich repeat half (heptads 27-52, Figure 1A) than its tandem consensus repeat half (1-26), supporting a unique role for RNA pol II CTD’s degenerate repeats in transcriptional activation. Additionally, RNA pol II CTD binds mCherry-tagged TAF15 LC hydrogel fibrils with greater affinity than FUS LC hydrogels and TAF15 LC acts as a more potent activator than FUS LC, despite similar sequences distinguished primarily by TAF15 LC’s higher acidic residue content. This difference in transcriptional activation between FUS and TAF15 highlights an important question: how and to what extent do degenerate CTD residues (namely lysines, threonines, asparagines, and a single arginine) mediate interactions with assembled FET proteins? Here we use solution NMR spectroscopy and simulations to measure residue-specific secondary structure population of the intact degenerate repeat half of the human RNA pol II CTD (CTD27-52). We then probe the interaction of CTD with recombinant TAF15 LC domain hydrogels as a model for FET fusion protein transcriptional interactions with CTD during promoter recruitment and subsequent formation of the pre-initiation complex. In order to address the significance of CTD’s degeneracies we use solution NMR techniques (lifetime line broadening, dark state exchange saturation transfer) in combination with fluorescence localization and recovery after photobleaching experiments to probe interactions between CTD and TAF15 LC hydrogel",PMC,pos,1,pos,4633,pos_PMC,0.9966691,1

Outer membrane (OM) β-barrel proteins play important roles in importing nutrients, exporting wastes and conducting signals in Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts.

In Escherichia coli, the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) contains four lipoproteins such as BamB, BamC, BamD and BamE, and one OMP BamA, forming a 'top hat'-like structure. Structural and functional studies of the E. coli BAM machinery have revealed that the rotation of periplasmic ring may trigger the barrel β1C-β6C scissor-like movement that promote the unfolded OMP insertion without using ATP.

The periplasmic turns might mediate the rotation of the periplasmic ring to the scissor-like movement of BamA β1C-β6C, triggering the OMP insertion.

29110924,"Intramedullary elastic nailing of the displaced radial neck fractures in children. INTRODUCTION. Displaced radial head and neck fractures are rare injuries in children, with an incidence of 1–5% of all pediatric elbow fractures. The highest prevalence is between 9 and 12 ages, and fall on the outstretched arm with the elbow extended, which causes valgus compression over the radial head, is defined as the injury mechanism. The choice of the treatment depends on the degree of the radial head angulation, which mostly affects the long-term results. Then several classification systems based on the amount of displacement, angulation and the presence of the associated injuries, were introduced. Most of the related-literature, it is emphasized that for severe or moderate angulated fractures, reduction of the displaced head should be performed either conservative or surgical before casting.1, 4, 7, 8, 14 However reduction with hand manipulation is acceptable if only the stable construct is persistent. On the other hand, surgical techniques vary as percutaneous reduction with Kirschner wires, elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN) and open reduction with or without internal fixation.1, 5, 6. Open reduction is used only in communited fractures and cases where closed reduction has failed due to various disadvantages. Intramedullary technique which was first described by Métaizeau in 1980 and further developed to ESIN technique in 1993 by the same surgeon, allows extracapsular but intramedullary reduction and fixation without any need for pin removal surgery besides.7, 8. In this study we aimed to report the clinical and radiological results of 11 patients with Judet type 3 severely displaced radial neck fractures, who were treated with intramedullary elastic nailing and reduced with the help of percutaneous K-wire manipulation retrospectively (Métaizeau technique). MATERIAL AND METHODS. PATIENTS. A total of 11 children with Judet type 3 radial neck fractures treated as an inpatient in our department from February 2013 to August 2015 were included in the study. There were 4 boys and 7 girls with a mean age of 7.7 (range, 6–10 years). The fractures were on the left side in 8 patients and right side in 3 patients. All fractures were caused by falling onto outstretched arm from a height. One patient had associated supracondylar humerus fracture on the contralateral humerus and one had olecranon fracture on the ipsilateral ulna which were treated by open reduction internal fixation simultaneously. None of the study population had Monteggia like fractures. The fractures were evaluated according to Judet classification system.9, 10. - – Type 1: undisplaced or horizontal shift <3 mm. - – Type 2: angulation of radial head <30°, <50% translation. - – Type 3: angulation of radial head is between 30° and 60°, >50% translation. - – Type 4: more than 60° of epiphyseal tilt, with two groups, >100% translation 4a: tilt up to 80° 4b: tilt more than 80°. According to Judet classification, all patients had type 3 fractures with an average angulation of 50° (range, 45–57°). The angulation of the radial neck was measured as the angle between a line perpendicular to the articular surface of the radial head with a line drawn through the center of the radial shaft (Fig. 1). Also all fractures were epiphyseal some of which had transverse metaphyseal component (Salter Harris Type 1 and 2) (Table 1). Reduction of the displaced radial head was performed within the first 24 h after injury in all patients. All fractures were treated with elastic intramedullary nailing with the help of percutaneous K-wire reduction maneuver. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE. Under general anesthesia, using an image intensifier, an attempt for closed reduction was made by applying pressure on the lateral side of the extended elbow with longitudinal traction and varus stress. 2 cm skin incision was made along the lateral border of the distal radial physis. After blunt dissection, protecting the superficial branch of the radial nerve and superficial veins, a bone awl is penetrated the cortex 2 cm proximal to the physis and placed into the medullary canal of the radius. The nail was directed proximally toward the long axis of the bone by hammering upwards until it reached to the inferior aspect of the fracture, where the tilt was greatest. With gentle taps on the nail across the fracture and up to the subchondral bone, the fracture was disimpacted to allow better anchoring of the nail. Then a wire was introduced from the lateral to the fracture site by hand manipulation to create a lever arm effect on the fragment. With the help of the lever arm, the elastic intramedullary nail was turned around 180° which produced a medial shift of the radial head and reduced it (Fig. 2). After the reduction was achieved, the lower metaphyseal end of the nail was cut and the skin closed. A long-arm cast with the forearm in supination was applied for 2 weeks. The elbow is mobilized after the removal of the cast. The nail was removed at a mean time of 5 months (range, 3–8 months). FOLLOW-UP. All patients were evaluated clinically and radiologically at 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months postoperatively and thereafter 3-monthly intervals. The preoperative and postoperative clinical evaluation was performed by one of the authors (Y.E.) which included elbow passive and active range of motion (ROM), functional results using Mayo elbow performance score (MEPS); one of the most commonly physician-based elbow rating-system, fracture site healing radiologically and possible early or late complications. ROM was measured by goniometer. Follow-up radiographs included standard anteroposterior and lateral projections of the operated elbow. The reduction was considered excellent when it healed in the anatomical position, and good when the radial neck angle was less than 20°. Total MEPS ranges from 5 to 100 points which higher scores indicates better function. A total score between 90 and 100 points considered excellent; between 75 and 89 points, good; between 60 and 74 points; fa",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,4677,far_neg_PMC,0.0034631437,0
29114050,"Structure and function of yeast Atg20, a sorting nexin that facilitates autophagy induction. The Atg20 and Snx4/Atg24 proteins have been identified in a screen for mutants defective in a type of selective macroautophagy/autophagy. Both proteins are connected to the Atg1 kinase complex, which is involved in autophagy initiation, and bind phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate. Atg20 and Snx4 contain putative BAR domains, suggesting a possible role in membrane deformation, but they have been relatively uncharacterized. Here we demonstrate that, in addition to its function in selective autophagy, Atg20 plays a critical role in the efficient induction of nonselective autophagy. Atg20 is a dynamic posttranslationally modified protein that engages both structurally stable (PX and BAR) and intrinsically disordered domains for its function. In addition to its PX and BAR domains, Atg20 uses a third membrane-binding module, a membrane-inducible amphipathic helix present in a previously undescribed location in Atg20 within the putative BAR domain. Taken together, these findings yield insights into the molecular mechanism of the autophagy machinery.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4679,pos_MEDLINE,0.9974291,1
29127291,"Structural basis of arrestin-3 activation and signaling. INTRODUCTION. Arrestins modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling in two ways. First, arrestins bind to activated, phosphorylated receptor and sterically block G protein coupling, terminating G protein activation. Second, receptor-bound non-visual arrestins (arrestin-2 and -3, a.k.a. β-arrestin-1 and -2) initiate G protein-independent signaling via >100 proteins. This arrestin-mediated signaling regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. GPCR-dependent arrestin signaling occurs in the context of a complex between arrestin and phosphorylated, activated GPCR. In classic biochemical work on rhodopsin and arrestin-1, this arrestin–receptor interaction was found to rely on arrestin “sensors” that detect the phosphorylation and activation of the receptors. The phosphate sensor is formed by a group of positively charged side chains on the concave side of the N-domain that directly bind receptor-attached phosphates and is relatively unselective for the underlying sequence. The activation sensor distinguishes between active and inactive GPCRs. To our knowledge, neither the identity of the activation sensor nor how it recognizes >800 distinct GPCRs have been proposed. These phosphate and activation sensors are believed to act synergistically, as the simultaneous triggering of both sensors elicits the highest-affinity receptor binding. Structural studies in the context of biochemical work suggest that triggering the phosphate and activation sensors of arrestin promotes a conformational change. Structures of all four vertebrate arrestins in the basal state showed that arrestin is a two-domain protein with limited interaction between domains. Two inter-domain interactions have been suggested as key for stabilizing the basal conformation. The first is a group of buried charged side chains known as the “polar core”. The second is a sequence in the C-terminus of arrestin termed the “C-tail” (residues 385–393 of arrestin-3) that binds to the N-domain in a way that both contributes a charge to the polar core and blocks access to the phosphate sensor. Perturbation of either the polar core or the C-tail shifts the arrestin equilibrium to favor activation, suggesting that the inter-domain arrangement changes during activation. Recently, several strategies to stabilize active arrestin allowed structural characterization. These included the use of: (1) a more easily activated (termed “pre-activated”) splice variant of visual arrestin-1 called p44, which is truncated before the C-tail; (2) an antibody to stabilize arrestin-2 bound to a vasopressin receptor phosphopeptide; (3) the R175E mutant of arrestin-1 which has a destabilized polar core; and (4) arrestin-1 with activating mutations tethered to constitutively active rhodopsin. In the structures of p44, the phosphopeptide-bound arrestin-2, and the receptor-bound arrestin-1, a ~ 20° inter-domain rotation was observed, identifying inter-domain rotation as a hallmark of arrestin activation. In the R175E variant, a ~ 7.5° inter-domain rotation suggests that this structure represents an activation intermediate. Despite these advances, many fundamental questions in arrestin-mediated signaling remain unanswered. Non-visual arrestins bind >800 distinct GPCRs, yet it is not clear how this broad receptor specificity is achieved. It is also unclear how the phosphate and activation sensors elicit the inter-domain rotation that accompanies arrestin activation, or how the active arrestin conformation initiates signaling. Finally, the arrestin-3 isoform is uniquely able to signal independently of GPCRs. Previous studies identified that receptor-independent arrestin-3 activation biases signaling toward the activation of c-Jun N-terminal Kinase-3 (JNK3). However it is neither clear how arrestin-3 is activated in the absence of GPCRs nor are there compelling hypotheses for why receptor-independent arrestin-3 activation preferentially initiates the JNK3 signaling cascade. Indeed, it is not clear how arrestin activated by any input correctly directs signaling toward one out of >100 downstream effectors. To address these questions, we determined the 2.4 Å resolution crystal structure of arrestin-3 in complex with the non-receptor activator inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). We demonstrate that the same sensors critical for detecting the phosphorylated and activated state of GPCRs are triggered during receptor-independent activation, and reveal how the triggering of these sensors elicits inter-domain rearrangements. Moreover, we identify properties of the arrestin activation sensor that allow broad specificity for GPCRs. Finally, we propose a mechanism for arrestin-dependent signal initiation and bias. Collectively, these findings address many outstanding questions in the arrestin field. RESULTS. STRUCTURE OF IP6-ACTIVATED ARRESTIN-3. GPCR-independent arrestin-3 initiation of the JNK3 cascade is established in the literature. Although a physiological non-receptor activator of arrestin-3 has not been unambiguously identified, inositol phosphates and heparin have been suggested as possibilities. To test whether IP6 could activate arrestin-3, we determined the structure to 2.4 Å resolution (Fig. 1a; Table 1), which shows that the IP6-arrestin-3 complex is a trimer (Fig. 1a). In the structure, we identified electron density consistent with two bound IP6 molecules per arrestin (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b); each IP6 molecule is located between the protomers of the arrestin trimer (Fig. 1a). The structure shows that IP6 binds to arrestin-3 at the same location as C-tail in basal arrestin such that IP6 displaces the C-tail (Supplementary Fig. 1c). The IP6-bound structure exhibits an inter-domain twist of 17.7° with respect to the basal conformation (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the IP6 binding sites in the N-domain overlap with the binding sites for phosphorylated receptor (Fig. 1c, d). These observations are consistent with this structure representing activated arrestin-3. IP6 BINDING SU",PMC,pos,1,pos,4684,pos_PMC,0.9970421,1
29133225,"Longitudinal Evaluation of Chronic Rhinosinusitis Symptoms in a Population-Based Sample. INTRODUCTION. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory disorder defined by the presence of two or more cardinal symptoms (obstruction, drainage [anterior or posterior], smell loss, and facial pain or pressure) for at least 12 weeks duration, confirmed by objective evidence using sinus CT scan or nasal endoscopy. Epidemiologic studies in the US, using symptom criteria alone, reported a prevalence of 11.9%, similar to studies from Europe. CRS is a heterogeneous disease, presenting with a variety of symptom combinations. There is growing interest in examining whether certain symptom clusters are more or less likely to persist or progress, as such knowledge could aid in disease management. A dynamic chronic episodic disease model has been proposed for CRS. Chronic episodic diseases have periods of remission and relapse with longer symptom-free intervals, especially early in the disease course, but over time, as structural changes ensue (e.g., inflammation in sinuses or airways), symptoms can become less likely to remit and more likely to become progressively worse over time. Understanding symptom presentation over time is the first step in evaluating whether CRS evidences features of such a model. Conditions that follow this pattern, including asthma and migraine, reveal milder symptoms and more common remission of symptoms earlier in the disease course, and more persistent symptoms, often associated with structural changes, later in the disease course. There is some evidence for this pattern in CRS. Studies have reported that the longer the duration after CRS diagnosis to sinus surgery, the worse the respiratory conditions, antibiotic and steroid use, and CRS-related visits, postoperatively. Longer disease duration was also associated with the burden of symptoms and radiographic findings. However, the natural history of the early disease course has not been sufficiently studied. We describe here findings from a longitudinal general population-based study of nasal and sinus symptoms over six months using CRS criteria for epidemiologic studies from the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis (EPOS). Data from two questionnaires six months apart allowed us to identify six groups of patients based on EPOS CRS criteria at each time point: persistent, non-persistent, recurrent, stable past, incident, and never. For these patients representing the entire spectrum of nasal and sinus symptoms, we describe symptom profiles, report prevalence of these six longitudinal symptom subgroups in the source population, and identify predictors of these subgroups. METHODS. STUDY OVERVIEW. We mailed self-administered questionnaires to a stratified random sample of primary care patients of the Geisinger Clinic in approximately 40 counties of central and northeastern Pennsylvania in April 2014 and again in October 2014. Data was collected on the cardinal EPOS symptoms, other nasal and sinus symptoms, symptom frequency and severity, lower respiratory symptoms, comorbidities, and treatment. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Geisinger Health System. STUDY POPULATION AND SUBJECT SELECTION. Selection methods have been previously reported. In brief, a baseline questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 23,700 patients stratified by electronic health record (EHR) information into three groups (based on diagnostic codes for CRS, asthma or allergy, and none of these) and by race/ethnicity (Table E1, Online Repository). A total of 7847 persons returned the baseline questionnaire. A second questionnaire was mailed approximately six months later to 7801 baseline respondents. THE SIX MONTH FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONNAIRE. The follow-up questionnaire paralleled the baseline questionnaire but with additional questions that assessed the duration of symptoms, interim surgery, allergy symptoms, and lower respiratory symptoms over the prior six months. The 87 questions required 10–15 minutes to complete. The follow-up questionnaire was mailed in October 2014 with a return envelope and a $1 bill as an incentive, and resent to non-respondents in January 2015. IDENTIFICATION OF LONGITUDINAL SYMPTOM SUBGROUPS. CRS as defined by EPOS epidemiologic criteria requires at least two of four symptoms for at least three months duration, one of which must be either nasal obstruction or discharge. We used the EPOS epidemiologic criteria as this is the standard for study of CRS in large-scale epidemiologic studies. We defined three groups at baseline as those meeting criteria for current CRS (fulfilling EPOS criteria in the three months prior, with symptoms at least most of the time on a five level frequency scale [never, once in a while, some of the time, most of the time, all of the time]), past CRS (fulfilling EPOS criteria in lifetime but not current), and never CRS. The two questionnaires together allowed the identification of six symptom groups: (1) persistent, current CRS at baseline and follow-up; (2) non-persistent, current CRS at baseline but not follow-up; (3) recurrent, past CRS at baseline and current at follow-up; (4) stable past, past CRS at baseline and not current at follow-up; (5) incident, never CRS at baseline and current at follow-up; and (6) never, never CRS at baseline and not current at follow-up. DEFINITIONS OF PREDICTOR VARIABLES. All predictor variables were derived from the baseline questionnaire. Age of onset of nasal and sinus symptoms was evaluated in five categories (0–15, 16–30, 31–45, 46–60 and >60 years). Self-reported physician diagnosis of hay fever and asthma, a symptom-based definition for asthma, and migraine headache were created as previously reported. CRS treatment was measured for six different medications (antibiotics, oral and intranasal corticosteroids, oral and intranasal antihistamines, decongestants); these were evaluated alone (yes vs no) and as any of the treatments alone or in combination vs none.

Here we visualize more than 130 individual rRNA modifications in the three-dimensional structure of the human ribosome, explaining their structural and functional roles. In addition to a small number of universally conserved sites, we identify many eukaryote- or human-specific modifications and unique sites that form an extended shell in comparison to bacterial ribosomes, and which stabilize the RNA. Several of the modifications are associated with the binding sites of three ribosome-targeting antibiotics, or are associated with degenerate states in cancer, such as keto alkylations on nucleotide bases reminiscent of specialized ribosomes.

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of subclinical atherosclerosis. To explore the potential link of the serum vitamin D level with carotid atherosclerosis, this meta-analysis assessed the correlation between vitamin D and carotid intima-media thickness as well as carotid atherosclerotic plaque. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched until the end of March 2017. Clinical studies investigating the relationship between vitamin D and carotid atherosclerosis were included. The outcome data were extracted according to the inclusion criteria and pooled for an effect estimate by a random-effects model. Of the 506 initially retrieved studies, 11 studies involving a total of 16,434 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale scores suggested that the included studies were of high quality. The pooled effects estimate showed that the serum vitamin D level was negatively associated with carotid atherosclerosis (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-0.96), with substantial heterogeneity among the individual studies (I2 = 54%). Furthermore, a subgroup analysis suggested that hypovitaminosis D was associated with an 0.85-fold decrease in the odds of having a higher carotid intima-media thickness (95% CI, 0.76-0.96; P < .05; I2 = 69%). Additionally, the pooled analysis also indicated that the serum vitamin D level was a protective factor against increased carotid plaque (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.97; P < .05; I2 = 29%). Funnel plots and the Egger regression test showed the absence of a publication bias. In this meta-analysis, we comprehensively revealed a close link between vitamin D deficiency and carotid atherosclerosis.

KDM subfamily 6 enzymes KDM6A and KDM6B specifically catalyze demethylation of di- and trimethylated lysine on histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3/2) and play an important role in repression of developmental genes. Despite identical amino acid sequence in the immediate surroundings of H3K9me3/2 (ARKS), the enzymes do not catalyze demethylation of this general marker of repression. To address this question for KDM6B, we used computational methods to identify H3(17-33)-derived peptides with improved binding affinity that would allow co-crystallization with the catalytic core of human KDM6B (ccKDM6B). A total of five peptides were identified, and their IC50 values were determined in a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-based assay. Despite none of the peptides showing affinity significantly higher than that of the H3(17-33) peptide, it was possible to co-crystallize ccKDM6B with a H3(17-33)A21M peptide. This structure reveals the interactions between the KDM6B zinc binding domain and the H3(17-23) region. Although KDM6A and KDM6B differ in primary sequence, particularly in the H3L20 binding pocket of the zinc binding domains, where two histidines in KDM6A have been replaced by a glutamate and a tyrosine, they bind H3(17-23) in a very similar fashion. This structure shows that KDM6B, in analogy with KDM6A, also uses the zinc binding domain to achieve H3K27me3/me2 specificity.

29283500,"Identification of a novel nucleophosmin-interaction motif in the tumor suppressor p14arf. The tumor suppressor p14arf interacts, in response to oncogenic signals, with the p53 E3-ubiquitin ligase HDM2, thereby resulting in p53 stabilization and activation. In addition, it also exerts tumor-suppressive functions in p53-independent contexts. The activities of p14arf are regulated by the nucleolar chaperone nucleophosmin (NPM1), which controls its levels and cellular localization. In acute myeloid leukemia with mutations in the NPM1 gene, mutated NPM1 aberrantly translocates in the cytosol carrying with itself p14arf that is subsequently degraded, thus impairing the p14arf-HDM2-p53 axis. In this work we investigated the complex between these two proteins by means of NMR and other techniques. We identified a novel NPM1-interacting motif in the C-terminal region of p14arf, which corresponds to its predicted nucleolar localization signal. This motif recognizes a specific region of the NPM1 N-terminal domain and, upon binding, the two proteins form soluble high molecular weight complexes. By NMR, we identified critical residues on both proteins involved in the interaction. Collectively, our data provide a structural framework to rationalize the overall assembly of the p14arf-NPM1 supramolecular complexes.

29326501,"Analysis of Salivary IgA, Amylase, Lactoferrin, and Lysozyme Before and After Comprehensive Dental Treatment in Children: A Prospective Study. INTRODUCTION. Dental caries is an infectious multifactorial disease caused by interplay of tooth, diet, and microorganisms. The development of dental caries requires the presence of cariogenic bacteria and fermentable sugar to form acid leading to demineralization of enamel.[1] Cariogenic microorganisms enter the dental biofilm early in life and can subsequently emerge, under favorable environmental conditions, to cause disease. Occasionally, children with early childhood caries (ECC) have moderate levels of Streptococcus mutans, which are generally acquired from their mothers at an early age.[2] The various adaptive host defenses in response to these infections are expressed in saliva and gingival crevicular fluid in the oral cavity.[3]. Specific immune defense against S. mutans is considered to be one of the factors in altering the dental caries process. Protection is provided largely by SIgA antibodies which are generated by the mucosal immune system. The various nonspecific antimicrobial agents in saliva such as immunoglobulins, cystatins, lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, and lactoferrin have also shown an interactive effect on the reduction of bacterial growth and metabolism. The protective mechanism of saliva is necessary for the reduction and prevention of this infectious disease. Saliva has various protective functions due to its physical characteristics and chemical composition. The immune response in the oral cavity is due to the presence of an extensive and specialized mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.[4] Antimicrobial proteins in saliva constitute immunoglobulins and nonimmunoglobulins such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, mucins, histatins, and lactoperoxidase. Many of these molecules are present in rather low concentrations in the whole saliva, and it should be considered that their effects are cumulative and/or synergistic, resulting in an efficient molecular defense network of the oral cavity.[5] These salivary immunoglobulins include IgA, IgM, and IgG. Salivary IgA is the main immunoglobulin in saliva and provides the first line of defense against the pathogens. The decrease or absence of IgA or selective IgA deficiency is significant in immunodeficiency disorders and also has been associated with the occurrence of dental caries.[6] Salivary amylase was earlier considered as a starch digestive enzyme. Salivary alpha-amylase has been identified as a constituent of the acquired enamel pellicle[7] and may act as a receptor for bacterial adhesion to the tooth surface. The enzyme has also been found to interact with several species of oral streptococci, which are among the first to colonize dental plaque.[8] Lysozyme and lactoferrin are proteins produced by the major and minor salivary glands. They contribute to the maintenance of a stable oral ecosystem. These proteins can influence the development of dental biofilms, which inhibit mutans streptococci adherence and modulate planktonic bacterial aggregation to the biofilm.[9]. Diminished levels of salivary proteins have been found to act as a risk factor for the development of dental caries.[10] An antigenic challenge is known to increase the production of these proteins.[11] Oral research has focused on levels of salivary IgA, lysozyme, lactoferrin, and amylase in relation to dental caries. However, there has been no definite association reported between salivary proteins and caries biofilm.[91213]. Immunological basis of dental caries in children has not been extensively studied. There is a paucity of research in the evaluation of immunologic response of specific and nonspecific salivary proteins following complete oral rehabilitation. Furthermore, no studies have evaluated the association of both specific and nonspecific salivary proteins before and after 3 months of complete dental treatment in children. It was hypothesized that increased salivary protein levels would return to normal levels once dental disease is treated and oral health has been restored. Hence, the present study was undertaken to evaluate levels of specific and nonspecific immune defense salivary proteins, namely, IgA, amylase, lactoferrin, and lysozyme following comprehensive dental treatment in children with ECC. METHODOLOGY. The study was conducted in Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry. The study was approved by the institution's ethical review board. The study was carried out from March 2013 to August 2014. Eighty-five children between the age of 36–60 months who were visiting the dentist for the first time were screened in the department. Of these, thirty healthy, cooperative children aged between 36 and 60 months, with only primary dentition with fair oral hygiene and having deft scores >5, were selected for the study. Children having an abscess due to dental caries, children with salivary gland disorders, those with special health care needs, recent exposures to antibiotics (last 3 months), poor oral hygiene, presence of periodontal disease, and children who were chronic mouth breathers were excluded from participating in the study. Before conducting the study, written consent was obtained from the parents or caretakers of children. Oral examination was performed by a single calibrated examiner using dental mouth mirror and explorer under artificial illumination. WHO criteria (2013) for caries lesions were used to diagnose and record dental caries. Before the start of dental treatment, stimulated whole saliva was collected from each child. The saliva collection was done between 10 AM and 11:30 AM for all the children. It was ensured that the child did not eat or drink anything for 1 h before saliva collection. Each child was instructed to sit motionless and upright and was asked to chew a paraffin wax block of 1 cm diameter for 1 min.[14] The initial pooled saliva was discarded. The child was made to chew on the paraffin wax for an additional 5 min and was told to spit out the pooled saliva into a collecting funnel placed in a sterile graduat",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,4740,far_neg_PMC,0.0034631437,0
2933134,"Trypsin digestion of bovine cardiac troponin C in the presence and absence of calcium. The rate of tryptic digestion of cardiac troponin C (cTNC) has been shown to be dependent on Ca2+ as was noted earlier for skeletal TNC (sTNC). Two representative peptides have been characterized on the basis of amino acid composition and partial amino terminal sequence analysis. Circular dichroism and fluorescence studies monitored their response to the presence of Ca2+. Their ability to form complexes with the ATPase inhibitory subunit of cardiac troponin (cTNI) was determined by urea - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorescence experiments. The ability of these peptides to substitute for whole cTNC in restoring the ATPase activity of a partially inhibited synthetic actomyosin system was also explored. The N-terminal peptide 1-88 already contains a large amount of ordered structure, which indicates that the alpha-helices flanking binding site II of cTNC exist independently of Ca2+. Consequently this peptide shows limited increase in structure in the presence of Ca2+. It binds to cTNI independently of the presence of Ca2+ and could substitute for whole cTNC by relaxing the inhibitory effect of cTNI. The C-terminal peptide 103-158 has a low amount of secondary structure in the absence of Ca2+ but this increases dramatically in the presence of this cation. This peptide could only form a stable complex with cTNI in the presence of Ca2+ and was unable to release the inhibitory effect of cTNI.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4742,pos_MEDLINE,0.98768765,1
29372459,"1H, 13C, 15N resonance assignment of human YAP 50-171 fragment. BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT. Yes associated protein (YAP) is an partly intrinsically disordered protein transcribed into four different isoforms ranging from 326 to 504 residues (Santucci et al. 2015). YAP is a major target and a terminal effector of the Hippo pathway, important for the regulation of organ size (Zhao et al. 2011) and is associated with cancer development (Liu et al. 2012; Pobbati and Hong 2013; Ma et al. 2015; Pobbati et al. 2015). One of the functions of YAP is to bind to the TEAD transcription factors as a transcriptional coactivator. Therefore, the YAP:TEAD interaction might be a promising therapeutic approach in cancers where the Hippo pathway is deregulated. The formation of the YAP:TEAD complex is indirectly regulated by YAP phosphorylation, which prohibits nuclear translocation of YAP and leads to downregulation of genes related to proliferation; therefore, leading to apoptosis (Zhao et al. 2007). Previously, the binding between YAP and TEAD was studied and the protein region 50–171 was identified as the TEAD binding domain (Vassilev et al. 2001) Furthermore, three binding interfaces were identified between YAP and TEAD (Li et al. 2010). Namely, a β-strand (residues 52–58), an α-helix (residues 61–73), and an Ω-loop (residues 86–100). Furthermore, key residues in the binding site and their contribution to the binding have been described (Mesrouze et al. 2017). In order to gain further insights into the binding process and structural features of the bound and unbound state, we present a chemical shift assignment of YAP 50–171. METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS. SAMPLE PREPARATION. The sequence coding for YAP residues 50–171 was amplified by PCR and cloned into a pETM14 vector by sequence and ligation independent cloning (SLIC) (Scholz et al. 2013). The plasmid, containing the fusion protein with a His6-tag at the N-terminus and a 3C protease cleavage site, was transformed into Escherichia coli Tuner™(DE3). Four liters of LB medium were inoculated with the overnight culture and incubated at 37 °C until an OD600 of 0.8. Cells were centrifuged and all pellets were combined and resuspended in one liter of M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/L 15N ammonium chloride (Sigma Aldrich) and 3 g/L 13C glucose (Cambridge Isotope) as the sole source of nitrogen and carbon, respectively (Marley et al. 2001). After an additional hour at 37 °C, expression was induced with the addition of 0.8 mM IPTG and cells were incubated for 18 h at 30 °C and consecutively harvested by centrifugation and stored at − 20 °C. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM Imidazole, pH 7.8), supplemented with 50 µL of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific), and lysed by sonication on ice. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation and supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap FF column and washed with 8 column volumes of wash buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 40 mM Imidazole, pH 7.8). After eluting with 15 ml of elution buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 300 mM Imidazole, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.8), the eluate was concentrated to 2 ml and dialyzed overnight against an excess of NMR buffer (20 mM BisTris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.0). Consequently, His6-tag was removed by 3C protease cleavage overnight at 4 °C. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1 M and the solution was heated to 90 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/600 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion column equilibrated with NMR buffer. Purified protein, which was > 95% pure as assessed by SDS/PAGE, was concentrated to approximately 0.5 mM in NMR buffer containing 10% D2O as determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific). NMR SPECTROSCOPY. NMR experiments were performed at 298 K using a Bruker Avance III 800 MHz spectrometer. The backbone assignments were obtained using BEST-TROSY type versions of HNCANNH, HN(COCA)NNH, HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO experiments (Solyom et al. 2013). Data was processed with NMRPipe (Delaglio et al. 1995) and spectra were assigned using CcpNmr (Vranken et al. 2005) and Sparky (Goddard and Kneller 2004). ASSIGNMENTS AND DATA DEPOSITION. Assignment of the backbone amides 1H, 15N of YAP 50–171 is shown in Fig. 1. Backbone amide resonances were assigned for all of 108 non-proline residues, except of K76, K90, K97, K102, H104, and H126. Therefore, 12% of the total 1H resonances of the protein were assigned. In addition, 94% of Cα and Cβ resonances of the respective residues and 81% of C’ resonances were assigned. The very narrow peak dispersion in the 1H dimension of the 1H–15N HSQC spectrum shows that YAP 50–171 is intrinsically disordered. Nevertheless, the secondary structure propensity (SSP) score (Marsh et al. 2006) clearly indicates a propensity for a preformation of the α-helix and the N-terminal β-strand in the unbound state (Fig. 2a). The protein region of the Ω-loop shows no exceptional SSP scores. Furthermore, the protein seems to preferentially adopt extended structures (negative SSP scores).

They feature a combination of the unique properties of fractional diffraction effects, surface waves and gap solitons. The instability of solitons can be remarkably suppressed by the decrease of Lévy index, especially obvious for solitons in the second gaps.

29410458,"Heme interaction of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal peptide segment of human cystathionine-β-synthase. INTRODUCTION. Cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) is a modular enzymatic protein of 551 amino acids. The lyase CBS acts in the transsulfuration pathway and has a central role in the mammalian sulfur metabolism by catalysing the condensation of serine and homocysteine to a cystathionine intermediate. Mutations in CBS are responsible for an inborn autosomal recessive inherited deviation in the amino acid metabolism, homocystinuria. This rare disease results in a clinical phenotype with elevated levels of homocysteine in blood plasma affecting four central organ systems, the cardiovascular, ocular, skeletal, and central nervous system and finally manifesting e.g. in neural tube defects, cardiovascular diseases and Alzheimer’s disease. Currently, more than 150 pathogenic CBS mutations have been reported which are spread across the coding sequence. CBS is a heme-binding protein and represents an example for a human hemoprotein that can be regulated by gases via their heme component. Especially, besides its binding CO and NO, CBS is involved in cellular production of major amounts of the gasotransmitter H2S. It was shown that aberrant function of CBS may thus lead to cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases making it an interesting drug target. The homotetrameric CBS, a member of the fold type II family of the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, is in large parts structurally well characterised. Members of this enzyme family are of multiple evolutionary origins. CBS contains the N-terminal heme-binding domain followed by catalytic core, which is conserved in most proteins of this class of organisms, and a C-terminal regulatory domain. The N-terminal domain (residues 1–70) is sequentially diverse in many classes of organisms and absent in lower eukaryotes like yeast and mycobacterium. The canonical heme in CBS is bound via an axial coordination to cysteine-52 and histidine-65 in the N-terminal region of the molecule. Interestingly, this binding site is missing in the homologous yeast enzyme. In contrast to covalent binding of heme, recent studies have shown that transient interactions of the heme moiety with proteins can act as functional triggers. Here, heme-binding motifs (HBM) or heme regulatory motifs (HRM) with special amino acid combinations –among them the cysteine-proline (CP) motif– are suggested to be responsible for heme association. However, due to moderate binding constants these motifs at the same time allow also a fast dissociation of the heme complex. Interestingly, also in the newest X-ray structures of the human CBS protein (e.g. PDB code 4COO) the stretch from residue 516–526 and the first 42 N-terminal residues are missing. Exactly in the latter region a CP-motif is located which is followed by histidines at positions P + 2 and P + 7 relative to the cysteine. This region is structurally close to the canonical heme-binding site at Cys52/His65 which allows to speculate about a scavenger-type function of the CP-motif located in this intrinsically disordered protein region to support the localisation of the heme molecule during the binding process or to act as a second independent heme-binding site. In addition, it might be of interest to note that a sequence homology analysis reveals this CPH-motif to be conserved in higher eukaryotes with secondary interacting amino acid (H, C, Y) present in vicinity (Fig. 1). Intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) are increasingly recognised to have functional relevance for biological regulatory processes in e.g. cellular signal transduction, molecular recognition and transcription making them an interesting target for drug intervention. Bioinformatic predictions (e.g. with DISOPRED2) estimate that disordered regions or segments longer than 30 residues are present in approx. 2.0% of archaean, 4.2% of eubacterial and 33.0% of eukaryotic proteins and that IDPRs are highly abundant in disease-related proteins. Meanwhile the aim to structurally characterise IDPRs has fostered the development of various approaches e.g. in the areas of computational prediction as well as NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, CP-motifs are also found in intrinsically disordered regions of functional relevance in other proteins that are associated with heme binding. In this context, we have expressed the CBS protein using established approaches and investigated the heme-binding domain separately from the catalytic core. Functional studies on CBS(1–413) and on mutations of the non-canonical heme-binding site (C15S) were performed to compare and analyse the heme-binding process in CBS. NMR spectroscopy was also employed to characterise the heme interaction exploiting the advantage of this technique to describe also intrinsically disordered regions at atomic level. RESULTS. PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. The recombinant CBS(1–413) and the CBS(1–413)C15S mutant were expressed and purified as per literature. The N-terminal CBS peptide (GB1CBS(1–40)), consisting of the residues 1–40 of CBS (MPSETPQAEVGPTGCPHRSGPHSAKGSLEKGSPEDKEAKE), was expressed as fusion to the B1 domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1). UV/VIS STUDY. UV/Vis spectroscopy was employed to monitor the interaction of the proteins with heme. UV/Vis data shows the heme binding by a Soret band shift to ~421 nm (Fig. 2a). Previous studies on heme binding to peptides using UV/Vis, Raman, EPR and NMR spectroscopy revealed that a UV shift to ~420 nm may be related to a hexacoordinated complex. Thus, this bathochromic effect is characteristic of heme binding and suggests formation of a hexacoordinated state which in CBS involves residues cysteine-15 and histidine-22. The KD value was determined to be 2.18 ± 0.64 μM. According to the best fit possible GB1CBS(1–40) binds to heme with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 2b). ENZYME ACTIVITY ASSAY.

29432148,"15N detection harnesses the slow relaxation property of nitrogen: Delivering enhanced resolution for intrinsically disordered proteins. Studies over the past decade have highlighted the functional significance of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Due to conformational heterogeneity and inherent dynamics, structural studies of IDPs have relied mostly on NMR spectroscopy, despite IDPs having characteristics that make them challenging to study using traditional 1H-detected biomolecular NMR techniques. Here, we develop a suite of 3D 15N-detected experiments that take advantage of the slower transverse relaxation property of 15N nuclei, the associated narrower linewidth, and the greater chemical shift dispersion compared with those of 1H and 13C resonances. The six 3D experiments described here start with aliphatic 1H magnetization to take advantage of its higher initial polarization, and are broadly applicable for backbone assignment of proteins that are disordered, dynamic, or have unfavorable amide proton exchange rates. Using these experiments, backbone resonance assignments were completed for the unstructured regulatory domain (residues 131-294) of the human transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATC2), which includes 28 proline residues located in functionally important serine-proline (SP) repeats. The complete assignment of the NFATC2 regulatory domain enabled us to study phosphorylation of NFAT by kinase PKA and phosphorylation-dependent binding of chaperone protein 14-3-3 to NFAT, providing mechanistic insight on how 14-3-3 regulates NFAT nuclear translocation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4772,pos_MEDLINE,0.99565166,1
29458712,"Implications of being born late in the active season for growth, fattening, torpor use, winter survival and fecundity. INTRODUCTION. Because of limited food resources in the environment, organisms have to optimize the allocation of energy to the competing processes of self-maintenance, growth and reproduction to maximize their fitness. In seasonal environments, animals often have to face periods of food shortage and thus trade-offs of energy allocation. In response to these challenges animals may employ diverse strategies to cope with unfavourable conditions. These include migration, energy storage or the use of hypometabolic states. In particular, many small mammals and birds have developed specific mechanisms of energy and water conservation, achieved by active and controlled reductions of metabolic rate (‘MR’) and hence body temperature (‘Tb’) that is, daily torpor or hibernation (Geiser and Ruf, 1995; Heldmaier and Ruf, 1992; Ruf and Geiser, 2015). Since most hibernators do not eat during their hibernation season but use body fat reserves as primary fuel, gaining sufficient body fat depots prior to hibernation is an important process for overwintering survival (Dark, 2005). This is especially true for juveniles due to their low body size, hence low ability to store fat (Bertolino et al., 2001; Dark, 2005). As a consequence, pre-hibernation body mass – a proxy for fat mass (‘FM’) – is a good predictor of winter survival and thus fitness (Armitage et al., 1976; Dark, 2005; Lenihan et al., 1996; Murie and Boag, 1984). Besides fat deposition, body size, and consequently growth, is a crucial determinant of fitness and a major component of life history because it can negatively affect future survival and reproduction, namely the ‘silver-spoon effect’ (Arendt, 1997; Dmitriew, 2011; Metcalfe and Monaghan, 2001, 2003). Indeed, suboptimal, delayed or even accelerated growth can impair the somatic status and/or the reproductive output, and thus the fitness of individuals (Metcalfe and Monaghan, 2003). Therefore, investing enough resources in the energy-demanding processes of postnatal growth and pre-hibernation fattening is of high relevance for juvenile hibernators. This can, however, represent a challenge, notably when the time before hibernation onset is shortened, as for juveniles born late in the reproductive season. Further, food availability during key periods of development might also be reduced (Metcalfe and Monaghan, 2001), as it can happen late in the reproductive season. Therefore, being a hibernator born late in the summer might trigger coordinated energy-sparing strategies for FM gain at the expense of body growth and subsequent reproductive success. One of the common responses shown by late-born (‘LB’) individuals is to grow and gain mass at higher-than-normal rates. This is indeed the case in LB garden dormice (Eliomys quercinus) that grow almost twice as fast as early-born (‘EB’) individuals, reaching lower fat content prior to hibernation (Stumpfel et al., 2017). One possible strategy to lower energy requirements and to minimize the impact of energetic challenges is the use of short torpor bouts during certain parts of the day, namely daily torpor (Ruf et al., 1991). In particular, torpor use is thought to sustain and promote growth, body mass gain and pre-hibernation fattening and may ensure survival in young individuals (Geiser and Brigham, 2012; Geiser et al., 2006; Giroud et al., 2012; Giroud et al., 2014). Previous studies of our group have demonstrated that LB juvenile garden dormice use daily torpor to counteract intermittent periods of fasting, showing similar trajectories of body mass gain as ad libitum-fed individuals prior to hibernation (Giroud et al., 2012; Giroud et al., 2014). However, we presently know very little about the use of daily torpor in juvenile hibernators (Geiser, 2008; Geiser and Brigham, 2012). Further, to our knowledge no study so far has specifically investigated the effect of torpor and alternative energy-saving strategies on processes of growth and pre-hibernation fattening in hibernators according to their time of birth within the season. The garden dormouse, henceforth 'dormouse', is a small nocturnal and omnivorous rodent endemic to Europe (Bertolino et al., 2008; Vaterlaus-Schlegel, 1997; Vogel, 1997). The hibernation season, during which they solely rely on body energy reserves accumulated prior to hibernation, can last up to 7 months (Bertolino et al., 2001). Because a second litter late in the season is possible, both in captivity and in the field (Giroud et al., 2012; Giroud et al., 2014; Moreno, 1988), dormice provide an excellent model to determine differences between juveniles from EB and LB litters. In the present study, we therefore investigated the effects of the time of birth (EB vs. LB) and food availability (ad-libitum ‘AL’ vs. intermittently fasted ‘IF’) on (i) the rate of growth and pre-hibernation fattening, (ii) the use of energy saving strategies such as daily torpor, (iii) the body size and body fat content prior to hibernation, (iv) the subsequent overwinter hibernating patterns and mass losses, and (v) the fecundity at the following spring of female juvenile dormice. Specifically, we hypothesized that LB juvenile dormice (i) grow and fatten at higher rates, due to (ii) a higher use of torpor, and (iii) reach similar pre-hibernation levels of body size but a lower body fat content, leading to (iv) differences in hibernating patterns and mass losses overwinter, compared to EB individuals. Further, we expected IF juveniles to employ more often and longer torpor bouts than AL fed individuals to reach similar levels of body fat content prior to hibernation. Finally, because of higher growth rates, we expected (v) LB juveniles to show a lower level of fecundity than EB individuals, at the subsequent reproductive season. RESULTS.

Background Here, we report the mid-term results of endovascular treatment of isolated dissection of the abdominal aorta, which is a very rare pathology. Materials and methods A total of 11 patients (4 males (36.3%) and 7 females (63.6%)) aged 42-72 (mean, 60.3 ± 10.45) years with isolated dissection of the abdominal aorta underwent endovascular stent-graft treatment at our institution between August 2010 and September 2015. Eight patients were symptomatic, and the remaining three were asymptomatic. The asymptomatic patients had aortic aneurysms coexisting with dissection. Eight patients without aneurysm had spontaneous dissections, and the most common symptom was unresponsive abdominal pain. Results The mean abdominal aorta diameter was 46.7 ± 20.6 (range, 31.2-100.9) mm and the mean dissection length was 71.1 ± 47.3 (range, 17-162) mm. Aorto-bi-iliac stent grafts were used in all patients, and were placed successfully under spinal anesthesia in all but one (90.9%) patient. Occlusion developed in one patient due to compression of the aorto-bi-iliac graft. Right-left femoral-femoral bypass was performed in this patient, who could not be placed on the opposite side. In addition, the graft was placed in one patient using the left renal artery chimney technique. No intraoperative mortality occurred, and open surgery was not required. In addition, no death occurred and no additional intervention was required during the mean follow-up period of 25.5 ± 17.1 (range, 6-60) months.

29487715,"Biophysical studies and NMR structure of YAP2 WW domain - LATS1 PPxY motif complexes reveal the basis of their interaction. INTRODUCTION. The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway plays a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis [1, 2]. First discovered in Drosophila [3, 4], the core components of the pathway are highly conserved throughout evolution, with loss-of-function mutants of core pathway components resulting in tissue overgrowth and a diminished cell death phenotype [5]. The pathway has therefore been associated with a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer [6], tissue regeneration and wound healing [2]. The Hippo pathway has been extensively reviewed [5, 7–9]. In short, it involves a cascade of phosphorylation events that culminate in the phosphorylation and deactivation of the transcriptional co-activators, YAP and TAZ, by the LATS serine/threonine kinases. Phosphorylated YAP and TAZ are sequestered into the cytoplasm via several known mechanisms [6, 8] to inhibit the transcription of their target genes. Both YAP and TAZ promote cell growth and inhibit cell death, and are thus regarded as potent oncoproteins. Numerous complexes in the Hippo pathway are mediated by WW domains and their recognition motifs [10]. WW domains are typically 35 to 40 amino acids in length, and are characterized by two highly conserved tryptophan (W) residues separated by 20 to 23 amino acids [11]. They fold into a typical triple-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and interact with proline-rich motifs, such as PPxY (where P is proline, Y is tyrosine and x is any amino acid) [11]. Despite the conservation in their structure, WW domains within different proteins show ligand-specific interactions [12]. These interactions are further influenced by combinations of tandem WW domains and PPxY motifs in some proteins, which lead to selectivity between partners during signal transduction [13]. The Hippo pathway effector, YAP has two major isoforms, YAP1-1 (abbreviated as YAP1), which has a single WW domain, and YAP1-2 (abbreviated as YAP2), which contains two WW domains separated by a linker of 20 to 25 amino acids [14]. The LATS kinase is also reported to have two isoforms: LATS1, with two PPxY motifs separated by 180 amino acids, and LATS2, with only one PPxY motif [15]. YAP and LATS interact through their WW domains and PPxY motifs, respectively, and mutations in these regions abrogate their binding [16, 17]. However, the importance of these tandem domains and motifs in the specific YAP2 and LATS1 isoforms and the bearing this has on their interaction is not fully understood. Here, we report the structural, biophysical and cell-based studies of YAP2 WW domains and LATS1 PPxY motifs to understand their interaction. We find that the first WW domain of YAP2 exhibits a preference for the second PPxY motif of LATS1, whereas the second WW domain of YAP2 prefers the first motif of LATS1. We solved the NMR structures of the complexes between WW domains and PPxY-containing peptides, and identified key residues that are important for the interactions. We show that swapping the WW domains of YAP2 has no effect on the phosphorylation status of its highly conserved phosphorylation site, S127, by LATS1. Furthermore, we show that the region between the two PPxY motifs of LATS1 is unstructured, which may regulate its protein-interaction profile. Collectively, these studies widen our understanding of the molecular basis for the interaction between LATS1 and YAP2. RESULTS. YAP2 WW DOMAINS EXHIBIT BINDING PREFERENCE FOR LATS1 PPXY MOTIFS. We first performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to test for binding preferences between the two WW domains of YAP2 and the two PPxY motifs of LATS1 (Figure 1A). The individual WW domains (WW1 and WW2) were titrated against peptides containing the PPxY motifs from LATS1, NRQPPPPYPLTA (PPxY1) and NYQGPPPPYPKH (PPxY2) (Figure 1A). Among the combinations, the binding affinity was highest between WW1 and PPxY2, with a Kd of 4.2 μM (Figure 1B left and 1C). This suggests that WW1 has a binding preference for the second PPxY motif from LATS1. Further, we found that WW2 showed a higher affinity for the first PPxY motif, with a Kd of 11 μM (Figure 1B right and 1C) as compared with 29 μM for WW2-PPxY2 or 15 μM for WW1-PPxY1 (Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure 1). A similar observation of preferential binding for YAP2 WW domains with PPxY peptides of other proteins has been reported elsewhere [18]. Previous work has also shown that mutation of either of the domains or motifs weakens the interaction between YAP2 and LATS1, and that mutations of both WW domains [16] or both PPxY motifs [17] completely abolishes the interaction. This suggests that both domains and motifs are involved in mediating the interaction. Based on our ITC results, we suggest that YAP2-WW1 and LATS1-PPxY2 form the basis of the interaction while WW2 and PPxY1 act as additional regulators for their binding. NMR STRUCTURES OF WW1-PPXY2 AND WW2-PPXY1. Next, to understand the basis of these preferential interactions, we solved the complex structures using NMR. The binding affinity for the complexes was in the micro-molar range and the complex partially dissociated upon injection into gel filtration chromatography (Supplementary Figure 2). Thus, to prevent complex dissociation, we linked the peptides to their respective domains (WW1-PPxY2 and WW2-PPxY1), thereby maintaining homogeneity of the sample. Further, because the complex would be expressed as a single protein, this aided in labelling the peptides with 15N and 13C. Poly-glycine linkers can be used to trap weak and transient protein interactions for structural studies [19, 20]. We therefore attempted a range of poly-glycine linkers (of 4 to 8 glycine residues) and compared their gel filtration elution profiles. We anticipated that the complex with an optimum linker length would elute similarly to the unlinked complex. The complex with a 4-glycine linker eluted at the same volume as the unlinked complex, whereas the longer linked constructs eluted at sligh",PMC,pos,1,pos,4787,pos_PMC,0.9971717,1

Complications were recorded, grouped by surgical technique, and then classified according to a proposed Grading of Incidence of Complications (IOC). RESULTS Ninety-six publications reporting on 12,168 patients were included; 68 were level IV of evidence studies, 24 were level III, and 4 level II. Perioperative IOC was 26.5% in OP, 36.4% in HP, and 24.2% in MIS. Late IOC was 11.1% in OP, 15.4% in HP, and 14.0% in MIS. IOC was significantly higher for hybrid procedures compared to both open and MIS procedures. CONCLUSIONS Reported complications of surgery for ASD in the recent literature are frequent (24-36% perioperative plus 11-15% late). Open procedures were the most extensively reported in the literature. Complication rates are similar for OP and MIS. HP presented higher IOC likely due to the combination of OP and MIS respective complications. Small number of studies and heterogeneity in reporting could result in risk of bias in these results. Large-scale registry-based studies can fill this gap in the future.

29572015,"Differential effects of single versus repeated minocycline administration-Lack of significant interaction with chronic alcohol history. Neuroimmune cytokines are increased with alcohol withdrawal and may mediate clinical responses associated with alcoholism. Because minocycline regulates the level of cytokines, it has been suggested as a therapeutic for disorders associated with alcohol. Male Wistar rats were exposed to chronic intermittent alcohol (CIA) comprising three 5-day cycles of ethanol liquid diet separated by 2 days of withdrawal. Rats were tested on social interaction, a measure of anxiety-like behavior, followed immediately by collection of amygdala tissue to measure CCL2 and TNFα or collection of the blood to measure corticosterone (CORT). One group received a single minocycline injection 3 h into the final CIA withdrawal and was tested 2 h later. A second group received injections during each of the three withdrawals and was similarly tested during the final acute withdrawal. A third group received a single injection at 23 h into withdrawal (extended withdrawal) and was tested 6 h later. Results showed that CIA withdrawal increased anxiety-like behavior. A single injection of minocycline during the final acute withdrawal increased anxiety-like behavior in rats that consumed liquid diet with or without alcohol, but this effect disappeared with repeated injections of minocycline. Differences in alcohol intake, blood alcohol level, and plasma CORT levels did not explain results. Only repeated injections of minocycline decreased TNFα mRNA levels in rats that consumed liquid diet with or without alcohol. When a single injection of minocycline was given during extended withdrawal, it decreased CCL2 mRNA levels, but did not reverse the elevation of CCL2 protein. These results suggest that minocycline has actions in brain and on behavior, but minocycline does not significantly impact these actions in relation to alcohol withdrawal.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,4812,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0025960316,0

29604530,"Double cross finger flaps from the middle to the index or ring finger: A case series of 4 patients with an emphasis on donor finger morbidity. HIGHLIGHTS. - • The use of two cross finger flaps from one digit has not been previously reported. - • We report on a case series (4 patients) of double cross fingers flaps. - • The study shows that the technique is feasible and is easily executed. - • The results document an acceptable donor finger morbidity. 1. INTRODUCTION. The cross finger flap was described several decades ago [1] and is an accepted method of reconstruction of small or medium-sized digital defects [2]. There are several advantages of cross finger flaps such as ease of dissection, simplicity, and the reliable blood supply. Furthermore, several modifications of the flap may be used to suit the defect, such as the use of innervated (sensory) cross finger flaps for fingertip reconstruction [[3], [4]]. However, cross finger flaps also have disadvantages such as the need for two stages and donor finger morbidity [[5], [6]]. To reduce donor site morbidity, cross finger flaps are usually harvested from the dorsal aspect (rather than the palmar aspect) of the donor digit, avoiding the skin over the interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints. Previous authors reporting on the use of cross finger flaps utilized one donor site per digit. The flap is usually designed on the dorsal skin between the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints or the area between the proximal interphalangeal joint and the metacarpophalangeal joint. The area distal to the distal interphalangeal joint is rarely used between it is small in size and also because of its proximity to the nail bed. Due to the relative size of the middle finger, large index or ring finger defects may be covered by two cross finger flaps from the middle finger. The use of two donor sites from a single donor digit has not been reported in the literature. We report on a series of 4 cases with an emphasis on donor digit morbidity. The case series is compliant with the PROCESS Guidelines [7]. 2. PATIENTS AND METHODS. The study was performed at a hospital with a high volume of industrial accident patients. The current retrospective study was approved by the research committee of the hospital. Over the last 12 years (2006–2017, inclusive), four cases of large index or ring finger defects wee reconstructed by two cross finger flaps harvested from the middle finger. 2.1. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE AND POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION. Double de-epithelialized cross finger flaps were used to reconstruct large dorsal digital defects. The flaps are marked on the dorsal aspect of middle and proximal phalanges of the middle finger; preserving the skin over the proximal interphalangeal joint. The flaps were marked with their bases (i.e. their blood supply) on the side adjacent to the defect. First, the marked flaps are de-epithelialized using a 10-blade. De-epithelialization is done carefully in order to preserve the dermis. Once de-epithelialization is complete, the flaps are raised preserving the paratenon over the extensor apparatus in the donor middle finger. The two flaps are then flipped and sutured to the fare edges of the defect; with the dermal sides of the flaps directly covering the defect. Finally, the exposed subcutaneous sides of the flaps in the recipient finger as well as the exposed paratenon in the donor middle finger are covered with split-thickness skin grafts. The skin grafts are covered with wet gauze. Buddy-taping of the donor and recipient fingers completes the dressing. No splints are used and the patient starts active mobilization of all fingers on the first postoperative day. The double classic cross finger flaps are used to reconstruct large volar digital defects. The technique and postoperative rehabilitation are similar to those described above for de-epithelialized flaps except that the flaps are not de-epithelialized. Hence, skin grafts are required to cover the donor defect only. 2.2. DATA COLLECTION. The following data were collected: age, sex, mechanism of injury, site of the defect in the index/ring finger, concurrent injuries, time of surgery, donor sites from the middle finger, type of cross finger flap used, type of skin graft used, time of flap division, postoperative complications, and time of follow-up. At final follow-up, the total range of motion of the donor and injured fingers were recorded. Furthermore, we documented donor finger morbidities such as painful neuromas, skin graft instability and cold intolerance. Finally, any reported cosmetic concerns were documented. 3. RESULTS. The demographic data of the four patients are shown in Table 1. All patients were young (26–32 years) male industrial workers and were right hand dominant. Two patients (Cases #1&2) had dorsal digital defects (one in the ring finger and one in the index finger), and the other two patients (Cases #3&4) had volar digital defects (both in the index finger). Coverage of each defect required two cross finger flaps from the adjacent middle finger. Split-thickness skin grafts were used in all cases, and flap division was done 17–18 days later. This period of flap division was not specific for double cross finger flaps (the senior author also divides single flaps at the same period). No postoperative complications (such as bleeding, infection, skin graft loss, flap dehiscence, or complex regional pain syndrome) were noted. Follow-up ranged from 7 to 10 months (Table 1). The ranges of motion of the donor and recipient fingers at final follow are shown in Table 2. Special emphasis was put on documenting donor middle finger range of motion. All donor fingers had full ranges of motion at the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. However, a variable degree of stiffness (see Table 2), were noted at the distal interphalangeal joints in all cases with loss in the arc of flexion (i.e. there were no flexion contractures). None of the patients complained of painful neuromas (at the site of the transected dorsal sensory nerves).

29606590,"Structural Basis of Transcription Inhibition by Fidaxomicin (Lipiarmycin A3). SUMMARY. Fidaxomicin is an antibacterial drug in clinical use in treatment of Clostridium difficile diarrhea. The active ingredient of the antibacterial drug fidaxomicin, lipiarmycin A3 (Lpm), functions by inhibiting bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here, we report a cryo-EM structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNAP holoenzyme in complex with Lpm at 3.5 Å resolution. The structure shows that Lpm binds at the base of the RNAP ""clamp."" The structure exhibits an open conformation of the RNAP clamp, suggesting that Lpm traps an open-clamp state. Single-molecule fluorescence-resonance-energy-transfer experiments confirm that Lpm traps an open-clamp state and define effects of Lpm on clamp dynamics. We suggest that Lpm inhibits transcription by trapping an open-clamp state, preventing simultaneous interaction with promoter −10 and −35 elements. The results account for the absence of cross-resistance between Lpm and other RNAP inhibitors, account for structure-activity relationships of Lpm derivatives, and enable structure-based design of improved Lpm derivatives. INTRODUCTION. Fidaxomicin is an antibacterial drug in clinical use in treatment of Clostridium difficile diarrhea (Lancaster and Matthews, 2012; Venugopal and Johnson, 2012). The active pharmaceutical ingredient of fidaxomicin, lipiarmycin A3 (Lpm; Kaufmann et al., 2015; Serra et al., 2017; Fig. S1A), is a macrocyclic antibiotic with bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria and efflux-deficient strains of Gram-negative bacteria (Lancaster and Matthews, 2012; Venugopal and Johnson, 2012; Srivastava et al., 2011). Lpm functions by inhibiting bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP; Talpaert et al., 1975; Sonenshein et al., 1977; Sonenshein and Alexander, 1979). Lpm exhibits no cross-resistance with the classic RNAP inhibitor rifampin (Rif; Sonenshein et al., 1977; Ebright, 2005) and inhibits transcription initiation at an earlier step than Rif (Sonenshein et al., 1977; Ebright, 2005; Tupin et al., 2010; Artsimovitch et al., 2012), suggesting that the binding site and mechanism of Lpm differ from those of Rif. Efforts spanning more than a decade to obtain structural information on RNAP-Lpm by use of X-ray crystallography have been unsuccessful. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. STRUCTURE OF MTB RNAP-LPM. Structural information on RNAP is available for three bacterial genera: the Gram-positive bacterial genus Mycobacterium (Hubin et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017), the Gram-negative bacterial genus Escherichia (Murakami et al., 2013), and the Thermus/Deinococcus-clade bacterial genus Thermus (Zhang et al., 1999; Vassylyev et al., 2002). Lpm potently inhibits RNAP from genus Mycobacterium and genus Escherichia (IC50s = 0.3 μM and 8 μM, respectively; Talpaert et al., 1975; Kurabachew, 2008; Fig. S1B), but only poorly inhibits RNAP from genus Thermus (IC50 = 200 μM; Fig. S1B). Accordingly, efforts in our laboratory to obtain structural and functional information on RNAP-Lpm focussed on RNAP from genus Mycobacterium and genus Escherichia. We first sought to obtain structural information on RNAP-Lpm by use of X-ray crystallography. However, we were unable to prepare crystals of RNAP-Lpm, despite numerous attempts at crystal soaking (assessing all reported crystal forms of RNAP from genus Mycobacterium and genus Escherichia) and co-crystallization (assessing crystallization conditions for all reported crystal forms of RNAP from genus Mycobacterium and genus Escherichia, and assessing >104 additional crystallization conditions by robotic screening). We then sought to obtain structural information on RNAP-Lpm by use of cryo-EM with single-particle reconstruction (Merino and Raunser, 2017; Boland et al., 2017). Pilot experiments suggested that cryo-EM particle-orientation distributions using RNAP from genus Mycobacterium were more favorable for high-resolution structure determination than cryo-EM particle-orientation distributions using RNAP from genus Escherichia. Accordingly, our cryo-EM analysis focussed on RNAP from genus Mycobacterium. We determined a structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) RNAP σA holoenzyme in complex with Lpm by use of cryo-EM with single-particle reconstruction (Merino and Raunser, 2017; Boland et al., 2017) (Figs. 1, S1-S3). The cryo-EM density map shows unambiguous density for RNAP, including the taxon-specific, Mycobacterium-specific sequence insertion (β′MtbSI or ""gate""; Lin et al., 2017), for σ conserved regions 2, 3, and 4 (σR2, σR3, and σR4), and for Lpm. The mean resolution of the structure is 3.5 Å (Fig. S1F). Local resolution ranges from ~2.5-3.8 Å in central parts of the structure, including RNAP residues close to Lpm, to ~5-6.5 Å in peripheral parts of the structure, including β′MtbSI and σR4 (Figs. 1a, S1G, S2A). Local B-factors range from ~8-100 Å2 in central regions to ~300-400 Å2 in peripheral regions (Fig. 2B). The map show clear density for backbone and sidechain atoms of RNAP and individual functional groups of Lpm (Fig. S2C-D). The cryo-EM structure shows that the Lpm binding site is located at the base of the RNAP clamp (Landick, 2001; Cramer et al., 2001; Chakraborty et al., 2012) and encompasses RNAP clamp α-helices βa16α1 and β′a4α1 and RNAP switch-region (Cramer et al., 2001; Srivastava et al., 2011) switches SW2, SW3, and SW4 (Figs. 1, S3). Lpm binds to RNAP in a fully-extended conformation similar to conformations in crystal structures of Lpm alone (Fig. S3A). All five structural moieties of Lpm--isobutyryl, β-D-noviosyl, macrocycle, β-D-rhamnosyl, and homodichloro-orsellinyl--interact with RNAP (Figs. 1D-E, S1A, S3B-C). Lpm makes H-bonds with six RNAP residues: βT1096 (V1298), βK1101 (K1303), β′R84 (Q94), β′R89 (R99), β′E323 (D248), and β′R412 (R337) [residues numbered as in Mtb RNAP (UniProtKB: P9WGY9, UniProtKB: P9WGY7) and, in parentheses, as in Escherichia coli RNAP (UniProtKB: P0A8V2, UniProtKB: P0A8T7)].

29677513,"Nuclear Import Receptor Inhibits Phase Separation of FUS through Binding to Multiple Sites. SUMMARY. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is believed to underlie formation of biomolecular condensates, cellular compartments that concentrate macromolecules without surrounding membranes. Physical mechanisms that control condensate formation/dissolution are poorly understood. The RNA-binding protein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the Importin Karyopherin-β2/Transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of Karyopherin-β2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS. NMR analyses reveal weak interactions of Karyopherin-β2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. The data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of Karyopherin-β2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS. Karyopherin-β2 may act analogously to control condensates in diverse cellular contexts. INTRODUCTION. The RNA-binding protein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) plays roles in transcription, RNA processing and DNA repair (Ederle and Dormann, 2017). FUS is localized primarily to the nucleus but is also found in cytoplasmic RNP granules (Crozat et al., 1993; Ryu et al., 2014). Heat shock and DNA damage promote localization of the protein to cytoplasmic and nuclear puncta (Patel et al., 2015). FUS is involved in diverse diseases including cancer and the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) (Harrison and Shorter, 2017; Schwartz et al., 2015). In ALS, FUS is often mutated in its proline-tyrosine nuclear localization sequence (PY-NLS). These alterations decrease affinity for the nuclear import factor Karyopherin-β2 (Kapβ2; also known as Transportin-1) leading to aberrant cytoplasmic localization and enrichment in RNP granules (Dormann and Haass, 2011; Zhang and Chook, 2012). Proper compartmentalization of FUS is important in maintaining cellular homeostasis, as the degree of FUS mislocalization correlates with ALS onset and severity (Dormann and Haass, 2011). FUS is composed of multiple structural and functional elements. It has an N-terminal disordered region with low amino acid sequence complexity that is enriched in Gly, Ser, Tyr and Gln residues (LC region), followed by a segment with Arg-Gly-Gly motifs (RGG1), a folded RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) domain, two additional RGG regions (RGG2 and RGG3) flanking a zinc-finger (ZnF) domain, and a C-terminal 26-residue PY-NLS (Figure 1A) (Ederle and Dormann, 2017). FUS is highly prone to self-association, a process that can lead to different material states including phase separated liquids, amyloid fiber containing hydrogels and aggregated solids (Burke et al., 2015; Kato et al., 2012; Murakami et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2011). The LC region undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) at high concentrations, through weak and transient homotypic interactions (Burke et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015). Full-length FUS also undergoes LLPS, but at much lower concentrations, consistent with previous reports that the RGG regions can contribute to self-association of the protein (Patel et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2011). RNA enhances these processes (Burke et al., 2015; Schwartz et al., 2013). Phase separation of FUS and other disordered proteins is driven by a variety of interaction types including charge-charge, cation-π, π-π stacking and hydrogen bonds, involving side chains and backbone (Banani et al., 2017; Brangwynne et al., 2015). Over time, phase separated FUS droplets mature to more solid hydrogels that contain amyloid-like fibers (Burke et al., 2015; Kato et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2015; Murakami et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2015). Disease-causing mutations accelerate maturation of FUS droplets in vitro (Murakami et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2015). A recent solid state NMR analysis of fibers formed by the FUS LC region revealed a β-strand-containing structured core spanning residues 39–95, whose formation also appears to contribute to LLPS (Murray et al., 2017). Similar LLPS and maturation behaviors have been observed for other RNA binding proteins containing disordered or LC regions (Lin et al., 2015; Molliex et al., 2015; Xiang et al., 2015). The progression from phase separated liquid to a more static solid is likely controlled in cells to produce structures of different material properties, according to specific cellular needs. However the biological factors that can control self-association, LLPS and fiber formation of FUS are not known. The FUS PY-NLS and its ALS-associated mutations seem to play no direct role in FUS self-association (Ju et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2011). However, FUS PY-NLS binding to Kapβ2 controls nuclear-cytoplasmic localization of FUS and cytoplasmic concentrations of FUS likely controls self-association and disease onset (Dormann and Haass, 2011). Kapβ2 is also the only high-affinity binding partner of FUS that has been characterized to date (Zhang and Chook, 2012). Although it is well established that Kapβ2 imports FUS into the nucleus, it is not known if Kapβ2 binding directly affects FUS self-association and/or its ability to undergo LLPS. Here, we show that Kapβ2 inhibits LLPS of FUS, in a manner dependent on interactions with the FUS PY-NLS. The Importin-α•Importin-β (Impα/β) heterodimer and the yeast Kap121, can also inhibit FUS LLPS when the FUS PY-NLS is replaced with the appropriate cognate NLSs. Thus, Importins may generally be able to control LLPS of self-associating RNA-binding proteins through high-affinity binding to their NLSs. NMR analyses reveal multiple weak interactions of Kapβ2 with both folded and disordered regions across FUS.

29681470,"Structural Basis for the Initiation of Glycosaminoglycan Biosynthesis by Human Xylosyltransferase 1. SUMMARY. Proteoglycans (PGs) are essential components of the animal extracellular matrix and are required for cell adhesion, migration, signaling, and immune function. PGs are composed of a core protein and long glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, which often specify PG function. GAG biosynthesis is initiated by peptide O-xylosyltransferases, which transfer xylose onto selected serine residues in the core proteins. We have determined crystal structures of human xylosyltransferase 1 (XT1) in complex with the sugar donor, UDP-xylose, and various acceptor peptides. The structures reveal unique active-site features that, in conjunction with functional experiments, explain the substrate specificity of XT1. A constriction within the peptide binding cleft requires the acceptor serine to be followed by glycine or alanine. The remainder of the cleft can accommodate a wide variety of sequences, but with a general preference for acidic residues. These findings provide a framework for understanding the selectivity of GAG attachment. INTRODUCTION. Proteoglycans (PGs) are a diverse family of glycoproteins characterized by the presence of one or more covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, which often dominate the biophysical properties and biological functions of PGs. GAGs are polymers of repeating disaccharide units consisting of a hexosamine and a uronic acid sugar; the polymer is modified by sulfation at various positions (Esko et al., 2009, Iozzo and Schaefer, 2015). Depending on the hexosamine, GAGs are classified as either heparan sulfate (HS) or as chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS). PGs are present on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix of all higher animals. They are essential components of extracellular matrices and play important roles in cell adhesion and migration, morphogen and growth factor signaling, immune regulation, and the inflammatory response. PG dysfunction is linked to many conditions with major public health implications, such as arthritis, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, and cancer (Bishop et al., 2007, Couchman, 2010, Mikami and Kitagawa, 2013). The GAG component of PGs is synthesized in the Golgi compartment during passage of the core protein through the secretory pathway. HS, CS, and DS are attached to serine residues on the core protein through a common GlcA-β1,3-Gal-β1,3-Gal-β1,4-Xyl-β1-O-Ser tetrasaccharide linker (Kreuger and Kjellen, 2012, Mikami and Kitagawa, 2013). The linker is synthesized by four glycosyltransferases (GTs) acting sequentially (Figure 1A); phosphorylation of the xylose by Fam20B is required for addition of the second galactose (Koike et al., 2009, Koike et al., 2014, Wen et al., 2014). The first enzyme in the pathway, peptide O-xylosyltransferase (XT, EC 2.4.2.26), catalyzes the transfer of xylose from uridine diphosphate (UDP)-α-D-xylose onto serine and thus determines the site(s) of GAG attachment on the core protein. The serine-linked xylose is in β-anomeric configuration and XT is therefore classified as an “inverting” GT (Lairson et al., 2008). Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have one XT (known as sqv-6 and OXT, respectively), whereas vertebrates have two isozymes, XT1 and XT2 (60% amino acid identity in humans) (Götting et al., 2000, Hwang et al., 2003, Wilson, 2002). Disruption of tetrasaccharide linker biosynthesis in mice by genetic ablation of the glucuronyl transferase results in embryonic lethality before the 8-cell stage (Izumikawa et al., 2010). The combined function of XT1 and XT2 is expected to be similarly essential, but double-knockout mice have not been described. Genetic screens in zebrafish and mouse have revealed a function of XT1 in chondrocyte maturation during bone development (Eames et al., 2011, Mis et al., 2014). XT2-deficient mice are viable, but develop polycystic liver and kidney disease (Condac et al., 2007). In humans, XYLT1 and XYLT2 mutations cause two rare diseases with skeletal abnormalities, Desbuquois dysplasia type 2 and spondylo-ocular syndrome, respectively (Bui et al., 2014, Munns et al., 2015). The phenotypes suggest that XT1 and XT2 are not fully redundant, consistent with their somewhat different expression patterns (Eames et al., 2011, Roch et al., 2010). XT1 and XT2 are type II transmembrane proteins consisting of a short amino-terminal region facing the cytosol, a single transmembrane helix, a stem region required for Golgi localization (Schön et al., 2006), a catalytic GT-A domain (Lairson et al., 2008, Müller et al., 2006), and a unique C-terminal domain of unknown function, termed “Xylo_C” in the Pfam database (Finn et al., 2008). This topology places the catalytic GT domain inside the Golgi lumen. The acceptor peptide specificities of XT1 and XT2 have been inferred from the sequences of known GAG attachment sites: the acceptor serine generally is flanked by glycines, and there frequently is a patch of acidic residues between positions −4 and −2 (position 0 being the acceptor serine) (Esko and Zhang, 1996). These preferences were largely confirmed by a study using recombinant enzymes and peptide substrates (Roch et al., 2010). How the XT active site specifically selects certain serine residues for covalent modification has remained unknown, however. To better understand the initial step of GAG biosynthesis, we have determined crystal structures of human XT1 complexed with UDP-xylose and various PG-derived acceptor peptides. Combined with biochemical results, the structures define the catalytic mechanism of XT1 and the molecular basis for selection of GAG attachment sites. RESULTS. XT1 CRYSTAL STRUCTURE. We obtained crystals of a human XT1 construct spanning residues 232–959 and determined its structure at 1.9-Å resolution. Inspection of the GT active site revealed patchy electron density for a co-purified, unidentified ligand.

The genus is distributed mainly from the Himalayas to Japan with about 20 species, and only one species (I. virginica L.) is disjunctly distributed and unique to eastern North America (Guo and Ricklefs, 2000; Jin and Ohba, 2001). Southeastern China is the center of diversity for the genus, where there are about 15 species, 10 of which are endemic (Jin and Ohba, 2001; Hermsen, 2013). The plants of Itea are shrubs and small trees and generally occur in montane forest or wet habitats ranging in elevation from sea level up to about 3000 m. Itea chinensis Hook. & Arn. is a widespread species in the genus. It grows in mountain slopes, sparse forests, along streams, or in valleys from 100–2400 m and is a common component in the understory of evergreen broadleaf forests (Jin and Ohba, 2001). It has been reported that individuals are variable in the shape, size, and marginal dentation of leaf blades (Jin, 1995). It is unknown whether these variations are the result of phenotypic plasticity or ecotypic variation, and molecular data may help to resolve the question. However, genetic markers for the analysis of genetic variation of the species or other species within the genus have not yet been developed. Therefore, we developed and characterized 16 microsatellite markers for I. chinensis that we will use to investigate its genetic diversity, especially spatial genetic structure, to understand the effects of environment on the genetic structure of the species. We also tested the transferability of these markers in three populations of two congeneric species endemic to China, I. oblonga Hand.‐Mazz. and I. yangchunensis S. Y. Jin. METHODS AND RESULTS. A total of 60 individuals of I. chinensis were collected from three natural populations in Guangdong Province (Heishiding, Fengkai County [HSD]; Dinghushan, Zhaoqing County [DHS], and Shimentai, Yingde County [SMT]; Appendix 1). Genomic DNA was isolated from silica‐dried leaves of the individuals using the HiPure SF Plant DNA Kit (Magen, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) following the manufacturer's protocol. Voucher specimens are deposited at the Herbarium of Sun Yat‐sen University (SYS), Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (Appendix 1). For RNA extraction, young and healthy leaves of an I. chinensis seedling were obtained from the Heishiding Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province, and transported to the laboratory in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted by using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method (Fu et al., 2005). Subsequently, the integral cDNA libraries were constructed for sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 System (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). Using Trinity (trinityrnaseq‐2.1.1) with the default parameters (Grabherr et al., 2011), 90,263 nucleotide paired‐end reads were generated. All sequence information has been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (accession no. SRR6067069). The transcripts, with further processing and filtering by CAP3 (minimum identity = 99%), yielded a set of 80,181 nonredundant sequences with an average length of 600.48 bp and an N50 length of 860 bp (Huang and Madan, 1999). Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) from the unigenes were detected using MISA version 1.0 with the default parameters (Thiel et al., 2003). We screened for SSRs containing motifs of two to six nucleotides with the minimum number of repeats as follows: six for dinucleotide and five for trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, pentanucleotide, and hexanucleotide. Finally, 23,363 SSR regions were selected, and 36 of them were chosen at random to develop primers using Primer3 (Rozen and Skaletsky, 1999). The optimum conditions were set at: primer length of 22–25 bp, annealing temperature of 60–65°C, and product size range of 100–500 bp. For trial PCR, three individuals were randomly selected from each population (i.e., total of nine samples) for tests on the amplification of the 36 primer pairs. PCR amplifications were performed on a 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) under the following conditions: initial denaturation was at 94°C for 4 min; followed by 30 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, then annealing at 62°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 30 s; with a final extension of 5 min at 72°C. PCR products were visualized on 6% polyacrylamide gel with a 10‐bp DNA ladder (TransGen Biotech Co., Beijing, China). Of the 36 primer pairs, 20 did not amplify at all, and 16 produced PCR products with clear and polymorphic bands among the nine individuals. The sequences of the SSR regions were deposited in GenBank (Table 1). To further evaluate the level of polymorphism of the SSR markers, genotyping was performed on all individuals of I. chinensis. PCR amplifications were performed in a final volume of 20 μL, containing 20 ng of genomic DNA, 1× PCR buffer (10 mM Tris‐HCl [pH 8.4] and 1.5 mM MgCl2; TransGen Biotech Co.), 0.2 mM dNTPs (TransGen Biotech Co.), 0.5 μM of each primer (5′ labeled with FAM or HEX) (Life Technologies, Shanghai, China), and 1 unit EasyTaq DNA polymerase (TransGen Biotech Co.). The PCR reactions were carried out on a 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) under the same conditions as the trial PCR. PCR products were analyzed on an ABI 3730XL DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and resolved with the GeneScan 500 LIZ internal size standard (Applied Biosystems). The peaks of the loci were read using Peak Scanner version 1.0 (Applied Biosystems).Basic statistical parameters, including the number of alleles, observed heterozygosity, unbiased expected heterozygosity, and fixation index, were obtained using GenAlEx version 6.5 (Peakall and Smouse, 2012). Deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) at each locus in each population were estimated using GENEPOP version 4.3 (Rousset, 2008).

29776555,"Sudden coronary death in the young: Evidence of contractile phenotype of smooth muscle cells in the culprit atherosclerotic plaque. BACKGROUND Culprit coronary atherosclerotic plaques (APs) from young sudden cardiac death (SCD) victims are mostly non-atheromatous, i.e., consisting of proliferative smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Coronary vasospasm has been advocated to explain plaque instability in the absence of thrombosis. Our aim was to characterize the SMC phenotype in the intima and media of coronary arteries from young SCD victims. METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 38 coronary artery segments were studied: (a) 18 APs from young (≤40 years old) SCD patients, (b) 9 APs from old (>40 years old) SCD patients, (c) 11 non-atherosclerotic coronary arteries from young patients (≤40 years old). Markers of differentiated SMCs such as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), smooth muscle myosin heavy chains (SMMHCs), and heavy-caldesmon (h-CaD), were assessed in intima and media by immunohistochemistry and quantified morphometrically. In the intima, their expression was higher in non-atherosclerotic arteries (44.37 ± 3.03% for α-SMA, 14.21 ± 2.01% for SMMHCs, 8.90 ± 1.33% for h-CaD) and APs from young SCD victims (38.95 ± 2.29% for α-SMA, 11.92 ± 1.92% for SMMHCs, 8.93 ± 1.12% for h-CaD) compared with old patients (22.01 ± 3.56% for α-SMA, 6.39 ± 0.7% for SMMHCs, 3.00 ± 0.57% for h-CaD; all P statistically significant). The media of non-atherosclerotic arteries and APs from young SCD victims exhibited strong positivity for the differentiation markers unlike that of old patients. CONCLUSIONS SMCs of coronary APs as well as from the underlying media from young SCD victims exhibit strong contractile phenotype. In the setting of critical stenosis, both intima and media SMC contractility might contribute to transient coronary spasm leading to myocardial ischemia and SCD.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,4866,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.003449689,0
29791485,"Alterations in the brain interactome of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) in Alzheimer's disease. INTRODUCTION. Prion diseases in humans and other mammals are characterized by a conformational transition of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into an aberrantly folded isoform, designated Scrapie prion protein (PrPSc). PrPSc can form amyloid plaques in the diseased brain and is the major constituent of infectious prions (rev. in [1–4]). In the absence of PrPC mice are resistant to prion diseases and cannot propagate infectious prions [5]. Moreover, expression of PrPC in neurons mediates neurotoxic effects of Scrapie-prions [6–9], amyloid beta (Aβ) [10–13], and α-synuclein [14]. Structural studies revealed that PrPC is composed of two major domains of similar size. The structured C-terminal domain contains three alpha-helical regions and a short, two-stranded beta-sheet, while the N-terminal domain is intrinsically disordered [15–17]. Originally, the activity of a protein was thought to be linked to the ability of the polypeptide chain to adopt a stable secondary/tertiary structure. This concept was extended when it became evident that intrinsically disordered domains (IDDs) and proteins can participate in a broad range of defined physiological activities and play a major role in several protein classes. Specifically, IDDs can bind to different partner molecules with diverse functional consequences [18–21]. Most of the unstructured domain of PrPC is dispensable for the formation of infectious prions and PrPSc: PrP27-30, the protease K-resistant core of PrPSc, lacks amino acids (aa) 23–90, but is still infectious [22, 23]. Similarly, propagation of infectious prions is supported in transgenic mice expressing only a truncated version of PrP devoid of aa 32–93 [24]. However, various approaches in transgenic mice and cultured cells including primary neurons revealed that the N-terminal domain (N-PrP) modulates the signaling activity of PrPC. Strikingly, this role of N-PrP is diverse and seemingly contradictory. For example, the physiological function of PrPC to promote neuronal viability under various stress conditions is linked to this domain. On the other hand, the toxic activity of certain PrP mutants and the ability of PrPC to mediate neurotoxic signaling of Aβ and PrPSc is also dependent on N-PrP (rev. in [12, 25–27]). In this context it is important to note that N-PrP is generated in vivo via the proteolytic processing of mature PrPC by a yet unknown protease [28–31], indicating a specific function of the shedded domain. A soluble N-terminal fragment of PrPC was described to promote peripheral myelination by activating the G protein-coupled receptor Adgrg6 [32]. Strikingly, the mode of action of N-PrP might change after it is released from PrPC. In the context of full-length GPI-anchored PrPC the N-terminal domain mediates neurotoxic effects of Aβ while a secreted version abrogates Aβ-induced toxicity, presumably by trapping toxic Aβ species [13, 33–35]. To mechanistically understand these different properties of N-PrP, the identification of interacting proteins is important. So far, PrP-interacting proteins were identified by using recombinant or cellular full-length PrP as a bait. Here, we present a novel approach to generate and employ N-PrP coupled to beads for the analysis of the brain interactome of PrP. Our study emphasizes the prominent role of the unstructured N-terminal domain in mediating PrPC-protein interactions and reveals alterations of the PrP interactome in Alzheimer’s disease. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. To generate a bait for affinity purification of proteins that interact with the IDD of PrPC (N-PrP) we covalently coupled recombinant N-PrP to amino-PEGA resin. The basic idea of this new approach is to couple the protein of interest onto a solid support by using expressed protein ligation methods [36]. The method relies on a cysteine coupled to a PEGA resin and a C-terminal thioester on N-PrP. In the present work a chimeric protein was cloned composed of PrP (aa 23–114) fused to an MXE GyrA intein followed by a His-tag (His) and a chitin-binding domain (CBD). The C-terminally activated thioester, necessary for the ligation step, was generated by cleaving off MXE-His-CBP with 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (mesna). The final binding of PrP (aa 23–114) to the beads was accomplished by chemical ligation [37]. The fusion protein PrP23-114-MXE-His-CBD was expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Fig 1A). As illustrated in Fig 1B (left panel, F12-20), PrP23-114-MXE-His-CBD was eluted from the Ni NTA column together with minor amounts of MXE-His-CBD. To cleave N-PrP off the fusion protein and to generate an activated thioester at the C-terminus, the protein was incubated with mesna. After a 4 day incubation in mesna, most of the PrP23-114-MXE-His-CBD fusion protein had been split into MXE-His-CBD and the PrP23-114 thioester. The mixture was fractionated by preparative HPLC using a hydrophobic column to obtain purified PrP23-114 thioester (Fig 1B, right panel). The identity of this sample was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS) (data not shown). In parallel, amino-PEGA resin was modified with cysteines by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) [38]. Finally, the C-terminus of the PrP23-114 thioester was covalently coupled to the cysteine-modified PEGA resin via native chemical ligation (Fig 1). To analyze the human brain interactome of N-PrP and possible alterations linked to Alzheimer’s disease N-PrP beads were incubated in protein extracts prepared from the parietal cortex of an AD- and a non-AD patient to affinity purify N-PrP interactors (Table 1). As a control, the brain lysates were incubated with beads modified with cysteines but lacking N-PrP. After extensive washing with lysis and washing buffer the beads were pelleted by centrifugation and proteins bound to the beads were eluted by boiling in SDS buffer and identified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS/MS) (Fig 2).

29794134,"Molecular basis for the loss-of-function effects of the Alzheimer's disease-associated R47H variant of the immune receptor TREM2. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an immune receptor expressed on the surface of microglia, macrophages, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts. The R47H TREM2 variant is a significant risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the molecular basis of R47H TREM2 loss of function is an emerging area of TREM2 biology. Here, we report three high-resolution structures of the extracellular ligand-binding domains (ECDs) of R47H TREM2, apo-WT, and phosphatidylserine (PS)-bound WT TREM2 at 1.8, 2.2, and 2.2 Å, respectively. The structures reveal that Arg47 plays a critical role in maintaining the structural features of the complementarity-determining region 2 (CDR2) loop and the putative positive ligand-interacting surface (PLIS), stabilizing conformations capable of ligand interaction. This is exemplified in the PS-bound structure, in which the CDR2 loop and PLIS drive critical interactions with PS via surfaces that are disrupted in the variant. Together with in vitro and in vivo characterization, our structural findings elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying loss of ligand binding, putative oligomerization, and functional activity of R47H TREM2. They also help unravel how decreased in vitro and in vivo stability of TREM2 contribute to loss of function in disease.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4872,pos_MEDLINE,0.99744415,1
29861345,"Biophysical Characterization of the Tandem FHA Domain Regulatory Module from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis ABC Transporter Rv1747. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATP-binding cassette transporter Rv1747 is a putative exporter of cell wall biosynthesis intermediates. Rv1747 has a cytoplasmic regulatory module consisting of two pThr-interacting Forkhead-associated (FHA) domains connected by a conformationally disordered linker with two phospho-acceptor threonines (pThr). The structures of FHA-1 and FHA-2 were determined by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, respectively. Relative to the canonical 11-strand β-sandwich FHA domain fold of FHA-1, FHA-2 is circularly permuted and lacking one β-strand. Nevertheless, the two share a conserved pThr-binding cleft. FHA-2 is less stable and more dynamic than FHA-1, yet binds model pThr peptides with moderately higher affinity (∼50 μM versus 500 μM equilibrium dissociation constants). Based on NMR relaxation and chemical shift perturbation measurements, when joined within a polypeptide chain, either FHA domain can bind either linker pThr to form intra- and intermolecular complexes. We hypothesize that this enables tunable phosphorylation-dependent multimerization to regulate Rv1747 transporter activity.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4877,pos_MEDLINE,0.9978884,1
29863047,"[Home Medical Care for Heart Failure Patients: Pharmaceutical Education Program of Chiba University]. The number of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) is increasing in Japan.

Multidisciplinary care, involving physicians, nurses, pharmacists, care managers, et al., is indispensable for providing safe, appropriate home medical care for CHF patients. In multidisciplinary care, pharmacists play an important role, especially in improving patient adherence to CHF treatment regimens. Pharmacists are also expected to participate actively in the improvement of patients' quality of life and the avoidance of hospital readmission.

29892507,"Metal-binding polymorphism in late embryogenesis abundant protein AtLEA4-5, an intrinsically disordered protein. INTRODUCTION. Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are highly expressed and accumulated in plants during the dehydration stage of seeds and pollen, but also in response to water deficit conditions and to other adverse environments (Dure et al., 1983; Battaglia et al., 2008; Hand et al., 2011). These characteristics have suggested that their main role is to confer tolerance to stress conditions (Kovács, Agoston & Tompa, 2008; Hincha & Thalhammer, 2012). LEA proteins are grouped in seven families (LEA1–LEA7) according to their sequence similarity, phylogeny, and characteristic motifs (Battaglia et al., 2008). Most of them are classified as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), due in part to their high content of small, polar, and charged amino acids (Garay-Arroyo et al., 2000; Battaglia et al., 2008; Olvera-Carrillo, Reyes & Covarrubias, 2011; Hincha & Thalhammer, 2012). Experimental evidence by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance have confirmed large amounts of disordered conformations for some members (Rivera-Najera et al., 2014; Cuevas-Velazquez et al., 2016). However, in the presence of α-helix inducers as trifluoroethanol LEA proteins may undergo transitions to partially folded states. This phenomenon also occurs under dehydration and conditions that simulate low osmotic potentials or macromolecular crowding (Soulages et al., 2002; Cuevas-Velazquez et al., 2016; Bremer et al., 2017). To promote tolerance of plants, they may act as chaperone-like proteins by interacting with other proteins to preclude the inactivation and subsequent aggregation that they experience under stress conditions (Reyes et al., 2005; Chakrabortee et al., 2007; Kovács, Agoston & Tompa, 2008; Battaglia & Covarrubias, 2013). There is also evidence indicating that some LEA proteins may be involved in the stabilization of biological membranes (Koag et al., 2009; Bremer et al., 2017) and in nucleic acids protection by direct interaction (Hara et al., 2009; Saumonneau et al., 2012). Furthermore, it has been reported that LEA proteins from different families are able to bind metals, suggesting a role as metal ion sequestering agents (Krüger et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2011; Hara et al., 2016). In plants, metal ions can accumulate to levels that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), compromising the survival of cells (DalCorso et al., 2014). ROS might be produced by free catalytic metal as Cu(II), Zn(II) or Fe(III) via the Haber–Weiss and the Fenton reactions or metabolic alterations (Letelier et al., 2005; Ravet & Pilon, 2013; DalCorso et al., 2014). The putative interaction of LEA proteins with metal ions suggests that they might prevent the deleterious effects caused by the accumulation of such molecules (Hara, Fujinaga & Kuboi, 2004; Liu et al., 2011). Previous works have reported interaction with Zn(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Fe(III), for CuCOR15 a member of group 2 from citrus (Hara, Fujinaga & Kuboi, 2005); ZmLEA3 a member of group 3 from maize (Liu et al., 2013) and GmPM1 and GmPM9 members of group 4 from soybean (Liu et al., 2011). Interestingly, GmPM1 and GmPM9 bind Fe(III) and Cu(II) but not Ca(II) or Mg(II) ions, and hence it is not clear if the metal binding and specificity is conserved in each group or if it is protein-specific. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the group 4 of LEA proteins is formed by three basic and hydrophilic non-redundant proteins: AtLEA4-1, AtLEA4-2, and AtLEA4-5, that have been classified as IDPs (Olvera-Carrillo et al., 2010; Shih et al., 2010). Their amino terminal region is highly conserved, whereas their carboxyl terminal region is more variable, with 54.64% sequence identity between AtLEA4-1 and AtLEA4-2, 29.69% between AtLEA4-1 and AtLEA4-5 and 26.09% between AtLEA4-2 and AtLEA4-5 (Fig. 1). It has been shown that two members of this family, AtLEA4-5 and AtLE4-2, undergo transitions to partially folded states, mainly alpha helices as determined by CD, under conditions that mimic low osmotic potentials or high macromolecular crowding simulated by different concentrations of glycerol or polyethylene glycol, respectively (Cuevas-Velazquez et al., 2016). Also, both proteins prevent the inactivation and/or the aggregation of enzymes under partial dehydration or freeze-thaw treatments (Reyes et al., 2008; Cuevas-Velazquez et al., 2016). Previous analysis showed that besides the characteristic amino acid composition of typical LEA proteins, group 4 LEA proteins present a particular bias towards a high content of positively charged residues (Arg and Lys) in their amino terminal region, whereas their carboxy terminal region show a high percentage of Gly and His residues (Fig. 1) (Cuevas-Velazquez, Reyes & Covarrubias, 2017). To gain insight into the properties of the Arabidopsis group 4 LEA proteins, we have characterized the metal binding by several biophysical techniques, such as CD, electronic absorbance spectroscopy (UV–vis), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In this work, we show that AtLEA4-5 is able to bind Zn(II), Cu(II), and Ni(II) but not Ca(II), Mn(II), and Fe(III), and describe the metal binding properties for this protein. MATERIALS AND METHODS. All reagents were analytic grade, and used without further purification. The water used was MQ grade. CuCl2 and CuSO4, MnCl2, FeCl3, CaCl2, NiSO4, and ZnSO4 were used as source of Cu(II), Mn(II), Fe(III), Ca(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) ions, respectively. PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. The AtLEA4-5/pTrc99A plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli D3-lysS strain (Cuevas-Velazquez et al., 2016). Bacterial cells were grown in 1 L of LB, supplemented with 100 μg mL−1 ampicillin at 37 °C. The recombinant protein expression was induced by addition of 0.3 mM isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside at OD600 = 0.6, and harvested by centrifugation after incubation during 6 h at 25 °C.

29912063,"Association of antiretroviral therapy with brain aging changes among HIV-infected adults. INTRODUCTION. Early diagnosis of HIV infection followed by initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has a clear clinical benefit in preventing the complications of HIV disease [1, 2]. According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines for the use of ART drugs in adults and adolescents [3], ART is recommended for all persons living with HIV (PLWH), regardless of their CD4+ T-cell count. Since currently available ART regimens do not cure HIV infection [4], ART should be continued throughout life [3] and therefore understanding the long-term consequences of ART is critically important. Certain ART drugs may cause chronic toxicity to parenchymal and vascular components of the central nervous system (CNS), contributing to neurobehavioral symptoms [5–16]. Although ART drugs are used in combination, individual ART drugs are associated with distinct adverse events. For instance, efavirenz use can cause acute and chronic CNS adverse effects [12, 13, 17] even though it is commonly used in combination with tenofovir and emtricitabine. Many ART drugs, even within the same class, appear to differ in their toxicity profile [16]. Experimental studies on ART drug toxicity have been conducted in cell cultures and animal models. Several cell types were used in cell-culture experiments [15], such as neuronal cells [7, 18–21], astroglia [22], oligodendroglia [23], endothelial cells [24–37], and vascular smooth muscle cells [35, 38]. Brown et al. [19] reported that efavirenz induced β-secretase-1 protein expression and promoted soluble β-amyloid production in murine N2a neuronal cells (transfected with the Swedish mutant form of human β-amyloid precursor protein [APP] gene) and in Tg2576 mice expressing Swedish mutated APP. Efavirenz exposure also reduced primary mouse microglial phagocytosis of β-amyloid peptide [19]. These experimental studies provide important insights into potential ART neurotoxicity. However, there have been limited clinicopathological studies using postmortem brain samples to explore associations between ART and neuropathologic changes [23, 39–41]. Regarding aging-related cerebral degenerative changes [42], Anthony et al. [41] reported an increase in hippocampal phospho-tau pathology (using AT8 antibody) in ART-treated PLWH compared to age-matched non-HIV participants. The same group [39] also observed markedly increased CD68-immunoreactive microglial activation in the hippocampus and basal ganglia in the absence of other significant neuropathologic changes in ART-treated PLWH compared to non-HIV participants. β-Amyloid plaque deposition, another aging-related cerebral degenerative change [42], was described in the cerebral neocortex [43–50] and hippocampal formation [41, 51] of PLWH in autopsy studies. However, the association between ART and β-amyloid plaque deposition has not been studied systematically. The potential effects of ART on cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), commonly associated with aging, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus [52], have been explored in few autopsy studies [14, 53]. A clinicopathological study of PLWH by our group [14] revealed an association between protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART and a higher risk of CSVD after statistically adjusting for diabetes mellitus. Similarly, an autopsy study by Morgello et al. [53] showed that PI-based ART was associated with more severe CSVD compared to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART. Taken together, aging-related cerebral degenerative changes have been observed in the postmortem brains of PLWH. Nonetheless, the occurrence of these changes in relation to specific ART drugs has not been strongly examined. In the present clinicopathological study, we aimed to analyze associations between specific ART drug use and aging-related cerebral parenchymal and vascular degenerative changes, including neuronal phospho-tau pathology, β-amyloid plaque deposition, microgliosis, astrogliosis, and CSVD [42, 52]. Our study focused on ART drugs included in recommended initial regimens in the DHHS guidelines [3]. We chose to examine parenchymal degenerative changes in the middle frontal gyrus and putamen because changes in brain metabolite levels in these brain regions on magnetic resonance spectroscopy were shown to correlate with cognitive impairment in PLWH [54, 55]. We hypothesized that use of certain ART drugs might be associated with aging-related cerebral degenerative changes among PLWH. METHODS. STUDY COHORT. We assembled 187 PLWH autopsy cases that were using ART drugs at the last clinical assessment in the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC, R432 and R458). The data on ART drug use were recorded within a median of 16.36 weeks (interquartile range 6.87−29.48 weeks, n=187) before death. The University of California San Diego Human Research Protections Program approved the project and all study participants provided written informed consent to participate. A written consent to autopsy was also obtained. The patients died between 1999 and 2014. The demographic data, potential covariates, and ART drug use are summarized in Table 1. Only ART drugs that were currently used at the last clinical assessment and included in recommended initial regimens in the current DHHS guidelines [3] were analyzed as predictors, including four nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI: abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [DF]), one NNRTI (efavirenz), four PI (atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, ritonavir), and one integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI: raltegravir) drugs. We tested associations between use of each specific ART drug and aging-related cerebral degenerative changes with reference to use of other ART drugs. Included as a separate predictor was ART penetration or effectiveness in the CNS estimated by using the CNS Penetration-Effectiveness (CPE) method [56]. We evaluated 17 biological covariates: age at death,",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,4896,far_neg_PMC,0.002741556,0

Chemokines (i.e., chemotactic cytokines) are a family of ~50 small, secreted proteins that act to orchestrate leukocyte migration through their interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [1]. However, it is becoming increasingly recognized that chemokines have roles beyond the coordination of cellular chemotaxis, and a number of chemokines have now been identified as antimicrobial proteins [2]. Antimicrobial proteins and peptides (AMPs) are small, cationic, and frequently amphipathic peptides that directly kill bacterial pathogens by interacting with and/or translocating across the negatively-charged bacterial membranes [3–5]. As nearly all chemokines are positively-charged at physiologic pH (i.e., chemokine pI values range from 8–12), a charge interaction is similarly thought to be an important factor for their antibacterial mechanism of action [2]. Importantly, several chemokines (e.g., CCL20, CXCL14, and CCL28) and other traditional AMPs (e.g., LL-37, Histatin 5, and β-defensins) possess the ability to directly kill fungal pathogens [6–11]. Though the antifungal mechanism of action for chemokines is less well understood, their antifungal activity is similar to that of the traditional antifungal AMPs (i.e., IC50 values in the low μM range) [5,11,12]. CCL28, also known as mucosae-associated epithelial chemokine (MEC), is a chemokine constitutively expressed in a number of mucosal tissues and is well-established as an important mediator of mucosal immunity [13]. CCL28 elicits cellular chemotaxis through interactions with two G protein-coupled receptors: CCR10, expressed primarily on lymphocytes, and CCR3, expressed primarily on eosinophils [14,15]. In addition to its chemotactic capabilities, CCL28 has been identified as a potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial protein with activity against bacteria, fungi, and protozoa [11,16,17]. Like other antimicrobial proteins, the antimicrobial activity of CCL28 has been shown to be highly salt-dependent, with even physiologic concentrations of salt (i.e., >50 mM NaCl) significantly disrupting antimicrobial efficacy in vitro [2,3,11]. Consistent with these findings, CCL28 is secreted at high levels in human saliva (i.e., 30–230 nM) and milk (i.e., 13–34 nM) [11], where salt concentrations are relatively low (i.e., 2–50 mM and 5–8 mM, respectively) [2], suggesting that CCL28 may act as an antimicrobial protein at these sites in vivo. Moreover, CCL28 is particularly effective against the fungal species Candida albicans, the commensal microbe and opportunistic pathogen abundant in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract, sites where CCL28 is abundantly expressed [11,14,18]. Previously, Hieshima and colleagues demonstrated that C-terminal domain of CCL28 (i.e., the last 28 amino acid residues) has considerable sequence homology to the salivary antifungal peptide histatin-5 (i.e., 32% sequence identity, 53% sequence similarity), and that a peptide consisting solely of CCL28’s C-terminal domain retains much of the in vitro candidacidal activity observed for the full-length protein (i.e., only a 2-fold change in IC50 value) [11]. Decades of structural studies have confirmed that chemokines share a common tertiary fold consisting of an unstructured N-terminal domain, 1–2 disulfide bonds, a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, and a C-terminal α-helix [19]. Though most chemokines have only 1–2 disulfide bonds, five human chemokines in the CC subfamily (i.e., CCL1, CCL15, CCL21, CCL23, and CCL28) have two additional cysteine residues capable of forming a unique third disulfide bond (termed 6C chemokines). The NMR solution structures of CCL1 [20], CCL15 [21], CCL21 [22], and CCL23 [23] have shown that the structural consequences of an additional disulfide bond for chemokines can vary. For example, the additional disulfide bond present in CCL21 exists within its unstructured C-terminal domain [22], and the additional disulfide bond present in CCL15 and CCL23 links the short helical region that precedes the first β-strand to the C-terminal α-helix [21,23]. The additional disulfide present in CCL1 links the first β-strand and the unstructured C-terminal tail, creating a unique structural region not seen in other chemokines [20]. Though Sticht and colleagues demonstrated that mutagenic disruption of the additional disulfide bond present in CCL15 minimally perturbs the structure, functional consequences were not investigated [21]. Overall, the structural or functional significance of the additional disulfide bonds in 6C chemokines remains largely uninvestigated. In this study, we investigate the unique structural features of CCL28 and their role in antimicrobial efficacy against Candida albicans. We present the solution structure of CCL28, solved by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The structure reveals that CCL28 adopts the canonical chemokine tertiary fold, but has distinctive structural features including an additional disulfide bond linking its first β-strand to its unstructured C-terminal tail. We find that CCL28 undergoes a pH-dependent fold transition near pH 5, a phenomenon that can be stabilized by the addition of 150mM NaCl. We show that mutagenic disruption of the additional disulfide bond significantly destabilizes the tertiary fold of CCL28, while removal of the C-terminal tail minimally alters the CCL28 stability. In vitro Candida killing assays with purified human recombinant CCL28 protein revealed that while the fold of CCL28 is necessary for in vitro chemotaxis [24], it is not necessary for direct fungal killing. Additionally, while disruption of the additional disulfide bond has a minimal effect on both in vitro GPCR activation and in vitro fungal killing, removal of the 28-amino acid C-terminal domain of CCL28 significantly reduces antifungal potency without altering CCL28’s capacity for GPCR activation. Finally, we observed a pH-dependence to the fungicidal activity of CCL28, with low pH enhancing CCL28’s an",PMC,pos,1,pos,4897,pos_PMC,0.9969126,1
29976570,"Crystal structure and pH-dependent allosteric regulation of human β-ureidopropionase, an enzyme involved in anticancer drug metabolism. β-Ureidopropionase (βUP) catalyzes the third step of the reductive pyrimidine catabolic pathway responsible for breakdown of uracil-, thymine- and pyrimidine-based antimetabolites such as 5-fluorouracil. Nitrilase-like βUPs use a tetrad of conserved residues (Cys233, Lys196, Glu119 and Glu207) for catalysis and occur in a variety of oligomeric states. Positive co-operativity toward the substrate N-carbamoyl-β-alanine and an oligomerization-dependent mechanism of substrate activation and product inhibition have been reported for the enzymes from some species but not others. Here, the activity of recombinant human βUP is shown to be similarly regulated by substrate and product, but in a pH-dependent manner. Existing as a homodimer at pH 9, the enzyme increasingly associates to form octamers and larger oligomers with decreasing pH. Only at physiological pH is the enzyme responsive to effector binding, with N-carbamoyl-β-alanine causing association to more active higher molecular mass species, and β-alanine dissociation to inactive dimers. The parallel between the pH and ligand-induced effects suggests that protonation state changes play a crucial role in the allosteric regulation mechanism. Disruption of dimer-dimer interfaces by site-directed mutagenesis generated dimeric, inactive enzyme variants. The crystal structure of the T299C variant refined to 2.08 Å resolution revealed high structural conservation between human and fruit fly βUP, and supports the hypothesis that enzyme activation by oligomer assembly involves ordering of loop regions forming the entrance to the active site at the dimer-dimer interface, effectively positioning the catalytically important Glu207 in the active site.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,4912,pos_MEDLINE,0.99723697,1

29990496,"Structure and Mechanisms of NT5C2 Mutations Driving Thiopurine Resistance in Relapsed Lymphoblastic Leukemia. SUMMARY. Activating mutations in the cytosolic 5’-nucleotidase II gene NT5C2 drive resistance to 6-mercaptopurine in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we demonstrate that constitutively active NT5C2 mutations K359Q and L375F reconfigure the catalytic center for substrate access and catalysis in the absence of allosteric activator. In contrast, most relapse-associated mutations, which involve the arm segment and residues along the surface of the inter-monomeric cavity, disrupt a built-in switch-off mechanism responsible for turning off NT5C2. In addition, we show that the C-terminal acidic tail lost in the Q523X mutation functions to restrain NT5C2 activation. These results uncover dynamic mechanisms of enzyme regulation targeted by chemotherapy resistance-driving NT5C2 mutations, with important implications for the development of NT5C2 inhibitor therapies. INTRODUCTION. NT5C2 is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed cytosolic nucleotidase involved in the maintenance of intracellular nucleotide pool homeostasis by promoting the clearance of excess purine nucleotides from cells (Allegrini et al., 1997; Banditelli et al., 1996; Hunsucker et al., 2005; Itoh et al., 1967; Pesi et al., 1994; Spychala et al., 1988; Tozzi et al., 1991). NT5C2 preferentially dephosphorylates the 6-hydroxypurine monophosphates inosine monophosphate (IMP), guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and xanthosine monophosphate (XMP), as well as the deoxyribose forms of IMP and GMP (dIMP and dGMP), facilitating the export of the resulting purine nucleosides out of the cell (Hunsucker et al., 2005). The importance of this activity for cell homeostasis is highlighted by the association of loss-of-function mutations in NT5C2 with hereditary spastic paraplegia in humans (Novarino et al., 2014). Yet, perhaps the most prominent role of NT5C2 in human disease results from the capacity of this enzyme to dephosphorylate and inactivate cytotoxic thiopurine monophosphate nucleotides –6-thioinosine monophosphate (6-tIMP), 6-thioxanthosine monophosphate (6-tXMP) and 6-thioguanosine monophosphate (6-tGMP)– generated by the incorporation of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), two thiopurine nucleoside analogs used in the treatment of lymphoblastic leukemia, into the salvage pathway of purine biosynthesis (Brouwer et al., 2005). In this context, somatic gain-of-function mutations in NT5C2 encoding proteins with increased nucleotidase activity drive selective resistance to chemotherapy with 6-MP and 6-TG and are recurrently present in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples at relapse, with a prevalence as high as 35–45% in early relapse ALL cases progressing under 6-MP chemotherapy (Ma et al., 2015; Meyer et al., 2013; Tzoneva et al., 2018; Tzoneva et al., 2013). Structurally, NT5C2 is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of Mg2+-dependent intracellular 5’-nucleotidases (Koonin and Tatusov, 1994) and functions as a homotetramer made up of a dimer of two tightly-associated dimers (Wallden et al., 2007). Mechanistically, the 5’-nucleotidase activity of NT5C2 proceeds via formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate mediated by three conserved HAD motifs in the catalytic center (Allegrini et al., 2001; Collet et al., 1998). Motif I, DXDX(V/T)(L/V), is most integral to the reaction mechanism, in which the first Asp (Asp52 in NT5C2) makes a nucleophilic attack on the phosphate of the substrate and the second Asp (Asp54 in NT5C2) donates a proton to the departing nucleoside. Motif II is a (S/T) residue (Thr249 in NT5C2) which stabilizes the phosphoenzyme intermediate, and motif III, K(Xx)D(X0-4)D, contains a highly conserved Lys (Lys292 in NT5C2), which also contributes to the stabilization of the intermediate by countering some of the negative charges. In addition, motif III contains Asp351 and Asp356 in NT5C2 which interact with an essential Mg2+ ion involved in the catalysis. Moreover, Asp54 in motif I also helps to coordinate the Mg2+ ion, while Met53 and Thr56 (motif I) are important for the correct orientation of all Asp residues. These elements define the structural components required for the catalytic activity of NT5C2. NT5C2 functions as a dimer of dimers, with the dimer being the smallest functional unit with enzymatic activity (Spychala et al., 1988; Wallden and Nordlund, 2011) and is regulated by allosteric activators with ATP, dATP and diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) as most the likely activators at physiological concentrations (Marques et al., 1998; Pinto et al., 1986; Spychala et al., 1988). The effector binding site of NT5C2 is located close to the subunit interface, with two ATP molecules binding back-to-back to each subunit of the dimer. Comparison of the basal (apo) and active (allosteric effector bound) structures of NT5C2 revealed a role of the Gly355-Glu364 region in the allosteric activation of the enzyme. This segment (helix A) is disordered in the apo inactive form of the enzyme and adopts an ordered α-helix conformation in the effector-bound activated state. This conformational change facilitates substrate binding and catalysis by inducing a rotation of Phe354 out of the active site and by moving Asp356 into the catalytic center (Wallden and Nordlund, 2011). The relevance of helix A in the activation of NT5C2 is supported by modeling studies implicating local conformational changes in this region as responsible for the increased nucleotidase activity of a strongly activating NT5C2 mutation mapping to this site (NT5C2 p.K359Q) (Tzoneva et al., 2013). Yet, the majority of NT5C2 mutations found in relapse ALL are located outside of this helix A region, suggesting that additional regulatory elements may be involved in the control of NT5C2 activity. However, these mutations show an apparent random spatial distribution in the structure of the enzyme and their mechanisms of action remain to be established. RESULTS.

30078642,"Structural Basis for the Acceleration of Procollagen Processing by Procollagen C-Proteinase Enhancer-1. SUMMARY. Procollagen C-proteinase enhancer-1 (PCPE-1) is a secreted protein that specifically accelerates proteolytic release of the C-propeptides from fibrillar procollagens, a crucial step in fibril assembly. As such, it is a potential therapeutic target to improve tissue repair and prevent fibrosis, a major cause of mortality worldwide. Here we present the crystal structure of the active CUB1CUB2 fragment of PCPE-1 bound to the C-propeptide trimer of procollagen III (CPIII). This shows that the two CUB domains bind to two different chains of CPIII and that the N-terminal region of one CPIII chain, close to the proteolytic cleavage site, lies in the cleft between CUB1 and CUB2. This suggests that enhancing activity involves unraveling of this chain from the rest of the trimer, thus facilitating the action of the proteinase involved. Support for this hypothesis comes from site-directed mutagenesis, enzyme assays, binding studies, and molecular modeling. INTRODUCTION. Fibrosis, an important pathogenic factor in diseases affecting most organs (notably heart, liver, and lung), contributes to up to 45% of deaths in the developed world (Rockey et al., 2015, Mehal et al., 2011). It is characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), in response to injury, infection, and inflammation, mainly in the form of collagen fibers. Despite the importance of fibrosis, currently there are no approved antifibrotic therapies. One approach is to control the deposition of collagen fibers by targeting their biosynthetic pathway. Among the 28 different genetic types of collagen in humans (Ricard-Blum, 2011), the so-called fibrillar collagens (types I, II, III, V, and XI) are synthesized in precursor form, procollagens (∼450 kDa), where the central triple-helical region is flanked by trimeric N- and C-terminal globular propeptides (∼50 kDa and ∼90 kDa, respectively). These are removed by specific proteinases, usually the bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1)/tolloid-like metalloproteinases (BTPs) for the C-propeptides (Vadon-Le Goff et al., 2015). The BTPs consist of an N-terminal astacin-like catalytic domain followed by several CUB (complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp-1) and EGF (epidermal growth factor) domains. which are important for substrate specificity (Wermter et al., 2007, Berry et al., 2009). The rate-limiting step in the assembly of mature collagen molecules into fibrils is the release of the C-propeptides (Kadler et al., 1987). In addition to fibrillar procollagens, BTPs act on other ECM substrates as well as growth factor precursors or antagonists, raising the possibility of off-target effects when using BTP inhibitors to control C-propeptide cleavage (Vadon-Le Goff et al., 2015). Some time ago Adar et al. (1986) described an ECM protein that accelerates the release of the C-propeptides from procollagen I by BMP-1 by up to 20-fold, called procollagen C-proteinase enhancer-1 (PCPE-1). This protein (∼55 kDa) consists of two CUB domains and a C-terminal NTR domain, where the intact CUB1CUB2 region (henceforth C1C2) is both necessary and sufficient for enhancing activity (Kronenberg et al., 2009). Previous studies have revealed that the role of PCPE-1 is specific for release of the C-propeptides from fibrillar procollagens, having no effect on BMP-1 activity for a range of other substrates (Moali et al., 2005, Petropoulou et al., 2005). This observation raised the possibility that PCPE-1 might be an attractive target for controlling BTP activity and hence the deposition of collagen fibrils in the ECM. Early observations showed that maximum enhancing activity occurs when the amounts of PCPE-1 and procollagen are approximately equivalent, suggesting that PCPE-1 forms a complex with the substrate (Moschcovich et al., 2001). This was later confirmed and the binding site localized to the C-propeptide region, with a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range (Vadon-Le Goff et al., 2011). Further studies by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) revealed that C1C2 binds to the stalk/base region of the free C-propeptide trimer, which has the shape of a flower (Bourhis et al., 2012a, Sharma et al., 2017), close to the site where it is cleaved from the rest of the procollagen molecule by BTPs (Bourhis et al., 2013). Also, kinetic studies have shown that saturating concentrations of PCPE-1, or C1C2, increase the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of BMP-1 by over 10-fold, due to a small reduction in KM and a ∼ 4-fold increase in kcat, using either procollagen I (Moschcovich and Kessler, 2016) or a shortened form of procollagen III (Bourhis et al., 2013). Despite these results, two questions remain. Why is the binding stoichiometry one molecule of PCPE-1 (or C1C2) to one C-propeptide trimer? And more generally, what is the molecular mechanism by which PCPE-1 binding enhances the activity of BTPs? Here we present the crystal structures of two forms of a complex between the active C1C2 region of PCPE-1 and the C-propeptide trimer of procollagen III. Together with site-directed mutagenesis, enzyme assays, binding studies, and molecular modeling, these results not only account for the observed stoichiometry but also provide a plausible mechanism for enhancement through localized unraveling of the procollagen trimer. RESULTS. Two forms of the complex were crystallized using the active C1C2 fragment of human PCPE-1 (Bourhis et al., 2013). For the first, C1C2 was complexed with the C-propeptide trimer of procollagen III (CPIII-His) where each chain consists of an N-terminal His tag followed by the entire sequence of the C-propeptide (245 residues) starting at Asp1 at the P1′ position of the BMP-1 cleavage site (Figure 1A). For the second we used CPIII-Long, which includes a 37-residue insert between the His tag and the C-propeptide of CPIII-His (Figure 1A). This insert consists of the last three Gly-X-Y triplets of the triple helix and the entire C-telopeptide sequence N-terminal to the BMP-1 cleavage site (Bo",PMC,pos,1,pos,4935,pos_PMC,0.99776566,1
30116565,"Crystal structure of a seven-coordinate manganese(II) complex with tris-(pyridin-2-ylmeth-yl)amine (TMPA). CHEMICAL CONTEXT. A variety of manganese(II/III) complexes have been studied as structural and functional mimics of superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes (Batinić-Haberle et al., 2010 ▸, 2014 ▸; Iranzo, 2011 ▸; Bani & Bencini, 2012 ▸; Miriyala et al., 2012 ▸; Policar, 2016 ▸). The efficacy of these mimics is reliant on their stability in aqueous solution, retention of open or substitutional coordination sites on the manganese ion, and MnIII/MnII redox potential lying in the narrow range of 0.2–0.4 V versus a normal hydrogen electrode (Iranzo, 2011 ▸; Policar, 2016 ▸). These factors are directly related to the nature of the ligands employed, their coordinating atoms, and the geometry of the coordination sphere (Policar, 2016 ▸). One family of manganese(II) complexes that has been studied incorporates N-centered, tripodal, tetra­dentate ligands (Policar et al., 2001 ▸; Durot et al., 2005 ▸; Ribeiro et al., 2015 ▸). These ligands can be readily synthesized to provide a variety of N and O donors that give rise to the structural diversity of their metal complexes (Policar et al., 2001 ▸). With that in mind, we have begun to examine manganese(II) complexes with tripodal ligands containing either pyridine or quinoline groups. Herein, we report the synthesis and structural characterization of [Mn(TMPA)(Ac)(CH3OH)]BPh4 [TMPA = tris­(pyridin-2-yl­meth­yl)amine, Ac = acetate, BPh4 = tetra­phenyl­borate]. This compound is prepared by a two-step process (see reaction scheme) in which manganese(II) acetate is reacted with TMPA in a methanol solution, followed by anion exchange with sodium tetra­phenyl­borate. The resulting monomeric complex exhibits notable characteristics including a high coordination number of seven, a distorted penta­gonal–bipyramidyl geometry, asymmetric bidentate coordination of the acetate ligand, and coordination by a methanol ligand. STRUCTURAL COMMENTARY. The title compound (Fig. 1 ▸), which consists of the [Mn(TMPA)(Ac)(CH3OH)]+ monocation and tetra­phenyl­borate counter-anion, crystallizes in the triclinic space group P . The manganese(II) ion is hepta­coordinate with a geometry that is best described as a distorted penta­gonal bipyramid. While this is a high coordination number for a first row transition metal ion, seven-coordinate manganese(II) complexes with N-donor ligands have been described previously (Deroche et al.., 1996 ▸; Policar et al., 2001 ▸; Lessa et al., 2007 ▸; Dees et al., 2007 ▸; Wu et al., 2010 ▸; Lieb et al., 2013 ▸). The TMPA ligand is tetra­dentate, with its central N2 and two pyridyl nitro­gen atoms (N1 and N3) in the penta­gonal plane, and the third pyridyl nitro­gen (N4) occupying an axial position. The remaining two positions in the penta­gonal plane are completed by the bidentate coordination of the acetate ligand (O2 and O3), while the final axial position is occupied by O1 of the methanol ligand. Distortion of the penta­gonal–bipyramidal geometry of the coordination sphere is produced by the bite angles of the TMPA and acetate chelate rings. For example, the N2—Mn1—N4 bond angle [75.20 (4)°] of the five-membered metallacycle spanning an equatorial and axial position, is significantly reduced from 90° (Table 1 ▸). This results in a trans O1—Mn1—N4 angle of 166.95 (5)°. Likewise, the O2—Mn1—O3 bond angle [54.74 (4)°] that results from bidentate coordination of the acetate ligand is significantly reduced from the ideal 72° bond angle within the penta­gonal plane. The O2—Mn1—O3 plane is also twisted outside of the the penta­gonal plane by approximately 10° as a result of weak intra­molecular C—H⋯O hydrogen-bonding inter­actions with neighboring pyridyl rings (Table 2 ▸). What is perhaps most remarkable about the bidentate coordination of the acetate ligand is how asymmetric it is. The Mn1—O2 and Mn1—O3 bond lengths differ from each other by 0.3005 Å. This does not appear to result from steric hindrance, but may be due to an inter­molecular hydrogen-bonding inter­action between the O2 acetate oxygen of one complex and the hydroxyl hydrogen of the coordinated methanol of another, having the effect of lengthening the Mn1—O2 bond. The bond between the manganese(II) ion and the central TMPA nitro­gen, Mn1—N2 is also considerably long at 2.4092 (13) Å. This elongation has been observed in other manganese(II) complexes with tripodal, tetra­dentate ligands (Deroche et al., 1996 ▸; Wu et al., 2010 ▸). The other Mn—O and Mn—N bonds fall into the range 2.2–2.3 Å, which is typical of manganese(II) complexes (Deroche et al., 1996 ▸; Policar et al., 2001 ▸; Lessa et al., 2007 ▸; Dees et al., 2007 ▸; Wu et al., 2010 ▸; Lieb et al., 2012 ▸). SUPRA­MOLECULAR FEATURES. Within the crystal, dimerization of complexes occurs by the formation of a pair of inter­moleclular O—H⋯O hydrogen bonds (Table 2 ▸) between the coordinated methanol of one complex and an acetate oxygen of another (Fig. 2 ▸) forming an (12) ring-motif inter­action. Within a dimer, weak π-stacking inter­actions between pyridine rings (Cg2⋯Cg3) can be detected. Separate dimers then undergo additional π-stacking between the pyridine rings of one moiety and the phenyl rings of a second (Cg1⋯Cg7 and Cg3⋯Cg4) as well as between the pyridine rings of separate moieties (Cg4⋯Cg6) [where Cg1, Cg2, Cg3, Cg4, Cg6, and Cg7 are the centroids of the N1/C4–C8, N3/C1/C9/C10–C12, N4/C14–C18, C22–C27, C34–C39, and C40–C45 rings, respectively] that further stabilize the crystal packing. In addition, weak slipped parallel C—H⋯π [C2—H2B⋯Cg6, X—H, π = 62°; C38—H38⋯Cg4, X—H, π = 61°; C42—H42⋯Cg3, X—H, π = 38°] (Table 2 ▸) inter­molecular inter­actions are also present and contibute additionally to the crystal packing.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of T lymphocyte subsets and platelet-specific autoantibodies on immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) with dexamethasone therapy. METHODS The samples were obtained from patients before therapy. T lymphocyte subsets were measured by flow cytometry, and platelet-specific autoantibodies were evaluated by modified monoclonal antibody immobilization of platelet antigen assay. RESULTS A total of 50 ITP patients were involved in the study. Twenty-three were anti-GPIbα antibody positive and were treated with dexamethasone, with a response rate of 47.8%. Twenty-seven cases were anti-GPIbα antibody negative, with a response rate of 77.8%. A significant difference was detected (p < 0.05). The level of CD4+ T lymphocytes in ITP patients was lower compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The level of CD8+ T lymphocytes was higher than that in the normal controls (p < 0.05). Additionally, the patients with a higher level of CD8+ T lymphocytes and lower level of CD4+ T lymphocytes were more likely to respond to dexamethasone treatment. Moreover, we observed that ITP patients associated with anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies had lower levels of CD4+ T lymphocytes and higher CD8+ T lymphocyte levels. CONCLUSIONS There was insensitivity to dexamethasone treatment in ITP patients who were anti-GPIbα antibody positive. The detection of T lymphocyte subsets is useful in ITP patients for forecasting the outcome of dexamethasone treatment. There were some relationships between the different antibodies and the levels of T lymphocyte subsets.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,4956,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0022694687,0

Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative bacterium and a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and sepsis [1], with highest incidence in infants and adolescents [2]. Glycoconjugate vaccines that protect against disease caused by meningococci serogroups A, C, W and Y have been available since the 1990s [3]. More recently, two vaccines have been developed to protect against serogroup B meningococcus (MenB), which is responsible for the majority of invasive meningococcal disease in developed countries. These vaccines are known as 4CMenB (Bexsero, GSK), which is made of three main recombinant protein antigens, NHBA, NadA, and fHbp, plus outer membrane vesicles (OMV) [4], and as rLP2086 (Trumenba, Pfizer), which is composed of two fHbp variants. Bexsero has been licensed in Europe, Australia, Canada, and Latin America for use in all age groups from 2 months [5]. Bexsero is a trade mark of the GSK group of companies. This study focuses on the 4CMenB antigen NHBA (Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen), also known as genome-derived neisserial antigen 2132 (GNA2132). The nhba gene is ubiquitous in meningococcal strains of all serogroups, and is also found in N. gonorrhoeae and other commensal Neisserial species (Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria polysaccharea, and Neisseria flavescens) [6]. The gene product is a surface-exposed protein of around 420–490 amino acids [7]. Over 400 different peptide variants of NHBA have been reported, which are mainly cross-protective [6]. 4CMenB contains NHBA peptide 2 (p2) as the N-terminal part of a fusion protein with an additional antigen, NMB1030, a ubiquinone-8 binding protein also known as NUbp [8, 9]. For this study, we focused on fragments and constructs of NHBA peptide 20. The NHBA protein has an N-terminal region of approximately 250 residues predicted to be intrinsically disordered, as previously reported [10] and calculated with Phyre2 [11], SABLE [12], PSIPRED [13] and JPred [14], and a highly conserved C-terminal domain (approx. 180 residues). Solution NMR studies of NHBA residues 245–427 (strain 2996, NHBA peptide p20) revealed a single 8-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel with a variably-positioned N-terminal extension made of an hairpin of two β-strands [15]. In a small central region between the N- and C-terminal regions, NHBA binds heparin and heparan sulfate through an Arg-rich motif [7], and this ability has been shown to increase bacterial serum resistance and epithelial cell binding [16]. Meningococcal NalP protease and human lactoferrin (hLf) are capable of cleaving NHBA upstream and downstream of the 10-residue Arg-rich region, respectively, [7] (Fig 1A). Upon cleavage by NalP, a C-terminal NHBA fragment is released and can alter endothelial permeability, likely contributing to the vascular leakage that is typically associated with meningococcal sepsis [17]. A study of antibody responses induced upon 4CMenB vaccination has been recently published [18], where a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (humAbs) from adult vaccinees was isolated, and antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were identified and produced as recombinant fragment antigen-binding domains (Fabs). Seven unique rearrangements were identified among the twenty-five humAbs specific for NHBA isolated from two immunized adult subjects, of which four recognizing the C-terminal β-barrel domain, two the N-terminal domain and one not showing appreciable binding to NHBA. Interestingly, humAbs binding to the C-terminal domain displayed higher binding affinities and were also more cross-reactive than those targeting the N-terminal region. Also, anti-NHBA antibodies contribute to serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) elicited by 4CMenB [19]. In addition to the original aim of increasing the structural knowledge of NHBA, the observations above prompted us to investigate the molecular bases for the recognition of conserved NHBA epitopes by cross-reactive human high-affinity antibodies. Here, we first solved the crystal structure of an NHBA fragment that reveals a previously unseen conformation of a 2-stranded ß-hairpin packing against the C-terminal domain. Then, we solved the crystal structures of the NHBA fragment 312–427 in complex with the Fab fragment of the humAb 5H2, and of the apo (unbound) huFab 5H2, revealing the presence of a large cross-reactive conformational epitope on NHBA and elucidating antibody plasticity that is required for binding to NHBA. Implications regarding the human immune response to the 4CMenB vaccine are discussed. MATERIALS & METHODS. NHBA133-427 AND NHBA312-427 CLONING, EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. Constructs NHBA133-427 and NHBA312-427, which include residues A133-D427 and M312-D427, respectively, were derived from NHBA peptide 20 (N. meningitidis strain 2996 [20] Uniprot Q9JPP1). The NHBA gene fragment encoding amino acids 133–427 was PCR amplified and then inserted, using the polymerase incomplete primer extension (PIPE) cloning method [21], into the pET-21b(+) expression vector (Novagen) to enable isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible expression. The construct was cloned after an MA (Met, Ala) sequence, added for cloning purposes, and was followed by a C-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag (residues LEHHHHHH) for purification purposes. The construct and NHBA gene fragment were confirmed in-house by DNA sequencing prior to protein production. The NHBA312-427 construct was cloned in a pET-21b+ vector (Novagen) and using a C-terminal His6 tag. Site-directed mutagenesis on NHBA312-427 DNA sequences was performed to produce seven mutants using the PIPE method. The resulting constructs were: R339A, R339G, K367A, R339A-K367A, R339G-K367A, T365A-D360A and E322A-E425A. The mutagenesis reaction products were transformed into chemically competent E. coli Mach1TM-T1R (Thermo Scientific). The expression of the NHBA133-427 and NHBA312-427 proteins was performed using Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen). In both cases, cells wer",PMC,pos,1,pos,4958,pos_PMC,0.9970421,1
30135580,"Structure of paused transcription complex Pol II-DSIF-NELF. RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcribes eukaryotic protein-coding genes and is controlled at multiple levels. When Pol II begins to elongate the pre-mRNA chain, its activity is regulated by elongation factors with positive and negative roles1. Elongating Pol II can be blocked2,3 or paused in the promoter-proximal region4,5. Paused Pol II is stabilized by two factors, the 5,6-Dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF), composed of subunits SPT4 and SPT5, and the negative elongation factor (NELF), composed of the four subunits NELF-A, -B, -C (or isoform NELF-D that lacks the first nine NELF-C residues), and -E6–8. Paused polymerase is released by the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which contains the kinase CDK9 and the predominant cyclin subunit CYCT19,10. P-TEFb phosphorylates Pol II, DSIF, and NELF11–13. DSIF and its homologs are conserved from bacteria to human, whereas NELF is generally conserved among metazoa8. Genes regulated by Pol II pausing often function during organism development or environmental responses14–17. Pol II pausing is also used by viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 to recruit viral factors such as Tat and to promote transcription elongation through P-TEFb3,10. The structural basis for RNA chain elongation by Pol II has been well studied18, but the factor-dependent mechanisms that regulate Pol II elongation are poorly understood. Our lab recently reported the structure of the mammalian Pol II elongation complex (EC) bound to DSIF19, and others reported a similar structure for yeast20. DSIF was observed to form DNA and RNA clamps around the Pol II upstream DNA and exiting RNA, respectively19. We also reported the crystal structure of a dimeric NELF subcomplex comprising the N-terminal region of NELF-A and the middle and C-terminal regions of NELF-C (NELF-AC dimer)21. Other regions of NELF are structurally uncharacterized, except for the small RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain of NELF-E22. It is unknown how NELF binds the Pol II-DSIF EC and how it stabilizes pausing. Here we provide the cryo-EM structure of the paused Pol II EC bound to DSIF and NELF (paused EC, or ‘PEC’) at a nominal resolution of 3.2 Å. The structure was determined on a DNA-RNA scaffold that bears the sequence of a well characterized promoter-proximal pause site3,23 found in the HIV-1 provirus. Our structure indicates that NELF uses several mechanisms to interfere with nucleotide addition and polymerase progression. Complementary biochemical data and comparisons with published results provide the molecular basis for NELF-dependent promoter-proximal pausing. STRUCTURE OF PAUSED ELONGATION COMPLEX. We purified endogenous porcine (S. scrofa) Pol II, which is virtually identical to human Pol II (Extended Data Table 1), and prepared recombinant human DSIF and NELF by co-expression of their subunits in bacteria and insect cells, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1a, Methods). We then investigated transcriptional pausing in vitro with the use of a DNA template bearing a pause sequence and a short complementary RNA transcript (‘pause assay scaffold’, Extended Data Fig. 1b, Methods). The sequence is well-studied in the bacterial transcription system and is known to cause pausing of mammalian Pol II24. ECs were assembled with the RNA 3’-end two nucleotides upstream of the consensus pause site. We found that Pol II briefly paused at the consensus pause site (+2 position) in the absence of factors, as observed before24 (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1e). Incubation with DSIF slightly suppressed pausing, whereas NELF alone had no effect on pausing or RNA elongation. In contrast, addition of both DSIF and NELF resulted in strong pausing at the +2 position and impeded further RNA extension (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1e). These results show that our recombinant factors can stabilize Pol II in the paused state. To determine the cryo-EM structure of the PEC, we assembled the PEC using a DNA-RNA scaffold that mimics the nucleic acid arrangement during human Pol II pausing on a strong HIV-1 promoter-proximal pause site23 (‘HIV-1 pause scaffold’, Extended Data Fig. 1c). This scaffold includes a hairpin in the exiting RNA known as the transactivation response element (TAR)3. A similar scaffold with a nearly identical template sequence recapitulates the effects of DSIF and NELF on Pol II pausing (‘HIV-1 transcription scaffold’, Extended Data Fig. 2). The PEC was assembled from pure components, isolated by size exclusion chromatography, and gently crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 1d). The cryo-EM structure was determined from 162,269 particles at a nominal resolution of 3.2 Å (Figure 2, Extended Data Fig. 3, Supplementary Video 1). The Pol II core extends to 3.0 Å resolution, whereas DSIF and NELF are resolved at local resolutions of ~3.5-8 Å (Extended Data Fig. 4, 5). We placed structures of Pol II, DSIF19, and the NELF-AC dimer21 into our densities and made minor adjustments (Methods). We then extended the NELF-C model by tracing into continuous density and modelled the helical subunit NELF-B into density with well-defined secondary structure (Supplementary Table 1). Density for NELF-E was largely lacking except for the N-terminal helix α1. The PEC structure was confirmed by chemical crosslinking (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 6, Supplementary Tables 2-3) and shows good stereochemistry (Extended Data Table 2). TILTING OF THE DNA-RNA HYBRID. The PEC structure adopts the closed Pol II conformation that has been observed in other EC structures18 (Fig. 2). The Pol II structure is highly similar to the previous Pol II-DSIF EC structure19 with the exception of a ~10 Å movement in the flexible RPB4-RPB7 stalk and a slightly altered trajectory of upstream DNA. DSIF domains are arrayed around upstream DNA and exiting RNA, with minor movements of the KOW1 and NGN domains (Extended Data Fig. 7a).

3020550,"On the spin trapping and ESR detection of oxygen-derived radicals generated inside cells. Recently several attempts to identify oxygen-derived radicals in whole cells by spin trapping and electron spin resonance have been reported by using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide as the spin trap. In the present study, the feasibility of this method is examined. Chinese hamster V79 cells and human erythrocytes served as the test systems, while OH radicals were generated by gamma radiolysis. Several spin traps were used to scavange the radicals and a distinction between exo- and endocellular ESR observable species was achieved using tri(oxalato) chromiate(III) as a line broadening agent. To distinguish between exo- and endocellular sites of radical formation, we studied the effects of high molecular weight scavengers (polyethylene glycols), which do not enter the cell. Various possible obstacles associated with trapping and detecting the radicals inside the cells were examined. The results indicate that the primary radicals react with the spin traps. However, these spin adducts decayed within the cells. Cellularly induced decay of 2-hydroxy-5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxyl radical presented the major difficulty in detecting the endogenous radicals, and potential experimental approaches to overcome this difficulty are discussed.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,4977,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0019877742,0

30232640,"Comprehensive assessment of cryogenic storage risk and quality management concerns: best practice guidelines for ART labs. INTRODUCTION. The cryopreservation of sperm, embryos, oocytes, and other reproductive tissues experimentally evolved in laboratory animals, domestic livestock, humans, and wildlife species as an effective tool for fertility preservation. To insure the short- and long-term maintenance of viable cryopreserved specimens, reliable cryostorage tanks capable of efficiently holding supercool liquid nitrogen (LN2) below −150 °C have been fabricated by creating a double metal container with an insulated, sealed vacuum air chamber between them. The traditional use of cryostorage dewar tanks of varying intermediate capacities (30–73–L), requiring manual LN2 level monitoring and filling, has expanded into the use of high-capacity bulk tanks (160–1000 L) with computerized monitoring and automatic filling systems [1]. For decades, animal reproduction and human fertility laboratories relied faithfully on the use of simple, dependable dewar tanks with only a rare occasion of reported tank failure. Anecdotal reports suggest most problems have arisen due to a complacency in quality control (QC) practices and a forgetfulness to refill or repair these ever-dependable vessels. If stored in obscure, low traffic locations, coupled with dependence on past reliability to maintain LN2 levels, these tanks are sometimes forgotten as an eternal cold chamber. Tanks can sustain extremely cold subzero internal conditions even when they seemingly exhaust the presence of LN2 under normal vacuum conditions, but shortly thereafter a threshold is reached with the nitrogen gas exhausted, and ambient equilibration occurs. The ability of cryogenic storage tanks to efficiently maintain LN2 temperatures below −150 °C, under very low liquid level conditions, is due to the contained supercooled vapor state. In turn, LN2 vapor (LNv) tanks have also been created to facilitate the storage of samples at risk of possible contamination, i.e., if submerged in liquid, as well as for the safe shipment of cryopreserved samples [2]. Most LNv storage tanks are reliant on auto-fill systems to maintain precious centimeters of liquid to preserve the viability of their specimens. The introduction of high-capacity storage tank systems (i.e., bulk tanks) has increased our reliance on working parts (e.g., solenoids, valves) and digital relay systems (e.g., temperature and level sensors, alarm systems). These devices are also susceptible to equipment failure or mismanagement that can result in catastrophic specimen loss if unusual sounds and events are ignored. Although relatively rare, several tank failures have been reported [2, 3]. The recently publicized failures that caused a catastrophic loss of over 4000 patient samples in a high-capacity auto-fill tank and the near loss of embryos and oocytes in a flawed manual-fill dewar tank in another facility, have heightened the awareness of patients, laboratories, and storage entities to the potential risks and liabilities of cryostorage. For all tank systems, a series of QC steps to monitor LN2 levels and refill tanks is necessary for proper cryostorage maintenance. Furthermore, emergency response and back-up planning is essential to ensure appropriate measures are taken to avert or minimize the effects of potentially serious cryostorage accidents. It was recently postulated that the frequency of moving and potentially mishandling tanks, by dropping or banging them, increases the risk of causing a damaging flaw, such as loss of vacuum pressure by puncture or compromise to welded seams and catastrophic failure [1]. This is potentially more problematic for the aluminum LN2 dewar and LNv dry shipper tanks. In practice, the large, steel stationary bulk tanks are a safer, more well-constructed storage system. Most reproductive laboratories, however, have found the smaller dewar tanks, typically 35–47–L, to be extremely reliable for decades and, based on space constraints, preferred to larger bulk tanks. The growing problem over cryogenic risk management is, in fact, multifaceted. How do we manage a growing population of aging tanks currently in use? Are newly manufactured tanks and monitoring devices as dependable as their predecessors? Are traditional temperature alarm systems adequate to prevent catastrophic losses? Are conventional quality control plans implemented by most IVF Labs sufficient to ensure complete protection from loss? Certainly, what is known is that all tanks will fail over time, but when? A new tank could fail to hold a full LN2 load for 24 h or less, while an older tank could efficiently hold its subzero temperature for decades without fault. The answer to uncertainties surrounding tank failures is the implementation of extensive, thorough, and innovative quality and risk management measures. The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively outline best practice guidelines for reliable cryogenic storage systems that minimize laboratory liability concerns and optimize patient security. ADMINISTRATION, CONSENTS, AND RECORD KEEPING. As the field of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) has developed, cryogenic storage practices have become a subspecialty warranting independent attention and consenting. This is particularly true of large laboratories or multiple laboratories owned by corporate entities. Once included in a standard embryo and oocyte informed consent form, the risks and benefits of on-site cryostorage, or potentially at an off-site long-term cryostorage facility, now require advanced consideration. There are several reasons for this. Many established programs are (1) running out of storage space, (2) unable or perhaps unwilling to change to high-capacity bulk tanks, (3) having a significant cross-border reproductive care patient population requiring advanced arrangements and payments, or (4) motivated to share or eliminate the liability of cryostorage maintenance with a third-party contractor. In all storage consents and agreements, it is crucial to inform patients that sto",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,4985,far_neg_PMC,0.0019154999,0
30242155,"Structures of insect Imp-L2 suggest an alternative strategy for regulating the bioavailability of insulin-like hormones. INTRODUCTION. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor system is an evolutionarily ancient, highly conserved, endocrine and paracrine signal transduction network in multicellular organisms. It regulates a broad spectrum of key life processes such as organism metabolism, somatic growth, development, reproduction and lifespan, and cell growth, differentiation and migration at the cellular level. In humans and many vertebrates, insulin is stored in oligomeric forms in pancreatic β-cells, and is acutely secreted in response to glucose and nutrients. It circulates freely in the blood after secretion with a short (~4 min) half-life. In contrast, human insulin-like growth factors (hIGF-1 and 2) are secreted by multiple tissues and do not oligomerise but are tightly bound in biological fluids by several IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1–6). Ultimately, insulin and IGFs exert their signalling through closely related tyrosine kinase type insulin and IGF-1 receptors (IR, IGF-1R)(Fig. 1). The occurrence of similar insulin/IGFs-like hormones (insulin-like proteins, ILPs), is very diverse in the animal kingdom, ranging from one insulin and IGF-1/IGF-2 in human, eight ILPs in Drosophila (DILP1–8), to 40 ILPs in C. elegans. Nevertheless, they share similar motifs of inter-/intra-chain disulphide bridges and organisation into B, C, A and D-domains, typical of insulin, pro-insulin and IGF-1/2 (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figure 1). The variety of types of ILPs is not reflected in the number of their receptors that is limited to one insulin receptor (IR, with IR-A and IR-B isoforms) and one IGF receptor (IGF-1R) in humans, to one IR-like in most invertebrates, including insects such as Drosophila (dmIR). The intracellular ILPs-signalling pathways—so called insulin/IGF axis—are well conserved in the animal kingdom, in contrast to the diverse regulations of bioavailability of these hormones. In humans, this involves six blood-circulating IGFBPs and the non-signalling IGF-2/mannose-6-phosphate receptor (IGF-2R)(Fig. 1). The ~213–289 amino acids long, three-domains human IGFBP-1-6 tightly regulate the level of free IGF-1/2 by forming binary/ternary complexes with these hormones. An understanding of IGFBP-1–6 was further convoluted by a proposed extension of the IGFBP superfamily by a number of cysteine-rich proteins, which homology to IGFBP1-6 is limited to their N-terminal IGFBP-like domain, with suggested IGFs affinities ~100× lower than of the true IGFBPs. These proteins were termed as IGFBP-related proteins (IGFBP-rPs), and they included Mac25 (temporarily renamed also as IGFBP-7), which cDNA was originally identified in meningioma. Subsequently, it was reported that the cells from the Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, used in baculovirus Mac25 expression secrete a binding protein, named Sf ILPs binding protein (Sf-IBP), that can bind human insulin, IGF-1 and IGF-2, with high nM affinities, and that it can interfere with the formation of human insulin:IR complex and its signalling. These and other findings revealed that the postulated IGF-binding properties of Mac25 actually resulted from the contamination of the expression media by Spodoptera endogenous Sf-IBP, being confused further by similar ~27 kDa molecular masses of these proteins. As the other members of the purported IGFBP-rPs family also failed to show any insulin/IGFs binding, there is now a common consensus that only the six classical, human IGFBPs-1–6 should be designated as IGFBPs, and that Sf-IBP may represent a distinct ILP-bioavailability regulating system (Fig. 1),. The cloning of Sf-IBP indicated its high homology to the 242 amino acid Drosophila imaginal morphogenesis protein-late 2 protein (Imp-L2) that is expressed during imaginal discs morphogenesis. The secretion of Imp-L2 is induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone, and is implicated in neural and ectodermal development in Drosophila, with Imp-L2 null progeny from Imp-L2 null mothers, showing 100% lethality. Imp-L2 can bind human IGF-1, IGF-2, insulin, and DILP5 with nM affinities, it counteracts insulin signalling in Drosophila being essential for resistance to starvation, while its overexpression leads to an extension of the lifespan. Therefore the aim of this work was to provide the structural insight into the invertebrate ILPs-regulatory IBPs-based system, and to assess its molecular relationship to human IGFBPs. Here, we report the crystal structures of the Drosophila Imp-L2 protein in its apo-form, and in holo-complexes with insect DILP5 and human IGF-1. They are supported by ITC and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) Imp-L2 binding data with human insulin, IGF-1, and DILP5, and size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) in solution studies of oligomeric states of this protein. The three-dimensional characterisation of the Imp-L2 IBP in its free and hormone-complex forms revealed its fold and hormone-binding mode that are entirely different from, and unrelated to, IGFBP-1-6. Hence Imp-L2 and, likely, other insects IBPs, represent an alternative macromolecular system for the control of the bioavailability of insulin-like hormones. RESULTS. STRUCTURE OF APO-IMP-L2. The apo-Imp-L2 consists of two, similar, immunoglobulin-(Ig)-like fold domains, each of them with two-sandwiched layers of ~6–7 anti-parallel β-strands. They contribute to an extensive, continuous β-sheet on the top-side of the Imp-L2 that is referred here as to inter-domain-β-sheet (id-β-sheet) (Fig. 3a). The N-terminal Ig-domain (1–142, referred here as to Ig-NT) is fused by a short linker to the C-terminal (145–242) domain (Ig-CT) (Fig. 3a). Although both domains can be classified as variants of the intermediate (I-set) subfamily of the Ig-fold they show significant variations from this structural motif, which likely reflects its adaptation to a novel organisation and function of the Imp-L2 (Fig. 3b). The β-strands of Ig-NT domain consist of two β-sheets: βA′-βG-βF-",PMC,pos,1,pos,4987,pos_PMC,0.99709344,1
30284668,"1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments of the intrinsically disordered SH4 and Unique domains of Hck. BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT. Protein kinases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to an amino acid side chain (phosphorylation) in specific proteins. Phosphorylation is used to activate numerous signaling pathways within cells, leading to cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and metabolic changes. The activity of kinases must be tightly regulated for proper cellular function. It is therefore not surprising that the human genome encodes over 500 protein kinases to execute this task in a controlled fashion. Among these, a group of non-receptor tyrosine kinases termed the Src family kinases (SFKs) has received considerable attention for the central role its members have played in the development of the field of tumor virology and subsequently in defining our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. The SFKs are comprised of nine highly conserved signaling proteins (Src, Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Blk, Hck, Fgr, and Yrk) with a similar regulatory mechanism. All of the SFKs function as molecular switches whose catalytic activity can be modulated in response to specific cellular signals, such as growth factors or cytokines binding to membrane-bound receptor proteins. Structurally, all nine members of the SFKs share a common multi-domain topology. The well-studied core of the protein is comprised of two regulatory “Src homology” domains (SH3 and SH2) and a kinase domain (SH1) capable of transferring phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues. Preceding the core is an intrinsically disordered region of low sequence conservation referred to as the “Unique” domain and a small membrane-anchoring SH4 domain located at the N-terminus that can be myristoylated or palmitoylated.[1] Interactions between the SH2, SH3 and kinase domains of SFKs have led to paradigm defining descriptions of interdomain allosteric regulation and represent a promising test case for structure based drug design. The SH4-U is often omitted from this picture, as it is typically removed in constructs designed for crystallization because of its intrinsically disordered structure. Recent NMR studies on Lck[2] and Src[3], however, suggest that this region is capable of mediating lipid-protein as well as inter- and intramolecular protein-protein interactions, and plays key roles in regulating the function of the kinases. Hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck) is a member of the SFKs notable for its critical role in Bcr/Abl-chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and its interactions with the HIV-1 accessory protein Nef.[4] The two dominant isoforms of human Hck are referred to as p59Hck and p61Hck. The longer p61 isoform contains an additional 21 residues at the N-terminal end (MGGRSSCEDPGCPRDEERAPR), and is derived from an alternate start codon of the same mRNA. Both isoforms may be myristoylated at the N-terminus but p59Hck can also be palmitoylated on Cys3. The variable acylation is thought to be a major determinant in localizations within the cell: p59Hck is mainly associated with the plasma membrane and p61Hck with lysosomal membranes. In at least one case the tumorigenic activity of Hck requires cooperative action of both isoforms, and despite their similarity, p59Hck and p61Hck are differentially localized and trigger distinct phenotypes when activated. Thus, a fundamental understanding of the SH4-U region is likely to lead to the discovery of new intermediate states and alternate strategies for inhibition of kinase activity for drug development. Here we present the NMR chemical shift assignments of both the p61 and p59 isoforms of HckSH4-U at low pH. METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS. CLONING, EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION OF HCKSH4-U. A synthetic gene fragment encoding residues 1–79 of human p61Hck was cloned into the NdeI and SalI sites of a modified pET28a vector containing an N-terminal TEV-cleavable His6 tag. The bases encoding the last glycine of the TEV site and the NdeI site were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis so that TEV cleavage of the expressed protein would yield residues 2–79 of p61Hck. To generate p59HckSH4-U the bases encoding residues 2–22 of p61Hck were deleted from the Hck.p61.4U construct by site-directed mutagenesis to produce the Hck.p59.4U expression plasmid. HCKSH4-U EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. A single colony of transformed BL21(DE3) E. coli was used to inoculate a 60 mL starter culture of 13C 15N labeled M9 minimal medium (U-13C glucose, 15NH4Cl) containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and a small aliquot of a resuspended multi-vitamin tablet in ddH2O (approximately 1/10th of a CVS Spectravite tablet per L of growth medium). Following overnight growth in a shaking incubator set to 37°C and 250 rpm, the cultures were scaled up by transferring 40 mL of the starter growth into 1 L of fresh medium. When an OD600 of 0.8 was reached, the culture was transferred to a 4°C cold room for 20 min, then grown at 18°C and 250 rpm for an additional 20 min prior to induction with 1 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested after 20 hours of growth post induction and frozen at −80°C for up to one month. To purify HckSH4-U, cells were resuspended in 30 mL of lysis buffer (20mM Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 20mM imidazole) with three EDTA-Free Pierce Protease Inhibitor Mini Tablets. The cells were lysed by three passes at 15,000 psi in an Emulsiflex C5 homogenizer, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 130,000xg for 50 minutes. The resulting supernatant was passed over a POROS-20 MC column charged with Ni2+ from which the protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 500 mM imidazole.

This work describes the UV alkoxylation of a series of 1,2-epoxyalkanes on the hydrogen-terminated silicon (H-Si) substrate. The formation of alkoxy self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and the nature of bonding at the surface of H-Si were examined using water contact angle goniometer, spectroscopic ellipsometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy. UV exposure to 1,2-epoxyalkane mesitylene solution for 60 min formed alkoxy-SAMs onto H-Si with hydrophobic properties. The local molecular environment of the alkyl chains transitioned from a disordered, liquid-like state to an ordered, crystalline-like structure with increasing the chain length. XPS and FTIR indicated that the reaction of H-Si with 1,2-epoxyalkane produced Si-O-C linkages. The Si-H bond homolysis and electron/hole were the plausible mechanistic routes for the grafting of 1,2-epoxyalkanes.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,5009,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0022872274,0
30326534,"[Bilateral Medial Recession for Infantile Esotropia]. OBJECTIVE Bilateral medial rectus recession (BMR) is a common surgical treatment of infantile esotropia with smaller and larger deviations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the dose-effect relationship and the success of the therapy. DESIGN The study is a retrospective, monocentric clinical study with one surgeon and 60 patients with infantile esotropia. METHODS 60 patients with infantile esotropia were included, who were treated with BMR using microinvasive technique between April 2012 and September 2015. We evaluated pre- and post-operative data in three follow-ups, at 3, 12 and 36 months. A residual deviation ≤ ± 10 PD (prism dioptres) at 12 month follow-up or a measurable positive binocular vision was defined as a positive outcome. RESULTS Age at surgery is 5.2 ± 4.6 (median ± SD). Pre-operative deviations at distance were 41 ± 10.5 PD and for near vision 44 ± 11 PD. Spherical equivalent refractive errors were + 2.25 dpt. Post-operative deviations at distance (n = 58) at 12 month follow-up were 6 ± 9.6 PD and at 36 month follow-up (n = 38) were 4 ± 10.5 PD. The mean reduction in deviation in 12 month follow-up were 3.08 ± 1.20 PD per mm and at 36 months 3.18 ± 1.27 PD. For children ≤ 4 years, the value was 3.93 ± 1.86 PD and for children > 4 years 2.81 ± 0.98 PD. The therapeutic success at 12 month follow-up was 67%. Positive binocular vision was proved post-operative in 62% of patients. CONCLUSION BMR is a long-term and efficient surgical treatment of infantile esotropia.

30400675,"Disordered Regions of Mixed Lineage Leukemia 4 (MLL4) Protein Are Capable of RNA Binding. 1. INTRODUCTION. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcribed RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides that do not code for translated proteins. The human genome is estimated to code for about 58,000 lncRNAs [1], that are being more and more recognized as central players in a plethora of biological processes. They can act as flexible scaffolds providing binding platforms for different proteins, they can interfere with other endogenous RNAs acting as microRNA “sponges” and they can modify chromatin state [2], thus regulating the expression of various proteins. LncRNAs have also been shown to play a role in several layers of epigenetic regulation: they are involved in DNA methylation and demethylation, they can modify chromatin conformation through binding to remodelers [3] and many of them interact with histone modifier enzyme complexes such as PRC2, coREST or SMCX [4]. The physiological processes where lncRNA regulation have been suggested involve cell cycle regulation, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) [5], cancer progression [6] and maintenance of cancer stem cells [5], hypoxia [7] and leukemia [8]. Various lncRNAs are shown to have altered expression levels in different leukemias, resulting in a crucial influence on cellular transformation [9], chromosomal translocation [10], apoptosis [11] and on drug resistance [12]. Accumulating evidence regarding the involvement of lncRNAs in leukemic processes prompted the suggestion to use them as prognostic and classification factors. It was found that lncRNA expression has prognostic value in AML patients [13] and multiple pathways were involved in lncRNA expression, including chromosome organization and trans-membrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signalling pathway. As lncRNAs are also considered valuable drug targets, it is essential that the molecular details of their functions are uncovered. Polycomb repressive complex (PRC2) is the most studied histone modifier that relies on lncRNA binding in its function, being able to bind several lncRNAs including HOTAIR, Xist, RepA, Braveheart, MALAT1 and MEG3 [14]. In vitro experiments revealed that not only EZH2, but other PRC2 subunits are also capable of lncRNA binding [15], thus providing a pattern of binding regions distributed along the surface of the complex. Even though there remain open questions regarding the specificity of the RNA binding by PRC2 [16], it is widely accepted that lncRNA binding plays a defining role in PRC2 targeting and the ensuing gene silencing [14]. It is interesting to note that despite the numerous experimental results that show EZH2 to be an RNA binding protein, it cannot be found in databases that list RNA binding proteins, furthermore no RNA binding site is predicted to be located in the region that is shown to be responsible for the RNA-protein interaction [17]. Apart from PRC2, other histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) or HKMT complex components also appear to bind lncRNAs with a relevant physiological outcome. LncRNA EZR-AS1 enhances EZR expression through recruiting SMYD2 to the upstream region of its promoter region and elevating the activating H3K4 methylation [18]. G9a interacts with lncRNA PARTICLE to regulate MATA2 expression upon mild irradiation [19]. The interaction was shown using ChIP assay and apart from G9a, the PRC2 subunit Suz12 was also pulled down. In a later experiment, it was found that PARTICLE can also interact with DNA methylase DNMT1 and that it increases H3K27 methylation as well as EZH2 expression. It was suggested that PARTICLE may serve as a functional platform that enables the specific targeting of chromatin modifiers, such as PRC2 [20]. WDR5, a component of the MLL1-4 and SET1a/1b complexes was proven to interact with lncRNAs NeST and HOTTIP with an effect on microbial susceptibility through the enhancement of interferon-γ expression [21]. Further investigation of the WDR5-HOTTIP interaction led to the recognition that lncRNA binding by WDR5 is essential in maintaining embryonic stem cell pluripotency [22]. However, not this work nor any previous studies investigated the possibility that the enzymatic component of the methyltransferase complex may also be capable of lncRNA binding. The family of mammalian MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) proteins consist of Set1a, Set1b and four MLL proteins, MLL1, MLL2, MLL3 and MLL4. They work in COMPASS-like complexes and catalyze H3K4 mono-, di- or tri-methylation, each complex having different specificity and methylase activity [23]. MLL3 and MLL4 are responsible for the monomethylation of H3K4 at enhancer regions [24] and has been linked to a high number of different cancers. Properly functioning MLL3 and MLL4 act as tumor suppressors [23], therefore mutations affecting their activity or stability can result in cancer development. Despite their central role in several types of cancers, many open questions regarding the regulation of the activity and the targeting of the MLL complexes remain unanswered. The exact molecular details of how MLL3 and MLL4 are targeting enhancer regions [23] as well as the specific molecular effects of the interactions of their different regulatory domains [25] are largely unknown. It is also worth noting that the known structured domains represent only 15–21% of the sequences of MLL proteins, leaving the vast majority of these proteins uncharacterized both structurally and functionally. In a previous work [26] we suggested that the disordered regions of HKMTs may harbor so far unrecognized interaction sites, adding more layers of the regulation of their activity. Based on the observation that many lncRNAs are involved in processes governed by HKMTs, we hypothesized that lncRNA binding might be one of the functions of these regions. Since multiple evidence point in the direction that leukemic processes are fundamentally affected by lncRNAs and MLL complexes are involved in this regulation, we concentrated on MLL proteins.

The exploitation of mineral deposits is followed by the formation of huge amounts of wastes, which have strong negative impacts on the surrounding environment. This paper presents the results of the compilation of data on general environmental problems in sites of waste disposal from mining and ore processing in Russia, based on the analysis of published data and own research. The own research of the authors relates to the estimation of the environmental hazards of mining waste using geochemical investigations and biotesting, as well as the development of the classification of technogenic mineral resources counting the reasons of the accumulation of precious components in them and findings on their environmental impact. The influence of waste disposal was determined as significant and diverse, leading to the transformation of all natural compartments surrounding waste disposal sites. The situation is especially aggravated when there are some mining and processing facilities within one relatively small territory. As a result, strong influence zones are formed. These zones have pronounced geochemical features reflecting the specificity of extracted rocks and produced raw materials. The analyzed information can serve as a basis for the development of nature protection measures for the mining waste disposal sites in Russia.

30420502,"Long-range regulation of p53 DNA binding by its intrinsically disordered N-terminal transactivation domain. Atomic resolution characterization of the full-length p53 tetramer has been hampered by its size and the presence of extensive intrinsically disordered regions at both the N and C termini. As a consequence, the structural characteristics and dynamics of the disordered regions are poorly understood within the context of the intact p53 tetramer. Here we apply trans-intein splicing to generate segmentally 15N-labeled full-length p53 constructs in which only the resonances of the N-terminal transactivation domain (NTAD) are visible in NMR spectra, allowing us to observe this region of p53 with unprecedented detail within the tetramer. The N-terminal region is dynamically disordered in the full-length p53 tetramer, fluctuating between states in which it is free and fully exposed to solvent and states in which it makes transient contacts with the DNA-binding domain (DBD). Chemical-shift changes and paramagnetic spin-labeling experiments reveal that the amphipathic AD1 and AD2 motifs of the NTAD interact with the DNA-binding surface of the DBD through primarily electrostatic interactions. Importantly, this interaction inhibits binding of nonspecific DNA to the DBD while having no effect on binding to a specific p53 recognition element. We conclude that the NTAD:DBD interaction functions to enhance selectivity toward target genes by inhibiting binding to nonspecific sites in genomic DNA. This work provides some of the highest-resolution data on the disordered N terminus of the nearly 180-kDa full-length p53 tetramer and demonstrates a regulatory mechanism by which the N terminus of p53 transiently interacts with the DBD to enhance target site discrimination.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,5038,pos_MEDLINE,0.9977787,1
30420606,"The entropic force generated by intrinsically disordered segments tunes protein function. ID segments can exhibit complex functions such as ligand binding, the scaffolding of multi-protein complexes and mediating allosteric regulation. However, many ID segments are assumed to be nonfunctional and are often removed from proteins to facilitate structural studies. For example, the 30-residue disordered C-terminus of hUGDH (residues 465–494) is often removed with no apparent impact on kinetic parameters. Here, we show that this C-terminal segment (called the ‘ID-tail’) plays a novel role in the allosteric mechanism of hUGDH. hUGDH catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of UDP-α-D-glucose (UDP-Glc) to UDP-α-D-glucuronic acid and is regulated by the allosteric feedback inhibitor UDP-α-D-Xylose (UDP-Xyl). Three hUGDH dimers associate to form an inactive hexamer (E*) (Fig. 1a, b). The binding of substrate induces an allosteric switch (T131-loop/α6 helix) in the E* hexamer to isomerize into the active state (E) (Fig. 1a, c-e). The allosteric inhibitor UDP-Xyl competes with UDP-Glc for the active sites, and upon binding, triggers the allosteric switch to produce the inhibited state (EΩ). This inhibition mechanism is atypical in that the active site also functions as an allosteric site to control the structure and activity of the hexamer (Fig. 1a, c-e). The EΩ state has a high affinity for UDP-Xyl and a low affinity for UDP-Glc. Because of this, the allosteric transition of the inhibited EΩ hexamer to the E state can be observed as cooperativity in substrate saturation curves. We compared the structure and activity of full-length hUGDH (hUGDHFL) to a construct lacking the ID-tail (hUGDHΔID). The structures of E* states of hUGDHFL and hUGDHΔID were solved in isomorphous crystal lattices and revealed no significant differences (Extended Data Fig. 1a-c). hUGDHFL and hUGDHΔID also have a similar kcat and Km for both substrate and coenzyme, consistent with earlier reports (Extended Data Table 2). In contrast, the allosteric response is sensitive to the ID-tail; deletion of the ID-tail reduces the affinity for UDP-Xyl by an order of magnitude (Fig. 1f). The fact that inhibited hUGDHΔID still binds UDP-Glc cooperatively shows that the deletion of the ID-tail reduces UDP-Xyl affinity but does not prevent the formation of the EΩ hexamer (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2a, b). Both the ID-tail and the α6 helix of the allosteric switch are located in the hexamer-building interface between adjacent dimers, suggesting that these two elements may work together to increase UDP-Xyl affinity (Fig. 1b). We used the allostery quenching A136M substitution to see if the ID-tail functions independently of the allosteric switch; this substitution has been shown to lock the allosteric switch and the hexamer in the low UDP-Xyl affinity, E state. Inhibition studies show no significant difference in UDP-Xyl affinity between hUGDHFL-A136M and hUGDHΔID-A136M, which suggests that the ID-tail requires a functional allosteric switch and the EΩ state to enhance the affinity for UDP-Xyl (Fig. 1f). The location of the α6 helix in the hexamer-building interface suggests that the oligomeric structure might be important for the function of the ID-tail (Fig. 1b). In fact, sedimentation velocity analyses shows that hUGDHΔID E* hexamer is slightly less stable than the hUGDHFL E* hexamer, which might explain the reduced UDP-Xyl affinity (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We tested the role of the hexamer using the M11 interfacial loop substitution, which prevents hexamer formation and stabilizes the dimer (hUGDHFL-dimer and hUGDHΔID-dimer). UDP-Xyl binds to the hUGDHFL-dimer with a 7-fold higher affinity than hUGDHΔID-dimer, which shows that the ID-tail enhanced affinity does not require the hexamer (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Information Section 1). The ID-tail is highly conserved in vertebrate UGDHs (Fig. 2a). We examined the importance of primary structure by randomizing the native sequence to create two distinct ID-tails (hUGDHR1 and hUGDHR2) (Fig. 2b). Surprisingly, the hUGDHFL, hUGDHR1 and hUGDHR2 constructs have similar affinities for UDP-Xyl (Fig. 2c). Next, all six prolines in the ID-tail were substituted with serine (hUGDH-Pro) (Fig. 2b). Because serine and proline both promote disorder, this substitution will conserve the unfolded state while disrupting any possible proline-specific interactions. Analysis of hUGDH-Pro shows that the prolines do not contribute to UDP-Xyl affinity (Fig. 2c). Since all of the above constructs conserve the positive charge of the native ID-tail (pI = 10.1), we created a negatively charged ID-tail (pI = 4.4) using lysine to serine substitutions (hUGDH-Lys) (Fig. 2b). Despite the charge switch, there is still no significant change in UDP-Xyl affinity (Fig. 2c). Finally, we show that the ID-tail can be replaced with polyserine (hUGDHSer) without significantly changing UDP-Xyl affinity (Fig. 2b, c). Thus, the conserved primary structure is not required for UDP-Xyl affinity but may have been selected for an additional, unrelated function in vivo (Fig. 2a). The absence of sequence constraints argues against any mechanism where the ID-tail specifically interacts with the inhibitor or the protein. Next, we considered the possibility that the ID-tail might enhance UDP-Xyl affinity through a sequence-independent interaction involving the polypeptide backbone. Because the 6 prolines in the hUGDHFL, hUGDHR1 and hUGDHR2 ID-tails sample 16 unique positions throughout the sequence without altering UDP-Xyl affinity, it is unlikely that a backbone specific interaction is important for function (Fig. 2b, c). Still, if there is a backbone specific interaction, then a plot of affinity versus ID-tail length would reveal a jump discontinuity when the critical segment is removed. Inhibition studies comparing hUGDHFL, hUGDHΔID, and three new constructs with varying length ID-tails (hUGDH2×FL, hUGDH0.5×FL, and hUGDH0.26×FL, hUGDH0.13×FL) show that the affinity can be modeled as a simple exponential decay (Fig. 2b, d).

30443360,"Structures of collagen IV globular domains: insight into associated pathologies, folding and network assembly. 1. INTRODUCTION. The extracellular microenvironment plays a pivotal role in tissue genesis, architecture and function. A defining morphological feature of these microenvironments is the basement membrane (BM), an ancient and specialized form of extracellular matrix that is conserved from cnidarians to humans. BMs underlie epithelia and endothelia (Hagios et al., 1998 ▸; Rhodes & Simons, 2007 ▸; Fidler et al., 2017 ▸) and ensheath muscle, fat and Schwann cells (Campbell & Stull, 2003 ▸; Sanes, 2003 ▸; Sillat et al., 2012 ▸; Court et al., 2006 ▸). BMs function as supramolecular scaffolds that compartmentalize and provide structural integrity to tissues, guide cell migration and adhesion, delineate apical–basal polarity and modulate cell differentiation during development (Hynes, 2009 ▸; Pastor-Pareja & Xu, 2011 ▸; Daley & Yamada, 2013 ▸). Type IV collagen is a major constituent of BMs. This evolutionarily conserved protein forms networks and plays a crucial structural role in the maintenance of BM architecture (Brown et al., 2017 ▸; Fidler et al., 2018 ▸). In addition, it serves as a ligand for cell-surface integrins, thus influencing cell adhesion, migration and differentiation (Wang et al., 2008 ▸). Not surprisingly, mutations in collagen IV cause BM destabilization and tissue dysfunction, and are associated with inborn defects such as Alport’s syndrome and cerebral haemorrhage (Hudson et al., 2003 ▸; Kuo et al., 2012 ▸; Gould et al., 2005 ▸). Furthermore, Goodpasture’s disease results from a selective antibody-mediated aggression to collagen IV, specifically to epitopes localized in the globular noncollagenous domains (NC1s) of collagen IV α-chains 3 and 5 (Hudson et al., 2003 ▸; Cui et al., 2016 ▸). These are two of the six types of collagen IV chains that exist in humans [designated α1–α6(IV)NC1s; in the following the (IV) will be omitted for simplicity]. The Goodpasture epitopes remain to be structurally characterized, but they are considered to be cryptic, becoming immuno-visible as a consequence of solvent exposure or viral infection (Pedchenko et al., 2010 ▸). These collagen IV-related disorders can be deadly as a result of impaired BM function. Unveiling how collagen IV is organized in BMs seems to be crucial in order to understand the molecular architectures of BMs and to clarify the pathogenesis of BM-related diseases. As previously mentioned, six different types of homologous polypeptide chains of similar lengths (1669–1712 residues) can be found in collagen type IV. These chains (α1–α6), encoded by paralogous genes, are composed of a short N-terminal domain termed the 7S domain (∼25 amino acids), a long central collagenous domain (∼1400 amino acids) and a non­collagenous globular C-terminal domain of around 230 amino acids [abbreviated as (IV)NC1; the (IV) will be omitted in the following; Timpl et al., 1981 ▸; Borza et al., 2001 ▸]. Three α-chains associate into a protomer with a long parallel triple-helical shaft and nonhelical ends. In the collagen IV network found in BMs, different protomers interconnect by end-to-end interactions. At the C-termini, interactions occur between the trimeric NC1 domains of two protomers, forming a hexamer of these domains reinforced by sulfilimine cross-links (Vanacore et al., 2009 ▸). At the N-termini, four protomers interact through their 7S domains, forming a 7S dodecamer reinforced by aldehyde-derived cross-links (Anazco et al., 2016 ▸). In this way, a combination of C-terminal hexameric and N-terminal dodecameric interactions generates the three-dimensional collagen IV scaffold to which other components of the BMs bind (Hudson et al., 2003 ▸; Brown et al., 2017 ▸). Intriguingly, only three distinct protomers, α1α2α1, α3α4α5 and α5α6α5 (abbreviated in the following as α121, α345 and α565, respectively), forming three distinct networks, α121, α345 and α121–α565, are known to occur in BMs (Boutaud et al., 2000 ▸; Borza et al., 2001 ▸; Gunwar et al., 1998 ▸). Previously unrecognized collagen IV α125 chain combinations have recently been found in various cancer cell lines, which form networks of protomers of α1α2 chains and α5-chain homoprotomers (Revert et al., 2018 ▸). The formation of these novel collagen IV networks is dependent on an exportable protein kinase, the Goodpasture antigen-binding protein (Raya et al., 1999 ▸; Revert et al., 2008 ▸, 2018 ▸), pointing to the involvement of the cellular machinery in regulating the organization of collagen IV networks. The assembly of the collagen IV network involves two distinct stages of α-chain oligomerization. Three α-chains first associate intracellularly, forming protomers, and the protomers then associate end-to-end outside the cell, generating extracellular networks. Hints on the assembly mechanisms were inferred (i) from the crystal structure of the α121NC1 hexamer isolated from natural sources (Sundaramoorthy et al., 2002 ▸; Than et al., 2002 ▸; Vanacore et al., 2004 ▸), (ii) from the ability of recombinant α1NC1 chains to selectively assemble into hexamers (Boutaud et al., 2000 ▸) and (iii) from refolding experiments with NC1 hexamers (Dölz et al., 1988 ▸). Recent studies in one of our laboratories (Cummings et al., 2016 ▸) revealed that the NC1 domains function as recognition modules, directing the selection and assembly of α-chains into protomers and networks. In turn, chloride ions activate a molecular switch present in NC1 domains that triggers the oligomerization of protomers into networks. However, how NC1 recognition modules direct α-chain oligomerization has so far been ignored. To obtain further insight into collagen IV network assembly and to advance the characterization of the molecular bases of Goodpasture’s and Alport’s syndromes, we generated various NC1 domains via recombinant technology and used protein crystallography to identify and structurally characterize the oligomers produced by these domains.

30540945,"Cryo-EM Structures of Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus Reveal Mechanisms of Virus Disassembly and Antibody Neutralization. SUMMARY. Alphaviruses are enveloped pathogens that cause arthritis and encephalitis. Here, we report a 4.4-Å cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), an alphavirus that causes fatal encephalitis in humans. Our analysis provides insights into viral entry into host cells. The envelope protein E2 showed a binding site for the cellular attachment factor heparan sulfate. The presence of a cryptic E2 glycan suggests how EEEV escapes surveillance by lectin-expressing myeloid lineage cells, which are sentinels of the immune system. A mechanism for nucleocapsid core release and disassembly upon viral entry was inferred based on pH changes and capsid dissociation from envelope proteins. The EEEV capsid structure showed a viral RNA genome binding site adjacent to a ribosome binding site for viral genome translation following genome release. Using five Fab-EEEV complexes derived from neutralizing antibodies, our investigation provides insights into EEEV host cell interactions and protective epitopes relevant to vaccine design. INTRODUCTION. Alphaviruses are arthropod-transmitted enveloped pathogens that cause epidemics in humans and other vertebrate animals (Jose et al., 2009, Schwartz and Albert, 2010, Strauss and Strauss, 1994). Alphaviruses have an ∼12-kb unsegmented single-stranded (+)RNA genome that encodes four non-structural and five structural proteins (Strauss and Strauss, 1994). The icosahedral shell of alphaviruses consists of an outer layer of trans-membrane envelope E1 and E2 proteins and an inner capsid layer separated by a host-derived membrane. Previous cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of chikungunya (CHIKV), Semliki Forest (SFV), Sindbis (SINV), Ross River (RRV), Venezuelan (VEEV), and western equine encephalitis (WEEV) viruses have shown that the E1 and E2 proteins are organized into 20 icosahedral 3-fold and 60 quasi-3-fold trimeric spikes (Kostyuchenko et al., 2011, Mancini et al., 2000, Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006, Sherman and Weaver, 2010, Smith et al., 1995, Sun et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2011). Crystallographic structures of the E1 and E2 ectodomains and the capsid C-terminal domain (CTD) also have been determined for several alphaviruses (Choi et al., 1991, Gibbons et al., 2004, Lescar et al., 2001, Li et al., 2010, Voss et al., 2010). The capsid N-terminal domain (NTD) is disordered and binds the negatively charged alphavirus RNA genome (Owen and Kuhn, 1996). Alphaviruses utilize the E2 protein for attachment to incompletely characterized receptors (Schwartz and Albert, 2010, Zhang et al., 2018). Alphaviruses are internalized by endocytosis (Figure S1). Endosome acidification triggers conformational changes in the E1 and E2 proteins that generate the fusogenic conformation of the E1 protein (Gibbons et al., 2004, Haag et al., 2002). Viral-endosomal membrane fusion is followed by the release of the nucleocapsid (NC) core into the host cytosol for initiation of viral replication (Haag et al., 2002). Structural investigations of alphaviruses have concentrated mainly on arthritogenic alphaviruses (Kostyuchenko et al., 2011, Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006, Smith et al., 1995, Sun et al., 2013, Tang et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 2005). In contrast, structural information on encephalitic alphaviruses is limited (Porta et al., 2014, Sherman and Weaver, 2010, Zhang et al., 2011). Encephalitic alphaviruses are considered potential biological weapons, as virus particles can be dispersed as aerosols to initiate infections (Roy et al., 2009). Severe neurological disease is associated with infections of eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), which causes up to 70% fatality rates in symptomatic cases (Armstrong and Andreadis, 2013, Villari et al., 1995). Outbreaks of EEEV have been reported in recent years in the eastern parts of the United States and in Panama (Carrera et al., 2013, Silverman et al., 2013). To gain insight into the molecular organization of encephalitic alphaviruses, we determined a cryo-EM structure of an EEEV virion derived from a SINV-EEEV chimeric virus to a resolution varying from 3.5 to 6.5 Å, corresponding to an average resolution of 4.4 Å. This structure provides information about EEEV entry into host cells (steps 1–4 in Figure S1). Structures of previously reported sequences of a genome binding site (Owen and Kuhn, 1996) and a ribosome binding site (RBS) (Wengler et al., 1992) were observed on the capsid protein. The EEEV cryo-EM map also revealed a binding site for heparan sulfate (HS), which has been linked to viral neurovirulence and avoidance of lymphotropism (Gardner et al., 2011, Gardner et al., 2013). The cryo-EM analysis of EEEV, quantitative glycan analysis, and virus internalization assays provide mechanistic insights into an evasion mechanism by which EEEV inefficiently enters into myeloid lineage cells including macrophages and dendritic cells. Cryo-EM structures of EEEV complexed with Fab fragments from five potently neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provided insights into host cell entry and neutralization. RESULTS. The EEEV cryo-EM map shows overall conservation of structural features among alphaviruses (Figures 1A, 1B, S2, and S3A–S3D; Tables S1 and S2). The E1 ectodomain is divided into domains I, II (responsible for fusion), and III. The E2 ectodomain consists of domains A (putative receptor-binding), B (putative receptor-binding and protection of fusion loop), C, D, and a β-ribbon connector (Li et al., 2010, Voss et al., 2010) (Figures 1C–1E). The EEEV E1 and E2 ectodomains are stabilized by disulfide bonds (Figures S3E and S3F).

30547821,"X-ray irradiation induced Disabled-2 gene promoter de-methylation enhances radiosensitivity of non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells. BACKGROUND. Abnormal Wnt/Wingless signaling pathway activation has been reported in many cancers and is supposed to promote proliferation, invasion, and metastasis [1, 2]. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is active during embryogenesis facilitating new organism formation. Normally, it is down-regulated in differentiated cells, however, the deregulated Wnt signaling is correlated with almost all stages of oncogenesis, from malignant transformation to metastatic dissemination and resistance to treatment [3, 4], it also induces radioresistance in several human cancers including head and neck, breast, nasopharyngeal, esophageal, glioblastoma, and colorectal cancers [5]. Abnormalities of Wnt components such as: mutation in β-catenin or APC gene, overexpression of Wnt ligands, loss of inhibition of regulatory could induce the activity and stimulates expression of downstream genes, such as: cyclin D1 and c-myc, matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), connexin 42, CD44, claudin-1 and so on [6–9]. The overexpression of its downstream targets is correlated with the alteration of cell cycle progression, proliferation, invasiveness, Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer stem cells (CSCs) and contribute to tumorigenesis [6–9]. Disabled-2 (Dab2) is a member of the Mammalian/Drosophila disabled gene family, which can stabilizes Axin and serves as an inhibitor of the Wnt pathway [10–14]. Lung cancer is now the leading cause of malignant tumor related deaths in China and the rest of the world [15, 16]. We previously reported that the Wnt signaling pathway is abnormally activated in lung cancer due to decreased expression of Dab2 and Axin, which inhibits the degradation of β-catenin resulting in its accumulation in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This accumulation of β-catenin then activates the target genes of the Wnt pathway, such as cyclin D1, MMP-7 and c-myc. We also have previously found that hypermethylation of the Dab2 gene promoter was correlated with reduced expression in lung cancer [17–19]. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of lung cancer cases. Radiotherapy is an important treatment for lung cancer patients, especially for patients who are not suitable for surgery. However, it is well known that lung cancers from different patients may display different degrees of radiosensitivity. Interestingly, X-ray irradiation has been shown to induce demethylation of the whole genome by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) [20–25], which raise the possibility that X-ray irradiation might inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation and invasion via demethylation-mediated up-regulation of the Dab2 gene. In order to confirm our hypothesis, we assessed the methylation status of the Dab2 gene promoter and investigated its transcriptional expression after irradiation. In addition, we studied the effects of X-ray irradiation on expression of DNMTs, Wnt pathway factors, the methylation status of the Dab2 gene, as well as associated changes in cell proliferation, invasiveness, and tumor progression by in vitro and in vivo experiments. METHODS. LUNG CANCER TISSUE SAMPLES AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY. A total of 137 lung cancer tissue samples, including 63 squamous cell carcinoma and 74 adenocarcinoma cases, and the corresponding normal lung tissues were obtained randomly from patients who underwent surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University between 2009 and 2011. The follow-up study lasted for 60 months (4–60 months, average follow-up time 30.65 months). Patients included in the study ranged from 32 to 82 years of age (mean, 59 years), and were composed of 77 males and 60 females. These tumors showed different degrees of differentiation and were classified as well (n = 30), moderately (n = 67), or poorly (n = 40) differentiated. 65 cases exhibited lymph node metastasis. The tumor stage was classified according to the TNM classification system of the International Union Against Cancer as stage I (57 cases), stage II (52 cases), and stage III (28 cases). The study was conducted according to the regulations stipulated by the institutional review board at the China Medical University and complied with Declaration of Helsinki. Sections were immunostained with polyclonal rabbit anti-Dab2 antibody (1400; Abcam Biotechnology Inc., Cambridge, MA), at 4 °C overnight. Antibodies were detected by the streptavidin-peroxidase method. The immunostained slides were reviewed by 2 pathologists who were blinded to the clinical data. Five fields of view per slide were randomly examined at 400× magnification. The positive rate of each case was obtained by calculating the percentage of positively stained cells on each slide. Percentages were scored as (1) 1 to 25%, (2) 26 to 50%, (3) 51 to 75%, or (4) 76 to 100%. The intensity of Dab2 staining was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (strong). The two scores were multiplied to give a final score from 0 to 12. The overall expression of Dab2 in these tumors was then defined as low expression (< 5) and high expression (≥5). CELL CULTURE AND X-RAY TREATMENT. Four cell lines of NSCLC, including LTEP-a-2 (LTE, adenocarcinoma), and NCI-H460 (H460, large cell carcinoma), obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA); SPC-A-1 (SPC, adenocarcinoma) and LK2 (LK, squamous carcinoma) cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy (Shanghai, China). Plastic flasks with lung cancer cells were treated with X-ray irradiation using a linear accelerator (Primus, Siemens, Germany) with a dose of 2Gy and 4Gy. X-ray irradiation was delivered soon after the cell density reached 70–80%, and a non-irradiated lung cancer cell line was used as control. After irradiation, the cells were harvested at the appropriate time points and stored in a freezer (− 80 °C) before being processed for further analysis.

30575273,"Cell-free DNA as a biomarker of aging. 1. INTRODUCTION. During the last century, human life expectancy has more than doubled, resulting in a large worldwide increase in the elderly population: The number of individuals aged 80 or over is projected to triple by 2050 and to increase to nearly seven times by 2100 (United Nations, 2017), and the number of centenarians is also expected to increase globally. Because increased longevity does not necessarily translate into increased healthspan, improving the latter is an urgent priority. Hence, biomarkers of aging that can be translated to the clinical setting are of particular interest. Several aging biomarkers such as C‐reactive protein and insulin‐like growth factor‐1 have been identified as predictive for mortality (Castagne et al., 2018). The identification of circulating biomarkers is of increasing interest in the study of human aging, especially when these biomarkers are applied to the measurement of biological age (Capri et al., 2015). Recent data showed that subjects of the same chronological age, including centenarians, can have younger or older biological ages that, in turn, are associated with morbidity and mortality (Chen et al., 2016). Among the different biomarkers that have been proposed, which include DNA methylation and N‐glycans (Horvath, 2013; Miura & Endo, 2016), cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) appears particularly promising due to the ease of collecting specimens and the ever‐decreasing costs of genomic sequencing. However, little is known about how cfDNA changes with age. High levels of cfDNA were first reported in 1966 in the circulating serum of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (Tan, Schur, Carr, & Kunkel, 1966) and were later discovered in the plasma of cancer patients (Stroun, Anker, Lyautey, Lederrey, & Maurice, 1987). cfDNA originates primarily from cell death through apoptosis or necrosis (van der Vaart & Pretorius, 2007), and recently, new methods have been developed to trace the tissues of origin of cfDNA through nucleosome positioning and methylation footprints (Lehmann‐Werman et al., 2016; Snyder, Kircher, Hill, Daza, & Shendure, 2016). These methodologies allow the detection of tissue‐specific damage or disease through liquid biopsies. The aging process is associated with cellular stress and is accompanied by alterations to the number of apoptotic cells and DNA release (Jylhava et al., 2013; Pollack, Phaneuf, Dirks, & Leeuwenburgh, 2002). Older individuals were reported to exhibit higher levels of circulating cfDNA (Jylhava et al., 2011), including mitochondrial DNA (cf‐mtDNA) (Pinti et al., 2014). Aging is also associated with chronic systemic inflammation or inflammaging. The cause of this phenomenon in older individuals may come from different sources, one of which is the increased number of senescent cells that can secrete senescence‐associated secretory phenotype factors to drive inflammation (Franceschi & Campisi, 2014). Other factors such as age‐associated accumulation of metabolites or cell debris, including self and non‐self‐nucleic acids (Franceschi, Garagnani, Vitale, Capri, & Salvioli, 2017), can act as damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that trigger immune response and subsequent inflammation (Franceschi & Campisi, 2014). For instance, high level of total cfDNA in nonagenarians is associated with systemic inflammation and frailty (Jylhava et al., 2013). cfDNA has also been shown to be one of the triggers to adipocyte inflammation in obese mice due to the increased cell death in fat tissues (Nishimoto et al., 2016). In this study, we used cfDNA to characterize the nucleosome landscape and the contributing tissues of age‐associated cell death. We performed whole‐genome sequencing on cfDNA collected from the plasma of individuals in four groups composed of young, old, and two cohorts of centenarians (divided into healthy and unhealthy populations). 2. RESULTS. 2.1. PROFILING OF CFDNA AT DIFFERENT AGES AND IN EXTREME LONGEVITY. Aging is known to be associated with increased cell death, which may contribute to a change in the cfDNA released into circulation. Hence, we profiled cfDNA extracted from a total of 12 individuals from different ages and health conditions. Specifically, we performed whole‐genome sequencing of cfDNA from three 25‐year‐old ± 0.5 (SD) subjects (referred to as young), three 71‐year‐old ± 1.6 subjects (referred to as old), and six 101.8‐year‐old ± 1.1 centenarians (Supporting Information Tables S1 and S2). The centenarian cohort was further divided into two groups: three healthy and three unhealthy individuals. Healthy centenarians were characterized as having good cognitive performance, that is, SMMSE (Standardized Mini‐Mental State Examination) > 24 scores, retaining the ability to walk, and having a high ADL (Activities of Daily Living) score (Supporting Information Table S1). In contrast, unhealthy centenarians had dementia, were not able to perform the SMMSE, and were bedridden. In addition, the two centenarian cohorts showed significant differences in 5 out of 32 hemato‐biochemical parameters tested: RBC, HGB, HCT, ALB, and HDL (Supporting Information Table S5). 2.2. CELL‐FREE DNA REVEALS IN VIVO NUCLEOSOME LANDSCAPE CHANGES WITH AGE. The analysis of the fragment length of cfDNA derived from blood plasma showed an enrichment of 166‐ to 175‐bp fragments (Figure 1a, Supporting Information Table S3), which corresponds to the length of a chromatosome. In healthy individuals, most of these cfDNA fragments originate from apoptotic cells of hematopoietic origin (Lo et al., 2010). Several studies have demonstrated that the fragmentation patterns of cfDNA can reveal the nucleosome landscape of dead cells from which the cfDNA is derived. This is because DNA wrapped around the histone octamers and linker histones is protected from digestion during apoptosis (Ivanov, Baranova, Butler, Spellman, & Mileyko, 2015; Snyder et al., 2016). We used DANPOS2 to identify the cfDNA signals and to define the nucleosome landscape",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,5074,far_neg_PMC,0.002969445,0
30590046,"A Protective Monoclonal Antibody Targets a Site of Vulnerability on the Surface of Rift Valley Fever Virus. SUMMARY. The Gn subcomponent of the Gn-Gc assembly that envelopes the human and animal pathogen, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), is a primary target of the neutralizing antibody response. To better understand the molecular basis for immune recognition, we raised a class of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) against RVFV Gn, which exhibited protective efficacy in a mouse infection model. Structural characterization revealed that these nAbs were directed to the membrane-distal domain of RVFV Gn and likely prevented virus entry into a host cell by blocking fusogenic rearrangements of the Gn-Gc lattice. Genome sequence analysis confirmed that this region of the RVFV Gn-Gc assembly was under selective pressure and constituted a site of vulnerability on the virion surface. These data provide a blueprint for the rational design of immunotherapeutics and vaccines capable of preventing RVFV infection and a model for understanding Ab-mediated neutralization of bunyaviruses more generally. INTRODUCTION. First reported in 1931 (Daubney et al., 1931), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus endemic to Africa and the Arabian peninsula that causes recurrent epidemics and epizootics. RVFV is of both agricultural and biomedical importance, as infection of livestock results in high incidences of neonatal mortality and zoonosis; human disease ranges from mild self-limiting febrile illness to severe disease characterized by hemorrhagic diatheses, encephalitis, and ocular pathologies (Al-Hazmi et al., 2003, Mohamed et al., 2010, Sow et al., 2014). Human populations throughout East Africa are at high risk for RVFV infection, with seroprevalence reported to exceed 8% in communities located near water reservoirs that support mosquito populations (Pourrut et al., 2010). No licensed antivirals or vaccines for RVFV are currently available, although a number of vaccine candidates are in development (Dungu et al., 2018, Faburay et al., 2017). The genetically diverse group of viruses within the genus Phlebovirus, family Phenuiviridae, currently contains ten species (Adams et al., 2017). Like all known phleboviruses, RVFV is enveloped and contains a single-stranded, negative- or ambi-sense RNA genome that is divided into three segments: S, M, and L. The M segment encodes the glycoprotein precursor, which is processed into two membrane-anchored glycoproteins, Gn and Gc (Gerrard and Nichol, 2007). While the phleboviral Gc forms a class II fusion architecture observed in a number of viral families (Dessau and Modis, 2013, Guardado-Calvo et al., 2017, Halldorsson et al., 2016, Vaney and Rey, 2011, Zhu et al., 2017), the multi-domain phleboviral Gn is structurally distinct and exhibits partial secondary structure similarity with the Gn of hantaviruses and the E1 of alphaviruses (Guardado-Calvo and Rey, 2017, Halldorsson et al., 2018, Li et al., 2016, Rissanen et al., 2017, Voss et al., 2010, Wu et al., 2017). In contrast to the phleboviral Gc, which is structurally well conserved, studies of RVFV Gn and SFTSV Gn have revealed that the phleboviral Gn maintains a low level of structural conservation across the family (approximately 3 Å root-mean-square deviation [RMSD]) (Wu et al., 2017). Heterodimers of RVFV Gn and Gc form pentameric and hexameric assemblies on the virion surface in an icosahedral T = 12 organization (Freiberg et al., 2008, Halldorsson et al., 2018, Sherman et al., 2009). Structural studies localize the N-terminal domains of RVFV Gn to the membrane-distal region and have proposed that it functions as a molecular shield that protects against premature fusogenic rearrangements of the cognate Gc (Halldorsson et al., 2018). Host-cell entry of RVFV is instigated by attachment of Gn-Gc-associated oligomannose-type glycans to the C-type lectin DC-SIGN (Crispin et al., 2014, Lozach et al., 2011, Phoenix et al., 2016). Following caveolae-mediated endocytic uptake, displacement of the Gn is expected to expose the Gc and allow fusion of the virion and cellular membranes in a histidine-triggered pH-dependent process (de Boer et al., 2012, Halldorsson et al., 2016, Harmon et al., 2012, Lozach et al., 2010). Recovery from RVFV infection is associated with the development of high titers of neutralizing antibodies, which convey long-lasting protection against further infection (Bird and Nichol, 2012, Madani et al., 2003, Sabin and Blumberg, 1947). Although antibodies are elicited against structural and non-structural protein components of the phlebovirus during infection (Boshra et al., 2011, Brown et al., 1957, Fernandez et al., 2012, Zaki et al., 2006), neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) are predominantly raised against the Gn and Gc glycoproteins, revealing them to be important targets for vaccine and antiviral design (Faburay et al., 2017). We sought to investigate the molecular basis of RVFV neutralization by the humoral immune response. Using recombinant RVFV Gn as an immunogen, we isolated a class of Gn-specific rabbit monoclonal nAbs, which protect against RVFV challenge in a murine infection model. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that these nAbs target the membrane-distal head region of RVFV Gn. These data provide a molecular rationale for understanding Ab-mediated targeting of RVFV and establish a domain on RVFV Gn as a region of immune vulnerability on the phleboviral surface. RESULTS. RVFV GN GLYCOPROTEIN ELICITS A PROTECTIVE NEUTRALIZING AB RESPONSE. As neutralizing Abs raised during infection and immunization have been shown to target the phleboviral Gn (Faburay et al., 2017), we hypothesized that recombinantly expressed RVFV Gn would constitute an effective immunogen and could be used to elicit nAbs. We immunized four New Zealand white rabbits with RVFV Gn and, following the second boost, observed a potent neutralizing IgG response against the glycoprotein (Figures 1A–1C; Table S1). We sought to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the response generated by immunization.",PMC,pos,1,pos,5077,pos_PMC,0.98644173,1
30626682,"Broadly Cross-Reactive, Nonneutralizing Antibodies against Influenza B Virus Hemagglutinin Demonstrate Effector Function-Dependent Protection against Lethal Viral Challenge in Mice. Protection from influenza virus infection is canonically associated with antibodies that neutralize the virus by blocking the interaction between the viral hemagglutinin and host cell receptors. However, protection can also be conferred by other mechanisms, including antibody-mediated effector functions. Here, we report the characterization of 22 broadly cross-reactive, nonneutralizing antibodies specific for influenza B virus hemagglutinin. The majority of these antibodies recognized influenza B viruses isolated over the period of 73 years and bind the conserved stalk domain of the hemagglutinin. A proportion of the characterized antibodies protected mice from both morbidity and mortality after challenge with a lethal dose of influenza B virus. Activity in an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity reporter assay correlated strongly with protection, suggesting that Fc-dependent effector function determines protective efficacy. The information regarding mechanism of action and epitope location stemming from our characterization of these antibodies will inform the design of urgently needed vaccines that could induce broad protection against influenza B viruses.IMPORTANCE While broadly protective antibodies against the influenza A virus hemagglutinin have been well studied, very limited information is available for antibodies that broadly recognize influenza B viruses. Similarly, the development of a universal or broadly protective influenza B virus vaccine lags behind the development of such a vaccine for influenza A virus. More information about epitope location and mechanism of action of broadly protective influenza B virus antibodies is required to inform vaccine development. In addition, protective antibodies could be a useful tool to treat or prevent influenza B virus infection in pediatric cohorts or in a therapeutic setting in immunocompromised individuals in conjugation with existing treatment avenues.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,5086,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.37294757,0
30649035,"Chronic Distal Sensory Polyneuropathy Is a Major Contributor to Balance Disturbances in Persons Living With HIV. INTRODUCTION. Falls are common among persons living with HIV (PLWH), particularly in those who are older, affecting 30% of those over age 50 in a recent study [1]. They may have a profound impact on quality of life, disability and health outcomes [2]. For example, balance problems interfere with the ability to benefit from physical exercise, which is strongly recommended to reduce cardiovascular risk, and for other health benefits.[3, 4] Additionally, falls increase the risk of fractures in PLWH who often have comorbid accelerated bone mineral density loss [5]. Self-reported balance disturbances represent an important, readily identifiable risk factor for future falls [6]. In PLWH, highly prevalent comorbidities and treatment factors are believed to contribute to balance disturbances and falls. These include peripheral neuropathy and polypharmacy [2, 3, 7]. Objective loss of sensory function in the toes and feet on neurological examination are key features of chronic distal sensory polyneuropathy (cDSPN). Loss of afferent sensory signaling from the feet and legs due to neuropathy is a well-known cause of ataxia, balance disturbances and falls. cDSPN is the most common type of peripheral neuropathy in PLWH, affecting half of those over age 50 [8]. Virologic suppression on antiretroviral therapy does not eliminate cDSPN [8, 9], thus its prevalence remains high, particularly in older, long-term PLWH survivors. As yet, no previous study has evaluated how cDSPN, defined by careful, objective neurological examination, impacts balance disturbances in PLWH. Prior reports have examined neuropathy defined only by the presence of neuropathic symptoms [1]. This is a critical distinction, since more than half of cDSPN in HIV is asymptomatic. We aimed to evaluate the contribution of cDSPN to balance disturbances, relative to the impact of other comorbidities likely to affect balance, such as age, polypharmacy and effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. We hypothesized that balance disturbances would be much more common in PLWH compared to persons without HIV and that cDSPN would be a strong, independent contributor to balance problems. METHODS. PARTICIPANTS AND DESIGN. Participants were ambulatory HIV+ and HIV− adults enrolled in NIH-funded research protocols. They were enrolled at six sites (University of California, San Diego, University of Texas, Galveston, Johns Hopkins University, Washington University, the University of Washington and Mount Sinai) between September 11, 2003, and June 28, 2017. Each participant contributed data from a single baseline evaluation. The University’s Institutional Review Board approved this study, and all participants provided written, informed consent. Detailed information on the source populations and methods for these studies has been previously published [8, 10]. Briefly, data were collected according to a standardized protocol of comprehensive neuromedical and laboratory assessments. Eligibility criteria included the ability to undergo neurologic examination to document objective abnormalities diagnostic of cDSPN and a structured clinical interview to provide details of neuropathy symptoms. General exclusion criteria for the study included blindness, wheelchair dependence, and falls known to be consequence of sustaining a violent blow, loss of consciousness, or sudden onset of paralysis as in stroke or epilepsy. CLINICAL EVALUATIONS. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND SELF-REPORTED SYMPTOMS OF CDSPN. cDSPN was diagnosed based on a standardized, objective neurological examination conducted by a trained clinician. cDSPN was defined by the presence of at least one specific sign: a consistent pattern of symmetrical, distal, bilateral reduction in deep tendon reflexes or reduced sensation to pin or vibration. cDSPN symptoms were self-reported pain (dysesthesia), tingling (paresthesia), and numbness (loss of sensation). Additionally, gait was observed by the clinician; participants were asked to walk as briskly as could be done safely for 10–20 feet, turn, and return to the starting point, walking normally, on heels, toes, and in a tandem fashion. The predominant feature of the subject’s gait pattern was recorded, ranging from normal gait, neuropathic or “foot slapping” (predominant abnormality is weakness of foot dorsiflexors), “waddling” (weakness of hip girdle muscles), ataxia (disproportionate difficulty with tandem), paraparesis (weakness with bilateral spasticity, scissoring), hemiparetic (unilateral weakness and spasticity), orthopedic (e.g., knee, hip, or ankle pain, or limitation in range of motion) or mixed. SELF-REPORTED BALANCE DISTURBANCE. A structured clinical interview was administered to participants bytrained interviewers to collect any history of balance disturbance and its onset (the past few days up to the previous ten years). Inter-examiner reliability was ensured through systematic training. Balance disturbances were classified as not present; occasionally unsteady, no falls; frequently unsteady; some near-falls or rare falls; and must use a cane, walker or other prop. We recoded balance disturbance classes into minimal or none (occasionally unsteady, no falls) and mild-to-moderate (frequently unsteady, some near-falls, some falls, or must use a cane, walker or other prop). HIV CHARACTERISTICS AND COVARIATES. The following HIV disease and treatment data were obtained: estimated duration of HIV infection, nadir CD4+ lymphocyte counts, AIDS status and current use of cART. Laboratory assays included CD4 and viral load. Data on use of antihypertensive and other medications, including sedatives and opioids, and body mass index were obtained to examine as potential covariates,. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.

We also designed a linear dimer (diUbV), which targeted the DUSP and catalytic domains, and exhibited enhanced specificity and more potent inhibition of catalytic activity than either UbV alone. In cells, the UbVs inhibited the deubiquitination of two USP15 substrates, SMURF2 and TRIM25, and the diUbV inhibited the effects of USP15 on the transforming growth factor β pathway. Structural analyses revealed that three distinct UbVs bound to the catalytic domain and locked the active site in a closed, inactive conformation, and one UbV formed an unusual strand-swapped dimer and bound two DUSP domains simultaneously.

30769341,"Facile single-molecule pull-down assay for analysis of endogenous proteins. 1. INTRODUCTION. Fluorescence-based single-molecule techniques have become an invaluable tool for biological research over the past two decades, providing critical insight into the function of various biomolecules and their interactions. They have been used not only to study molecular mechanisms including the conformational changes of biomolecules, fast kinetics and short-lived interactions, gene expression levels and protein-tracking [1-3], but also to provide quantitative and fast bioanalytical tools [4, 5]. The single-molecule pull-down assay [6, 7] (SiMPull) is a powerful technique that allows proteins to be selectively immobilized on a microscope coverslip via immunoprecipitation and labeled with fluorophores for imaging in a fluorescence microscope. SiMPull has been used to study protein expression level and the stoichiometry of protein complexes, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase [8] and the cardiac sodium channel α-subunit Nav1.5 [9]. When used in conjunction with single-molecule co-immunoprecipitation, SiMPull can be used to study weakly interacting molecules such as signalling complexes related to cancers [10, 11], protein-nucleic acid interactions [7, 12], and protein-lipid interactions [13]. These transiently interacting complexes are often difficult to detect using ensemble measurements, such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or through SDS-PAGE and Western blots where harsh denaturing chemicals are used. SiMPull has also been applied to measure the protein content of individual cells via single-cell pull-down (SiCPull). By lysing cells in a flow chamber it is possible to use SiMPull to measure the dissociation rates of protein complexes [14], or cell-to-cell differences in protein expression level [15]. Unlike single-cell Western blots [16], SiCPull maintains the native states of the target proteins. Previously, we used SiMPull to analyze alpha-synuclein (α-SYN) [17], a protein that is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Aggregates of α-SYN in Lewy bodies, predominately found on dopaminergic neurons, are a key identifier when diagnosing PD [18]. There has been a debate over whether the monomeric or tetrameric form of α-SYN is the stable form, and which causes the aggregation found in PD patients [19, 20]. Using SiMPull, we were able to compare the overall α-SYN populations between brain tissue lysates taken from a healthy control and PD patient. Additionally, by analyzing the intensity of each single-molecule spot we were able to compare the oligomeric fraction of α-SYN between them. The ability to use SiMPull for the quantitative analysis of unpurified endogenous lysates makes it a powerful tool for potential applications in early diagnostics and the study of disease progression. However, our previous SiMPull study of α-SYN necessiated a lengthy procedure, primarily due to the glass passivation time and multiple sample incubation steps, making SiMPull less appealing for use outside of a research lab setting. Like most single-molecule experiements, SiMPull requires a well-passivated surface to minimize the nonspecific binding of biomolecules to a surface. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the gold-standard for single-molecule passivation [21, 22], but the preparation of PEG-passivated slides is tedious and time consuming, typically requiring overnight passivation. Alternatively, Tween-20 has been shown to be effective at blocking the nonspecific adsorption of proteins to a substrate [23], and Hua et al. [24] demonstrated the applicability of dichlorodimethylsilane (DDS) and Tween-20 passivation (DT20) for single-molecule studies under various conditions including different pH values and ionic strengths. This approach demonstrated not only reduced nonspecific binding compared to PEG passivation, but the simplified procedure of DT20 passivation takes a fraction of the time of PEG passivation. DT20 passivation has been applied to a variety of single-molecule studies including DNA walker tracking [25], single-molecule FRET analysis of ribosome conformational changes [26], and analyzing the stability of collagen under applied force [27]. Another drawback of SiMPull is that the sample preparation can be lengthy due to the need to sequentially incubate reagents, which often requires at least 20 minutes per incubation. In typical experiments for detecting endogenous proteins using a PEG surface, SiMPull requires at least six steps, i.e., the incubation of Neutravidin, biotinylated secondary capture antibodies, primary capture antibodies, the protein of interest, primary detection antibodies, and fluorescently labeled secondary detection antibodies. Combined with the time to asssemble the flow chamber, this process of preparing SiMPull samples typically takes upwards of two and a half hours. Here, we present a simple method to perform SiMPull for the analysis of endogenous proteins using DT20 passivation and F(ab) fragments for fluorescent labeling. Our approach is based on the idea that ELISA typically uses plastic well-plates [28], which are hydrophobic, similar to a DDS surface. This means that proteins or antibodies can be adsorbed directly onto the hydrophobic surface. Thus, the steps of sequentially incubating Neutravidin and biotinylated secondary capture antibodies can be omitted when DT20 passivation is utilized. Schematics comparing the anchoring of antibodies to a DDS surface and a tradional PEG surface are shown in figure 1. We demonstrate that antibodies or proteins can be tethered directly to the DDS surface before Tween-20 passivation, reducing the number of reagents required while maintaining single-molecule specificity. Additionally, we employed fluorescently labeled F(ab) fragments as detection secondary antibodies. Unlike F(ab′)2 fragements or whole IgG antibodies, the F(ab) fragments are monovalent, which prevents them from forming large complexes when incubated in solution with primary antibodies.

30769365,"Imaging, Surgical, and Pathology Findings of a Myxoid Aortic Sarcoma: When Distal Embolization Uncovers a Bigger Problem. CASE PRESENTATION. A 71-year-old male, transferred from a rural hospital after an emergent small bowel resection, was diagnosed with a floating aortic mass involving the descending thoracic aorta (DTA) ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). Idiopathic thoracic aortic thrombosis was considered as the most likely primary diagnosis. The patient underwent replacement of the DTA with full cardiopulmonary bypass under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Access was established through a left thoracoabdominal incision with inflow cannulation of the left carotid and left femoral artery and outflow cannulation of the left femoral vein. At time of surgery, the aorta was found to be filled by a gelatinous material ( Fig. 3 ). The specimen analysis showed a poorly differentiated mucinous tumor, characterized as a high-grade myxoid intimal aortic sarcoma ( Figs. 4 and 5 ). The patient had a slow postoperative recovery without cerebrovascular accidents. Nonetheless, within 3 weeks of surgery, he was diagnosed with diffuse metastatic liver disease. This diagnosis and the overall rapid decline in his health conditions precluded any further adjuvant treatment and he was transferred to hospice care. DISCUSSION. Primary aortic sarcomas are a very rare condition which carries a dismal prognosis. 1 They include leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, angiosarcoma, hemangioendothelioma, and myxoid sarcoma. 1 They are more commonly localized in the abdominal aorta and they arise from the aortic media or the intima, with the latter being the most common. 2 Among aortic sarcomas, myxoid type is almost a unique finding. 3 Intimal sarcomas typically present with symptoms of distal embolization, whereas sarcomas arising from the media have an even subtler presentation. 2. The challenge of establishing a correct diagnosis in cases presenting with distal embolization relies on the implementation of an algorithm aimed at identifying the source of embolization and defining the nature of the primary pathology. Once the heart is ruled out as the primary possible embolization site with transesophageal echocardiogram, evaluation of the aorta by computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging is required, 4 5 since a primary pathology of the aorta such as an intraluminal wall thrombus and an infectious or neoplastic process can represent the embolic source. Differential diagnosis includes, in absence of aneurysmal disease or severe atherosclerosis of the aorta, idiopathic thoracic aortic thrombosis, aortitis, and a neoplastic or infectious process. 4. Diagnosis is obtained by microscopic examination of the secondary embolization site and by pathology examination of the primary aortic specimen. Indication for aortic replacement is represented by any floating aortic mass associated with distal embolization. 4 5 Also, the need to obtain a tissue diagnosis may indicate surgery. In the case presented, the choice for left carotid artery cannulation as inflow for cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was dictated by the need to avoid retrograde aortic flow and aortic cross-clamping to minimize the risk of cerebrovascular embolization. In cases of aortic sarcoma, aortic replacement with adjuvant therapy offers the best palliation. Longer survival is achieved for differentiated tumors but surgery may be futile in cases with high tumor grade and diffuse metastatic spread. 3.",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,5118,far_neg_PMC,0.0037000459,0
30773397,"Conformational Changes in the Cytoplasmic Region of KIR3DL1 upon Interaction with SHP-2. SUMMARY. KIR3DL1 is an inhibitory killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) that negatively regulates natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. The KIR3DL1 cytoplasmic region (3DL1-cyto) is disordered and can be dissected into three segments: (I) H340-V351; (II) M352-D371; and (III) P372-P423. NMR studies indicate that segment II can dynamically adopt a loop-like conformation, and segments I and III can form dynamic helices that may mediate binding to membranes, particularly in the region around the N-terminal (N) immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), consistent with its role in signaling. Furthermore, individual SH2 domains of SHP-2 strongly engage with the unphosphorylated N-ITIM of 3DL1-cyto, while binding of the tandem SHP-2 SH2 domains to the bis-phosphorylated ITIMs results in more extensive conformational changes in segments I and III. The findings enhance our understanding of KIR function and how ITIMs in a target receptor operate in concert to engage the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-2. INTRODUCTION. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune effectors that can eradicate transformed, stressed, or virus-infected cells. In humans, NK cells constitute 5–15% of peripheral blood lymphocytes and are widely distributed in blood and peripheral tissues (Caligiuri, 2008; Campbell and Hasegawa, 2013). They are particularly important in cancer prevention and therapy, recognizing, adhering to and mediating direct spontaneous cytotoxicity of certain tumor cells, as well as releasing the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and TNF-α (Campbell and Hasegawa, 2013; Mentlik James et al., 2013). NK cell activation is controlled by a balance of opposing signals from activating receptors, such as natural cytotoxicity receptors, NKG2D, CD16, DNAM-1, and 2B4, and inhibitory receptors, such as CD94/NKG2A and the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR; also known as CD158). KIR are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins expressed on NK cells and a subset of T cells encoded by 14 polymorphic genes (KIR2DL1–5, KIR3DL1–3, KIR2DS1–5, and KIR3DS1) (Campbell and Purdy, 2011). They play important roles in human NK cell development, tolerance, and activation by recognizing major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules expressed on normal cells as ligands. Activating receptors initiate target cell lysis and cytokine production when an NK cell encounters an abnormal target cell lacking MHC-I, whereas inhibitory KIR suppress responses toward normal cells through recognition of MHC-I expressed on their surfaces (Biron, 1997; Storkus et al., 1987). When inhibitory KIR engage with MHC-I on normal cells, tyrosine residues in two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs; I/V/LxYxxL/V) are phosphorylated by Src-family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs; such as Lck and Fyn), which creates specific docking sites for the cytosolic Src Homology Region 2 (SH2)-containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (PTPs), SHP-1 and SHP-2 (PTPN6 and PTPN11, respectively). Recruitment of SHP-1/2 leads to the dominant suppression of activating receptor signals transduced via PTKs, thereby tolerizing NK cells toward normal MHC-I-expressing cells in the body (MacFarlane and Campbell, 2006; Matalon et al., 2016). Each KIR family member has specificity for a distinct subset of the MHCI molecules. KIR3DL1 (3DL1) is a common inhibitory receptor that recognizes HLA-Bw4-containing MHC-I (Litwin et al., 1994). The 3DL1 cytoplasmic region (3DL1-cyto: aa 340–423) contains a pair of ITIM motifs, N-ITIM and C-ITIM (Fig. 1A), which are similar in most inhibitory KIR (Campbell and Purdy, 2011). SHP-1 and SHP-2 are members of a small subfamily of PTPs that play vital regulatory roles in cell biology by modulating protein-tyrosine phosphorylation patterns in concert with PTKs. They have high structural and sequence homology (~60% amino acid sequence identity), and both contain tandem SH2 domains (N-SH2 and C-SH2) and a C-terminal catalytic PTP domain. Numerous studies have established a role for SHP-1 in KIR inhibitory function (Binstadt et al., 1996; Burshtyn et al., 1996; Campbell et al., 1996; Fry et al., 1996; Olcese et al., 1996), but involvement of SHP-2 is less clear. Several reports described SHP-2 association with tyrosine phosphorylated KIR (Bruhns et al., 1999; Kikuchi-Maki et al., 2003; Yusa and Campbell, 2003; Yusa et al., 2004). Also, expression of dominant negative (DN)-SHP-1 (C459S) or DN-SHP-2 (C453S) in NK cell lines can block KIR-mediated inhibition of cytotoxicity (Yusa and Campbell, 2003), indicating that both play important functional roles. However, these results do not rule out competition with other negative effector proteins that might be physiologically recruited to mediate inhibition. SHP-2 often contributes to activation signals in other receptor systems (Matozaki et al., 2009; Poole and Jones, 2005), which further complicates data interpretation. We previously performed biochemical and structure/function analysis of 3DL1(Yusa and Campbell, 2003) to show: (1) whereas SHP-1 only binds when both KIR ITIMs are phosphorylated, SHP-2 can constitutively associate with the unphosphorylated NITIM; (2) the N-ITIM was essential and sufficient to impart strong inhibitory function to 3DL1 via SHP-2; and (3) the degree of inhibition directly correlated with SHP-2 binding to wild-type (WT) and tyrosine mutant forms of 3DL1. Furthermore, replacing the cytoplasmic domain of 3DL1 with the PTP domain of SHP-2 resulted in a receptor that inhibits target cell cytotoxicity by NK cells. Although these cell biology results provide strong evidence for involvement of SHP-2 in NK cell inhibitory function, the structural basis of SHP-2 binding to KIR ITIMs in the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states is unknown. Despite our observations that both sequence-based predictions and NMR spectra showed 3DL1-cyto is highly flexible and represents an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), we have assigned backbone and side-ch",PMC,pos,1,pos,5120,pos_PMC,0.9972638,1
30787279,"The companion of cellulose synthase 1 confers salt tolerance through a Tau-like mechanism in plants. INTRODUCTION. Microtubules are tubular structures essential to morphogenesis, division and motility in eukaryotic cells. While animal cells typically contain a centrosome with radiating microtubules toward the cell periphery, growing plant cells arrange their microtubules along the cell cortex. A major function of the cortical microtubules in plant cells is to direct the synthesis of cellulose, a fundamental component of the cell wall essential to plant morphology. Cellulose is produced at the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase (CESA) protein complexes (CSCs) that display catalytically driven motility along the membrane. The recently described microtubule-associated protein (MAP), COMPANION OF CELLULOSE SYNTHASE 1 (CC1), is an integral component of the CSC and sustains cellulose synthesis by promoting the formation of a stress-tolerant microtubule array during salt stress. As cellulose synthesis is key for plant growth, engineering of plants to better produce cellulose is of utmost importance to agriculture. Indeed, understanding the molecular mechanism by which CC1 controls cellulose synthesis may bear opportunities to improve cultivation on salt-affected lands. The microtubule network is highly dynamic, and its state is influenced by the action of MAPs. The mammalian Tau/MAP2/MAP4 family represents the most investigated MAP set, primarily due to Tau’s importance in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. In vitro, Tau promotes polymerization and bundling of microtubules, and diffuses along the microtubule lattice. In the brain, Tau is predominantly located at the axons of neurons, where it contributes to the microtubule organization that drives neurite outgrowth. In disease, Tau self-aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles that might trigger neurodegeneration. Intriguingly, no clear homologs of the Tau/MAP2/MAP4 family have been identified in plants. Because, the full scope of Tau’s biological role remains elusive, identification of Tau-related proteins outside the animal Kingdom would benefit our understanding of how this class of MAPs functions. In this study, we unravel the microtubule-binding mechanism of CC1 and show that it is reminiscent to that of Tau, indicating evolutionary convergence of MAP functions across animal and plant cells. RESULTS. THE N-TERMINUS OF CC1 BUNDLES MICROTUBULES. The cytosolic N-terminal part of CC1 (residues 1–120, CC1ΔC223) binds to microtubules and restores microtubule reassembly, cellulose synthesis and wild-type growth of cc1cc2 (null-mutation in CC1 and its closest homolog CC2) seedlings on high levels of salt. These data indicate that CC1ΔC223 is critical to CC1’s function during stress, and we therefore set out to investigate the molecular details of how it interacts with microtubules. We cross-linked 6xHis-tagged CC1ΔC223 with α-β-tubulin dimers using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), which led to di- and multimeric protein products (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a). We used EDC, which links functional groups of lysine to either aspartate or glutamate, and not the typical sulfhydryl-reactive or lysine–lysine cross-linkers, as CC1ΔC223 only contains a single cysteine and has a basic isoelectric point (pI) (i.e. the main reactive amino acid is lysine), while tubulin/microtubules have an acidic pI (i.e. the main reactive amino acids on the surface of the tubulin dimer are aspartate and glutamate). After LC/MS/MS analysis, we used four different software packages (StavroX, pLink, SIM-XL, Crux) to identify potential inter-cross-links between tubulin and CC1ΔC223. Extensive manual curation resulted in five well-defined covalent bonds between CC1∆C223 and α- or β-tubulin (Fig. 1b). We consistently detected four peptides of CC1∆C223 cross-linked to β-tubulin (K40–E111, K94–E111, K96–E111 and K96–E158; letters and numbers indicate amino acids in CC1∆C223 and β-tubulin, respectively; Fig. 1b, c; Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1b-h). Notably, the three sequentially distant K40 and K94/96 of CC1∆C223 cross-linked to the same residue on β-tubulin (E111). This suggests that two CC1 regions might bind the same sites on two different β-tubulin molecules, which is corroborated by the multimeric protein products in the SDS page. The cross-linked position on α-tubulin is close to the hydrophobic interface between tubulin heterodimers, a site that is frequently occupied by agents that directly regulate microtubule formation, such as vinblastine, the stathmin-like domain (SLD) of RB3, and also by Tau (Supplementary Fig. 2a-b). To further investigate how CC1∆C223 binds microtubules, we co-polymerized tubulin in the presence of CC1ΔC223. We then labeled CC1ΔC223 using 5 nm gold-conjugates that recognize the His-tag and monitored the formed microtubules and gold distribution via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Gold labeling only occurred at closely aligned microtubules with very small inter-microtubule distances (Fig. 1d, e, Supplementary Fig. 1d-e), and were visible as evenly distributed foci in straight rows along interphases of two neighboring microtubules (Fig. 1d, e), while a negative control employing BSA did not show any specific microtubule labeling (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The gold particles were typically spaced by 10 nm (Fig. 1f; 10.0 nm ± 2.4 nm; mean ± S.D.; three-independent experiments; n = 1785 labels). The number of gold-labels in a given row ranged between two and 41 labels (Fig. 1g; 8 ± 5 labels; mean ± S.D; three independent replicates; n = 274 rows), making each row about 80 nm in length. We also observed multiple gold-labeled rows on one microtubule when in close proximity to several other microtubules (Supplementary Fig. 2d). The angles between gold-labeled rows were small (Fig. 1h; 2.8° ± 3°; mean ± S.D.; three-independent replicates; n = 98 rows), highlighting that the labeling did not shift between neighboring protofilaments on the same microtubule.

30827843,"Structural Insights into Stimulation of Ash1L's H3K36 Methyltransferase Activity through Mrg15 Binding. The evolutionarily conserved Trithorax group protein Ash1 is a SET domain histone methyltransferase that mono- and dimethylates lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36). Ash1 forms a complex with Mrg15 and Nurf55, and the binding of Mrg15 greatly stimulates the catalytic activity of Ash1, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the tandem Mrg15-interacting and SET domains of human Ash1L in complex with Mrg15. Ash1L interacts with Mrg15 principally via a segment located N-terminal to the catalytic SET domain. Surprisingly, an autoinhibitory loop in the post-SET region of Ash1L is destabilized on Mrg15 binding despite no direct contact. Dynamics of the autoinhibitory loop can be attributed to subtle structural changes of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding pocket induced by Mrg15 binding, implicating a mechanism of conformational coupling between SAM and substrate binding sites.

BACKGROUND This study elucidates the clinical impact of surgical treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) based on a detailed search of all exons of the TP53 gene and p53 protein phenotypic analysis using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. METHODS Clinically well-annotated FFPE specimens from 317 patients with HNSCC treated by surgery were examined by all-exon TP53 sequencing using a next-generation sequencer and p53 protein phenotype by immunohistochemistry. After excluding human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal carcinomas, two risk categories were classified as ""p53 adverse function"" and ""p53 favorable function"" based on TP53 mutation status and p53 protein phenotype. Mutation in PIK3CA, AKT, and HRAS was also evaluated by target sequence. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for statistical analysis of clinical outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimal surgical margin cutoff for local recurrence. Local control rates were compared between the risk groups using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS Multivariate analysis identified ""p53 adverse function"" as an independent poor predictor of overall survival, local control, and distant metastasis-free survival. In oral cavity cancer, the optimal surgical margin cutoff associated with local recurrence was 6 mm. In patients with surgical margin > 6 mm, the ""p53 adverse function"" group demonstrated significantly higher local recurrence rate than the ""p53 favorable function"" group. PIK3CA, AKT, or HRAS mutation did not correlate with improved overall survival.

30914451,"Kinetic and structural analysis of human ALDH9A1. INTRODUCTION. Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) catalyze the NAD(P)+-dependent irreversible oxidation of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. To date, 24 ALDH gene families have been identified in genomes of eukaryotic species and 19 ALDH genes in Homo sapiens [1,2]. Human ALDH9A1 is a cytosolic tetrameric enzyme of ∼216 kDa that was first purified from the liver and characterized as a 4-aminobutyraldehyde (ABAL) dehydrogenase (ABALDH, E.C. 1.2.1.19) [3]. In mammalian organisms, ABAL is formed via an oxidative deamination of the biogenic amine putrescine by diamine oxidase (E.C. 1.4.3.22) [4]. Its oxidation by ALDH9A1 results in the formation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is a well-known neurotransmitter. ALDH9A1 gene is highly expressed in the liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, and heart [5]. The enzyme is also present in the brain and the spinal cord [6]. The enzyme displays activity with a dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) [7] and much higher with betaine aldehyde (BAL) [6,8] leading to the production of glycine betaine (therefore often annotated as BADH, E.C. 1.2.1.8). Glycine betaine is a quaternary ammonium compound acting as a zwitter-ion at physiological pH and maintaining protein and membrane conformations under various stress conditions [9]. A mammalian ALDH displaying γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde (TMABAL) dehydrogenase (TMABALDH, E.C. 1.2.1.47) activity was first purified from bovine liver [10]. Later on, other mammalian isoforms from rat and human were shown to be TMABALDHs thus it became clear that TMABALDH and ALDH9A1 were indeed the same enzyme [11]. The enzyme is involved in the carnitine synthesis pathway comprising three other enzymes: trimethyl lysine dioxygenase, 3-hydroxy-N-trimethyllysine aldolase and γ-butyrobetaine (TMABA) dioxygenase (Figure 1). Carnitine (3-hydroxy-4-N-trimethylaminobutyrate) is a water-soluble quaternary amine, which transports the CoA-activated fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation as well as products of peroxisomal β-oxidation, for their full oxidation to CO2 and H2O in the Krebs cycle [12]. Both, carnitine synthesis and uptake are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), which is a transcription factor involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. It is abundantly expressed in tissues showing high rates of β-oxidation such as liver and kidney [13]. It has been shown that PPARα regulates the expression of ALDH9A1 gene [14]. ALDH9A1 may play a role in systemic vasculitis and vasculitis-associated diseases such as Kawasaki disease known as a mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome [15]. Patients’ serum with the Kawasaki disease contains significantly induced levels of anti-ALDH9A1 antibodies. Decreased expression of ALDH9A1 may also contribute to a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis without inflammation as reported by the study on a mice model [16]. Allelic variants in ALDH9A1 gene have also been observed [5]. Polymorphism in several genes related to GABA signaling pathway including ALDH9A1 has been associated with neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia, which is an involuntary movement disorder that develops in patients undergoing a long-term treatment with antipsychotic medications [17]. Herein, we report a complete enzymatic characterization and the structure of human ALDH9A1 in three different crystal forms. Kinetic parameters and substrate specificity were determined using various aminoaldehydes including 3-aminopropanal (APAL) or 4-guanidinobutyraldehyde (GBAL), which have so far never been analyzed with this enzyme. ALDH9A1 is one of the few remaining members of the human ALDH superfamily with yet unknown crystal structure. Although the enzyme was co-crystallized with the β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) coenzyme, all structures, which are very similar, are devoid of NAD+ and display the same disordered region forming the coenzyme binding site. Structural comparison with the cod liver ALDH9A2 (PDB ID: 1BPW) and other ALDHs revealed that the inter-domain linker of human ALDH9A1, involved in the coenzyme binding, adopts a position and a fold that have never been observed so far in any X-ray structure of ALDHs. RESULTS. SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITY AND KINETIC PARAMETERS. The human ALDH9A1 (GenBank ID: AF172093) is a protein of 494 amino acids (Uniprot ID: P49189). A new polymorphism site was discovered in cDNA used in this work at the position 330. It appears in the codon for Ile110 (ATT is changed to ATC). However, this variation does not alter the amino acid composition. Kinetic measurements were performed at the known optimal pH of 7.5, as described in previous studies [3,8,11]. The enzyme is very sensitive and becomes nearly inactive after two re-freezing cycles. The effect of the buffer composition on protein stability was further investigated using nano-differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) (Figure 2A) and the highest melting temperatures were observed in buffers at pH 7.0 and 7.5. Several aminoaldehydes were screened as potential substrates of ALDH9A1 using a fixed 1 mM concentration of the NAD+ coenzyme. The enzyme displays a wide range of substrate specificity (Figure 2B). Indeed, although ALDH9A1 shows the highest rate activity for TMABAL and BAL, it can oxidize other aminoaldehydes such APAL, ABAL, γ-dimethylaminobutyraldehyde (DMABAL) or GBAL. In line with previous studies where specific activities of 14, 1.8, and 2.3 nmol.s−1.mg−1 using ABAL were reported for the enzyme isolated from liver and brain [3,6,8], we measured a final activity of ∼1.8 nmol.s−1.mg−1. The enzyme can also convert aliphatic aldehydes such as acetaldehyde, hexanal, or 2-hexanal (lipid peroxidation product) as well as aromatic aldehydes such as benzaldehyde and DOPAL. The Km value for NAD+ of 32 ± 2 μM correlates well with the measured Kd value of 16 ± 3 μM and the previous reported Km value of 13 µM [3].

Nationality governs almost every aspect of our lives, including where we may live and travel, as well as our opportunities for education, healthcare and work. It is a common-sense social category that guides us in making inferences about the social world1-4. Nationalism has been extensively studied within the social5-16 and cognitive sciences17-25, but there has been little empirical investigation into folk theories regarding what determines someone's nationality. In experiments carried out in the United States and India (N = 2,745), we used a variant of the switched-at-birth task26-31 to investigate the extent to which people believe that nationality is determined by biology or is a malleable social identity that can be acquired32-34. We find that folk theories of nationality seem remarkably flexible. Depending on the framing of the question, people report believing that nationality is either fluid or fixed at birth. Our results demonstrate that people from different cultures with different experiences of migration and different explicit stereotypes of their own nation may share similar folk theories about nationality. Moreover, these theories may shape attitudes towards immigrants-an important public-policy issue35-37.

OBJECTIVES To describe the process of translating and adapting the Relationship Scales Questionnaire (RSQ) from English into Brazilian Portuguese and to present the results of its test-retest reliability using the version developed for interview application. METHODOLOGY The process was based on the guidelines of the International Society for Pharmaeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR), which propose 10 steps for the translation and cross-cultural adaptation of self-administered instruments. The original authors of the RSQ have agreed to the translation. The interview version was applied to a sample of 43 healthy elders (≥60 years old) enrolled in a primary health care program in the city of Porto Alegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil, and then reapplied. The scores of the two applications were compared using the paired sample t-test. RESULTS Only 6 of the 30 items required the adaptation of words or expressions to maintain its conceptual and semantic equivalence. The self-administered form of the RSQ posed difficulties for elders due to visual deficiencies and lower education level, both common in this age group, demonstrating a need for the development of a version of the RSQ in a structured interview format. Only the measure for secure attachment presented significant differences after the application of the retest, indicating reliability of the version being proposed.

31004454,"Function and solution structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana RALF8 peptide. INTRODUCTION. The small (~5 kDa), secreted, basic peptides RALF1 and RALF8 are members of the rapid alkalinization factor (RALF) family of plant peptides that affect plant growth, pathogen response, and pollen tube generation.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 The importance of the family of RALF peptides in plants is supported by the presence of a large number of genomic DNA sequences encoding RALF and RALF‐like peptides. A recent study of computationally identified RALF‐like sequences describes 795 RALF coding sequences in 51 different plant species.6 There are around 36 known members of this family of peptides in Arabidopsis, but little information is available on their three‐dimensional (3D) structure despite their important roles in cell signaling and numerous critical plant development processes.7 Genome‐wide gene expression profiling reveals that each RALF member is characterized by tissue‐ and development‐specific expression patterns. For example, RALF1 is most highly expressed in root and acts as a negative regulator of root growth.8 On the other hand, RALF4 is preferentially expressed in pollen and regulates pollen tube growth.2, 9 RALF peptides are shown to act as growth regulatory factors that suppress growth by receptor‐mediated rapid events involving protein phosphorylation, cytoplasmic calcium elevation, and extracellular pH alkalinization.1 A family of CrRLKs (Catharanthus roseus receptor‐like kinases) consisting of 17 members in Arabidopsis is known to comprise receptors for RALF peptides,2, 5, 10 consistent with a model that CrRLKs are the receptors for RALFs. Arabidopsis knockout mutants of CrRLKs, including FERONIA receptor (FER), lack cellular responses to RALF‐induced rapid cytoplasmic calcium elevation. Thus, the measurement of cytoplasmic calcium changes has been used as an assay for examining cellular sensitivity to this peptide ligand. The sequence identity among the RALF peptides varies significantly, but they contain four highly conserved cysteine residues that have been shown to be required for biological activity.11 RALF1, which is the predominant RALF isoform present in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, suppresses root elongation via FER‐mediated protein phosphorylation signaling, and this interaction in vivo most likely involves other interacting proteins or chaperones.8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 A recent in vitro crosslink study indicated that the C‐terminal region of RALF1 can be colocalized with the amino terminal region of FER, within the ~11 Å chemical crosslinking distance.16 RALF8's involvement in root growth was reported in a study examining the transcriptomic responses of plants that were exposed to simultaneous water deficit and nematode stresses. A subsequent phenotyping assay with RALF8‐overexpressing plants further demonstrated its role in root growth.17. In preliminary tests of Escherichia coli expression of several RALF peptides of known biological function, we were successful in producing two peptides, namely RALF1 and RALF8. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the aligned amino acid sequences of the secreted RALF1 and RALF8 peptides. The RALF peptide family contains distinctive sequence features including the presence of four conserved cysteine residues, an abundance of basic amino acids, and a conserved YISY motif in the amino terminal region of the peptide.18, 19 RALF1 (pI = 10.06) contains no acidic residues, no histidine residues, and one proline, whereas RALF8 (pI = 9.08) contains three acidic residues, four histidine residues, and four proline residues; this suggests that the two RALF peptides likely have distinctive side chain structures when exposed to different pH environments. We successfully produced biologically active recombinant RALF8 peptides from E. coli strains, and then used an in vivo assay based on inhibition of plant root growth to demonstrate that the peptide regulates root growth through a FER signaling pathway.20 By contrast, RALF1 samples produced from E. coli under a number of expression, isolation, and purification conditions (including those successful with RALF8) exhibited aggregation, suggesting a non‐native state and yielded poor quality nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. RALF8 yielded well‐resolved NMR spectra, and we were able to determine its structure in solution. Our results show that RALF8 is largely disordered with the exception of two ordered loops, each spanned by a disulfide bridge. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. The genes coding for RALF1 and RALF8 was cloned from A. thaliana, and the peptides corresponding to excreted peptides were produced from E. coli cells. Of the many approaches tried with RALF1, the construct with the highest yield used the Flexi vector pVP67K with an N‐terminal His‐tag.21 However, most of the RALF1 peptides produced was in insoluble inclusion bodies and resisted refolding. By contrast, we were able to prepare the native sequence of RALF8 as a soluble active peptide using the pE‐SUMO (small ubiquitin modifier) (Kan) vector.22 Figure 2 shows sodium dodecly sulfate ‐ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE) analyses at various steps in the isolation and purification of RALF8. The mass spectrum of the 15N‐labeled RALF8 peptide (Fig. 3) shows that the level of isotopic enrichment was about 93%. These results also indicate that the peptide is the full length expected. To examine the in vivo activity of the isolated RALF8 peptide, we have tested both a rapid response, cytoplasmic calcium elevation and a long‐term effect, root growth suppression of Arabidopsis seedlings. RALF8 samples were shown to be active by a cytoplasmic calcium mobilization assay [Fig. 4(a)] and by a root growth inhibition assay [Fig. 4(b,c)]. Because root growth suppression caused by the RALF1 peptide involves the function of a plasma membrane receptor, FERONIA,10 we also examined RALF8‐caused root growth suppression with a feronia (fer) knockout mutant plant. Wild‐type roots showed 75% growth inhibition at 1 μM RALF8 concentration compar",PMC,pos,1,pos,5170,pos_PMC,0.9975466,1
31102680,"Exploring structural aspects of the human Golgi matrix protein GRASP55 in solution. In mammals, the Golgi apparatus is the central hub for intracellular trafficking, sorting and post-translational modifications of proteins and lipids. Golgi reassembly and stacking proteins (GRASPs) are somehow involved in Golgi stacking, which is relevant for its proper function, and also in unconventional protein secretion. However, the structural details on how GRASPs accomplish those tasks are still elusive. Here, we have explored the biochemical and biophysical properties of human full-length GRASP55 in solution. Sequence-based analyses and circular dichroism spectroscopy suggest that GRASP55 presents multiple intrinsically disordered sites, although keeping considerable contents of regular secondary structure. Size exclusion chromatography and multiple-angle light scattering show that GRASP55 are monomers in solution. Urea denaturation of GRASP55 suggests the transition to the unfolded state is a cooperative process. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis displays two endothermic transitions for GRASP55, indicating the existence of an intermediate state prior to unfolding. Thioflavin T fluorescence suggests GRASP55 intermediate can be aggregates/fibrils. Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy prove GRASP55 forms large amorphous aggregates but not amyloid-like fibrils in the intermediate state. These results could be helpful in discussing the proper function of human GRASP55 in the Golgi organization as well as unconventional secretion of proteins.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,5196,pos_MEDLINE,0.9978594,1

Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is a key enzyme in the catabolism of phenylalanine, and mutations in this enzyme cause phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder that leads to brain damage and mental retardation if untreated. Some patients benefit from supplementation with a synthetic formulation of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) that partly acts as a pharmacological chaperone. Here we present structures of full-length human PAH (hPAH) both unbound and complexed with BH4 in the precatalytic state. Crystal structures, solved at 3.18-Å resolution, show the interactions between the cofactor and PAH, explaining the negative regulation exerted by BH4 BH4 forms several H-bonds with the N-terminal autoregulatory tail but is far from the catalytic FeII Upon BH4 binding a polar and salt-bridge interaction network links the three PAH domains, explaining the stability conferred by BH4 Importantly, BH4 binding modulates the interaction between subunits, providing information about PAH allostery. Moreover, we also show that the cryo-EM structure of hPAH in absence of BH4 reveals a highly dynamic conformation for the tetramers. Structural analyses of the hPAH:BH4 subunits revealed that the substrate-induced movement of Tyr138 into the active site could be coupled to the displacement of BH4 from the precatalytic toward the active conformation, a molecular mechanism that was supported by site-directed mutagenesis and targeted molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, comparison of the rat and human PAH structures show that hPAH is more dynamic, which is related to amino acid substitutions that enhance the flexibility of hPAH and may increase the susceptibility to PKU-associated mutations.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,5200,pos_MEDLINE,0.9976814,1

A synthetic antimicrobial peptide library based on the human autophagy 16 polypeptide has been developed. Designed acetylated peptides bearing lipids of different chain lengths resulted in peptides with enhanced potency compared to the parent Atg16. A 21-residue fragment of Atg16 conjugated to 4-methylhexanoic acid (K30) emerged as the most potent antibacterial, with negligible hemolysis. Several studies, including microscopy, dye leakage, and ITC, were conducted to gain insight into the antibacterial mechanism of action of the peptide. Visual inspection using both SEM and TEM revealed the membranolytic effect of the peptide on bacterial cells. The selectivity of the peptide against bacterial cell membranes was also proven using dye leakage assays. ITC analysis revealed the exothermic nature of the binding interaction of the peptide to D8PG micelles. The three-dimensional solution NMR structure of K30 in complex with dioctanoylphosphatidylglycerol (D8PG) micelles revealed that the peptide adopts a helix-loop-helix structure in the presence of anionic membrane lipids mimicking bacterial membranes. Intermolecular NOEs between the peptide and lipid deciphered the location of the peptide in the bound state, which was subsequently supported by the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR experiment.

Mesoporous silica Santa Barbara Amorphous-15 (SBA15) and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) were introduced in poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) scaffold fabricated by selective laser sintering to co-enhance the bioactivity. On the one hand, the active elements silicon and calcium released respectively by the degradation of SBA15 and nHA were favorable for stimulating cell response. On the other hand, the hydrated silica gel layer derived from SBA15 could adsorb calcium ions released from nHA, thereby co-promoting apatite nucleation and growth. The experimental results showed that the formation of bone-like apatite on the scaffold was accelerated under simulated body fluid, indicating a good biomineralization capacity. Moreover, the scaffold demonstrated a good cell response in promoting the attachment of cell and the expression of alkaline phosphatase activity. Besides, SBA15 and nHA not only improved the hydrophilicity of the scaffold (the water contact angle changed from 107.4° to 57.8°), but also retarded the pH reduction by neutralizing the acidic hydrolysate of PLLA.

The serine/arginine-rich protein kinase 2 (SRPK2) has been reported as upregulated in several cancer types, with roles in hallmarks such as cell migration, growth, and apoptosis. These findings have indicated that SRPK2 is a promising emerging target in drug discovery initiatives. Although high-resolution models are available for SRPK2 (PDB 2X7G), they have been obtained with a heavily truncated recombinant protein version (~50% of the primary structure), due to the presence of long intrinsically unstructured regions. In the present work, we sought to characterize the structure of a full-length recombinant version of SRPK2 in solution. Low-resolution Small-Angle X-ray Scattering data were obtained for both versions of SRPK2. The truncated ΔNΔS-SRPK2 presented a propensity to dimerize at higher concentrations whereas the full-length SRPK2 was mainly found as dimers. The hydrodynamic behavior of the full-length SRPK2 was further investigated by analytical size exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. SRPK2 behaved as a monomer-dimer equilibrium and both forms have an elongated shape in solution, pointing to a stretched-to-closed tendency among the conformational plasticity observed. Taken together, these findings allowed us to define unique structural features of the SRPK2 within SRPK family, characterized by its flexible regions outside the bipartite kinase domain.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,5223,pos_MEDLINE,0.99765414,1

We confirm that Rashba spin splitting occurs in band structure of MoS2 on GaN. We also find that the surface states of GaN move to the deep position in band structure in the MoS2/Ga-GaN case, while the surface states of GaN are hybridized with MoS2 near the Fermi level for the MoS2/N-GaN case. Furthermore, we investigate the variation in electronic structure of MoS2/GaN heterostructures depending on the number of MoS2 layers. Especially, the top layer MoS2 of the 2L-MoS2/GaN structures shows both n-type and p-type properties depending on the GaN surface termination.

31260731,"Pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects of glycated albumin on cardiomyocytes. Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant circulating protein in the body and presents an extensive range of biological functions. As such, it is prone to undergo post-translational modifications (PTMs). The non-enzymatic early glycation of HSA, one of the several PTMs undergone by HSA, arises from the addition of reducing sugars to amine group residues, thus modifying the structure of HSA. These changes may affect HSA functions impairing its biological activity, finally leading to cell damage. The aim of this study was to quantitate glycated-HSA (GA) levels in the plasma of heart failure (HF) patients and to evaluate the biological effects of GA on HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Plasma GA content from HF patients and healthy subjects was measured by direct infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Results pointed out a significant increase of GA in HF patients with respect to the control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, after stimulation with GA, proteomic analysis of HL-1 secreted proteins showed the modulation of several proteins involved, among other processes, in the response to stress. Further, stimulated cells showed a rapid increase in ROS generation, higher mRNA levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and higher levels of the oxidative 4-HNE-protein adducts and carbonylated proteins. Our findings show that plasma GA is increased in HF patients.

31384733,"Effectiveness of the quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in Japan during the 2015-2016 season: A test-negative case-control study comparing the results by real time PCR, virus isolation. 1. INTRODUCTION. Influenza viruses circulate each year causing outbreaks of respiratory illnesses that result in significant morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide [1]. Influenza epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million severe cases of illness and about 290 000 to 650 000 deaths every year [1]. The majority of deaths associated with influenza are detected among elderly people aged 65 and over [1]. The epidemics are also associated with increased work or school absenteeism and loss of productivity. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends annual influenza vaccination to groups at risk for influenza complications including pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy, children 6 months to 5 years of age, elderly (aged 65 and over) individuals with underlying chronic medical conditions, and health-care workers [1]. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare recommends a universal vaccination strategy which states that all children younger than 13 years of age should receive two doses of vaccine each season and that all others receive one dose. Annual influenza vaccination is necessary because of the ongoing antigenic drift of influenza viruses and the need to regularly update the vaccine components [2]. Until recently, only trivalent influenza vaccines, which include one strain of influenza B (either B/Yamagata or B/Victoria lineage) in addition to influenza A/H1N1pmd09 and A/H3N2 were used. However, both influenza B lineages have co-circulated during most influenza seasons and often the vaccine strain did not match the predominant circulating strain [3]. The difficulty in predicting which influenza B lineage will dominate in a given season led to the recommendation to include both influenza B lineage strains in the vaccine [4]. During the 2015–2016 season, WHO recommended that quadrivalent vaccines in the Northern Hemisphere should include a B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Victoria)-like virus in addition to the other three recommended components for the trivalent vaccine (an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata)-like virus) [5]. Until the 2015–2016 season, the trivalent inactivated subunit-antigen vaccine (TIV) was used in Japan [6], and then from the 2015–2016 season the quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (IIV4) was introduced [7]. Four domestic vaccine manufacturers (Denka Seiken, Co., LTD., Kaketsuken, Kitasato Daiichi Sankyo Vaccine Co., LTD, and Biken Co., LTD.) produce influenza vaccines every year for the use of the Japanese population following the recommendation by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan. In Japan, only domestically produced vaccines are used and the vaccine components selected by NIID basically follow WHO recommendation but are occasionally different from WHO recommended strains, although antigenically similar. It is necessary to measure vaccine effectiveness (VE) of Japanese vaccines to monitor their performance and to compare with those of other countries. The 2015–16 season in Japan has been characterized by dominant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity while, influenza B circulated in a 1:1 ratio between B/Yamagata and B/Victoria, according to the report from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases [7]. Thus, it is a good opportunity to examine VE against two lineages of influenza B that were included in the IIV4 for the first time in Japan. In the current study, we analyzed VE of IIV4 during the season when it was first introduced in Japan, using the test-negative case-control design. Effectiveness of influenza vaccine by a test-negative case-control design is becoming the most popular observational study method used to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness and the publication using this method has been reported every year from Australia, Canada, European countries, New Zealand, and the U.S. [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a powerful and very sensitive technique for the identification of influenza virus genome used as a gold standard to define “case” in test-negative case-control design to estimate VEs [10], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. However, in Japan, it is common to use rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) in clinical practice in almost all hospitals and clinics to detect influenza patients, since RDTs are covered by the national health insurance and used as first point of diagnosis and health care, whereas RT-PCR and virus isolation will take several hours and days to get the results [19], [20], [21]. Actually, many influenza VE study in Japan used RDTs as a substitute for real-time PCR [6], [20], [22], [23], [24]. Here, we evaluated VE in patients with laboratory-confirmed samples by RT-PCR and virus isolation, supplemented by RDT. 2. METHODS. 2.1. STUDY DESIGN. Patients with influenza-like illness (body temperature ≥ 37.5 °C, cough, rhinorrhea, malaise), who visited outpatient clinics in Hokkaido, Niigata, Gunma and Nagasaki prefectures between December 2015 and April 2016 were enrolled in this study.

Strengths and limitations of this study. - First study to examine sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake and taxation in a global context, providing a better understanding of tax-policy effectiveness across the complete spectrum of countries. - Results quantify the potential variability in influence of price on SSB intake across countries including by age and sex, suggesting that outcomes of SSB taxes may be significantly influenced by age and the income status of countries. - Being a modelling study, the projected outcomes can only inform how taxes could affect behaviour. - Cross-country analysis of this scope rely on specific data collection initiatives that often do not occur on an annual basis and/or do not provide specific variables; proxy variables are needed when data are not available. INTRODUCTION. Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) has received growing attention, given their links to excessive weight gain and increased risk of obesity, type-2 diabetes and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs).1–5 Arguably, taxation is not punitive but market normalising, as the true costs of SSBs due to public healthcare expenditures and other societal costs from excessive intake are not reflected in current market prices. Thus, by increasing SSB prices relative to other foods, taxes can play a role in decreasing consumption, lowering societal costs and improving societal well-being.6 7 Based on these considerations, a rapidly growing number of countries have implemented or announced national SSB taxes,8 9 including Norway in 1981 and Samoa in 1984; Australia, French Polynesia, Fiji and Nauru between 2000 and 2007 and Finland, Hungary, France, Chile, Mexico, Barbados, St. Helena and Dominica since 2011. In 2018, the Philippines, the UK, South Africa, the Ireland, Peru and Norway implemented SSB taxes. Colombia and Saudi Arabia have included such taxes in recent proposals, while Bermuda, India and Indonesia are considering similar measures. In the USA, more than 30 jurisdictions have implemented or attempted to pass SSB taxes since 2016, including San Francisco and Seattle in 2018.10 11 Despite their growing acceptance globally, the potential impact of SSB taxation on intake remains uncertain, particularly how it might vary across countries, and by age and sex within countries. Most studies of SSB taxation have been limited to a small group of countries or focused on a specific country or jurisdiction where taxes have been implemented.12–17 No study to date has examined SSB consumption and taxation in a global context. In addition, few studies have considered how SSB intake could vary depending on the price of substitute products.18 Because expert organisations are advocating and governments are considering SSB taxation across the globe,19 examining demand in a global context can provide a better understanding of potential tax-policy effectiveness across the complete spectrum of countries, from most to least developed. To investigate this issue, we examined SSB intake across 164 countries and estimated how intake differences within and across countries are influenced by the price of SSBs and substitute caloric beverages (fruit juice and milk), as well as other factors such as national income, age and sex. Based on WHO recommendations,19 we further simulated how SSB intake would respond to a 20% tax (price increase). Tax-policy outcomes were examined across countries by income decile for representative age and sex subgroups. METHODS. Using globally representative intake and pricing data, we implemented a consumer demand modelling framework to examine determinants of SSB intake within and across countries. The modelling framework accounted for age and sex differences and economic determinants such as own price, price of substitutes (fruit juice and milk) and real per capita income at the national level. We also considered the potential for unmeasured region-specific differences, such as taste or other preferences, by including regional binary variables. Model estimates were used to derive SSB own-price elasticities for detailed strata (age, sex and countries by income decile), and to assess the potential impact of taxes on intake. Accounting for these factors, we report price elasticities of SSB intake (measures of the percentage change in intake from a 1% change in price), which have been a primary means of estimating potential tax-policy effectiveness.20 We also evaluated the variability in tax-policy effectiveness and examined outcomes for select age and sex subgroups and countries by income decile. Supplementary file 1. DATA AND SOURCES. Data on SSB intake were derived from the 2010 Global Dietary Database (GDD), a database of global food and nutrient intakes by age (20 to 80 in 5 year intervals) and sex for 187 countries. The SSB category in the GDD includes intake of all sugar-sweetened beverages, including any beverage with added sugar and ≥50 kcal per 8 oz, such as carbonated beverages, sodas, energy drinks, fruit drinks, etc, excluding 100% juices. GDD data collection, statistical methods, data validation and findings have been described in detail (also see http://www.globaldietarydatabase.org/).21–25 In brief, GDD data were derived based on national and subnational dietary surveys, informed by additional information from United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation food balance sheets data, individual-level surveys from cohort studies, household expenditure surveys when dietary surveys were not available, as well as other data sources such as the WHO Global Infobase and the WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS) data.25.

31447725,"Measuring Counterintuitiveness in Supernatural Agent Dream Imagery. INTRODUCTION. Supernatural agent concepts consistently appear in dreams in association with diminished agency in the dreamer (who thus loses individual agency and ego), which may facilitate supernatural agent cognitions related to religious beliefs. The anthropological and religious research literature tends to demonstrate that dreaming, dream experience and narratives found in traditional societies connect to other religious ideas and practices (e.g., Tylor, 1871; Lincoln, 1935; Tedlock, 1987; Jedrej and Shaw, 1992; Doniger and Bulkeley, 1993; Mageo, 2003; Lohmann, 2003a,b; Bulkeley, 2007, 2008; Laughlin, 2011). Based on analysis of lived and practiced folk-religion from various parts of the world, a notion has developed among scholars characterizing dreaming as the primary source of religion. Such a single “magic bullet” theory is ambiguous, however. A strong case can be made for the notion that supernaturalistic cognition prevails in dreaming processes connected to cultural environments rich in other religious representations. The aim here is to map a particular structure of cognitive content using Barrett’s counterintuitiveness coding and quantifying scheme (CI scheme) in allegedly religious dreaming by focusing on supernatural agent imagery and concepts. Are these types of items in subjective dream reports a similar kind of catchy and peculiar content as has been demonstrated from the cultural transmission of other supernaturalistic notions and religious ideas generally? If it can be shown that allegedly religious dream imagery involves similar counterintuitive processing, this would help further explain why dreams cross-culturally tend to have a certain salience, and why these types of experiences and imagery are rendered special value and usefulness in cultural and religious institutions. From the perspective of the broader naturalistic research program of cognitive (and evolutionary) science of religion, many of the kinds of characteristics that occur in these dreams are supernatural agent (SA) concepts. The use of “superhuman” or “supernatural” agents (e.g., ancestors, gods, ghosts, sprits, souls, demons, saints, and even religious experts) is an indication that these notions hold at least an important, and perhaps a constitutive, position in religious beliefs and ritual action (c.f., McCauley and Lawson, 2002). Further, religious dreaming draws upon the same neurocognitive mechanisms as do ordinary dreaming and cognitive processing, as well as the cultural transmission biases that amplify and contextualize the spreading and preservation of representations about dreaming. It has been noted that, with some exceptions (e.g., Bulkeley, 2007; Nordin, 2011; McNamara and Bulkeley, 2015; McNamara, 2016), dreaming has not garnered much attention in the cognitive science of religion and related fields (c.f., Bulkeley, 2004, p. 22; Taves, 2008). While anthropological literature points to the cross-cultural pervasiveness of supernaturalism in dreams, and the cognitive science of religion has paid a lot of attention to the cognitive and or functional peculiarities of supernaturalism, there are very little cross-cultural data and research on the cognition of supernatural dreaming. Religious and supernatural agent dream imagery tends to be ritualized, and is awarded special (sacred) value and cultural institutionalization related to interpretive rationalization and modus operandi. But why should dreaming produce supernatural agent imagery? It has been suggested that this sort of imagery and related emotional activation are generated from evolved threat simulation processes during sleep (Bulkeley, 2007; Nordin, 2011). Such a system is perhaps part a grander evolved system for agent-related threat detection (Nordin, 2011) that has been described as the hypersensitive agent detection device or HADD (Barrett, 2004a,b; c.f., Guthrie, 1993) and is tied to theory of mind attribution. Such a model suggests that HADD and threat simulation make use of an increased inclination to simulate and detect agency in situations of urgency and uncertainty. Dreams and nightmares with salient content, strong negative emotions, and existential anxiety create urgent concern. Perhaps the sensed urgency in dreams would contribute to supernatural beliefs, since these concepts are particularly salient and inferentially rich (strategic knowledge and morality); and are usually already available in the believer’s explanatory repertoire. And consequently, the intentions of extraordinary agents with extraordinary properties are likely to be believed to be the cause or content of the dream (Nordin, 2011). This may be the case because, according to HADD, salient dreams may be conceived as traces or communicative signs from other agents (Barrett, 2004a,b). However, supernatural agent dream imagery is often manifestly extraordinary in some way, and it is consequently not obvious that such imagery connects to inferences that imply a maximal potential for cognitive relevance. On the other hand, why does the dream cognition start to represent extraordinary or counterintuitive properties?

31472753,"Advances in biomarker detection: Alternative approaches for blood-based biomarker detection. In the clinical setting, a blood sample is typically the starting point for biomarker search and discovery. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a highly sensitive and informative method for characterizing a very wide range of metabolites and proteins and is therefore a potentially powerful tool for biomarker discovery. However, the physicochemical characteristics of blood coupled with very large ranges of protein and metabolite concentrations present a significant technical obstacle for resolving and quantifying putative biomarkers by MS. Blood fractionation procedures are being developed to reduce the proteome/metabolome complexity and concentration ranges, allowing a greater diversity of analytes, including those at very low concentrations, to be quantified. In this chapter, several strategies for enriching and/or isolating specific blood components are summarized, including methods for the analysis of low and high molecular weight compounds, usually neglected in this type of assays, extracellular vesicles, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

BACKGROUND The research focused on the evaluation of the impact of cover cropping on trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Co and Cd) and nutrients in vineyard soils and Vitis vinifera L. For this purpose, two types of cover crops (Lolium perenne L. and Medicago sativa L.) and their mixture were planted between vine rows of Muscat white in the vineyard in South Crimea. Trace elements, nutrients and other parameters were analyzed in the soil layers, leaves and grapevines of control and cover cropped plots. RESULTS The effect of cover cropping was dependent on applied plant species. Ryegrass (L. perenne L.) seems to compete with V. vinifera L. for nutrients - these were lower in the soil and vines of the treated plot. In parallel, lead (Pb) bioconcentration in grapevines was reduced. In contrast, under lucerne (M. sativa L.), nitrogen in the soil and vines, and trace metal bioconcentration (Fe, Pb and Co) were higher. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that cover cropping can influence the chemical composition of soil and vines.

31522117,"Structural Basis of Mitochondrial Scaffolds by Prohibitin Complexes: Insight into a Role of the Coiled-Coil Region. SUMMARY. The coiled-coil motif mediates subunit oligomerization and scaffolding and underlies several fundamental biologic processes. Prohibitins (PHBs), mitochondrial inner membrane proteins involved in mitochondrial homeostasis and signal transduction, are predicted to have a coiled-coil motif, but their structural features are poorly understood. Here we solved the crystal structure of the heptad repeat (HR) region of PHB2 at 1.7-Å resolution, showing that it assembles into a dimeric, antiparallel coiled-coil with a unique negatively charged area essential for the PHB interactome in mitochondria. Disruption of the HR coiled-coil abolishes well-ordered PHB complexes and the mitochondrial tubular networks accompanying PHB-dependent signaling. Using a proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) technique in live cells, we mapped a number of mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins whose association with PHB2 relies on the HR coiled-coil region. Elucidation of the PHB complex structure in mitochondria provides insight into essential PHB interactomes required for mitochondrial dynamics as well as signal transduction. INTRODUCTION. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo continual cycles of fusion and fission. The balance of these two processes controls the overall morphology of the mitochondrial population, which contains individual organelles ranging from small isolated spheres to interconnected tubular networks (Westermann, 2010, Chan, 2012, Wai and Langer, 2016). Beyond controlling mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial fusion also enables cooperation between mitochondria and protects the function of the mitochondrial population. Without adequate mitochondrial fusion, mitochondria exist as autonomous organelles, a state that results in greater heterogeneity and dysfunction of the mitochondrial population (Chen et al., 2005). In mammals, mitochondrial fusion is controlled by several conserved large guanosine triphosphatases of the dynamin family that orchestrate mitofusins (MFN1 and MFN2) at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), having eight isoforms resulting by transcriptional and post-translational processes, in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) (Chen and Chan, 2010). Prohibitins (PHBs) are ubiquitously expressed IMM proteins that form ring-like PHB complexes comprising multiple PHB1 and PHB2 subunits (Tatsuta et al., 2005) to maintain the cristae structure and mitochondrial integrity (Artal-Sanz and Tavernarakis, 2009, Osman et al., 2009b). Several lines of evidence indicate that PHB complexes act as a functional platform to sequester mitochondrial proteases from the substrate, OPA1, and control proteolytic processing of the OPA1 balance (coexistence with long and short isoforms) to regulate mitochondrial fusion (Merkwirth et al., 2008 & 2012; Ehses et al., 2009, Richter-Dennerlein et al., 2014, Korwitz et al., 2016). In mice, the absence of PHB complexes is embryonic lethal (Merkwirth et al., 2008), and postnatal neuronal-specific ablation of Phb2 causes neurodegeneration (Merkwirth et al., 2012), defects thought to be linked to the destabilization of fusogenic OPA1. One of the PHB complexes, PHB2, was also recently revealed to act as a crucial receptor for the removal of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy (Wei et al., 2017). Although the embryologic and cellular functions of PHB complexes involved in both mitochondrial morphology and integrity are beginning to be understood, little is known about how these molecules act mechanistically. PHBs have a unique structural motif, a 4,3 hydrophobic heptad repeat ([HR] region: Figure S1A) that is strongly associated with the coiled-coil motif (Figure S1B), which has central roles in protein-protein interactions (Grigoryan and Keating, 2008). The presence of the HR region in mitochondrial proteins is reminiscent of the structure of MFN1, in which the formation of anti-parallel coiled-coil structures mediates mitochondrial tethering (Koshiba et al., 2004). In addition, similar anti-parallel coiled-coils are formed during mitochondrial fission events mediated by dimeric states of mitochondrial division 1 and mitochondrial fission 1 complexes at the OMM (Koirala et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2012). Understanding how PHB molecules are involved in mitochondrial membrane dynamics via the HR region in their putative coiled-coil motifs will fill a critical gap in our knowledge concerning its actions. In the present study, we performed a biophysical and cell biologic analysis of the HR region of PHB2. We found that the HR region of PHB2 forms a dimeric antiparallel coiled-coil with a highly charged surface. Surprisingly, in addition to its self-dimerization, we revealed that this coiled-coil motif mediates the tight assembly of the PHB interactome in mitochondria. Mutations that disrupt the HR coiled-coil or change the HR surface charge properties severely disrupt the PHB interactome assembly, as well as mitochondrial morphology and its functions, indicating that PHB complexes are important for mitochondrial integrity. These structural insights contribute to elucidate the mechanistic roles of PHB complexes essential for mitochondrial functions. RESULTS. HEPTAD REPEAT REGION OF PHB2 IS ESSENTIAL FOR PHB COMPLEXES IN MITOCHONDRIA. To understand the structural basis of PHB complexes in mitochondria through its HR region, we sought to determine interactors that rely on this region. We first established HEK293 cell lines stably expressing either variant 1 (V1: used as the standard variant in this study) or variant 3 (V3: an alternative splicing variant lacking most of the HR sequence) of PHB2 (Figures S1A and S1B), which harbor a C-terminal biotin ligase (BirA) with a hemagglutinin tag, and screened live cells for proximate and interacting proteins. Validating these BirA-fused PHB2 variants biochemically, both recombinants behaved almost identically to endogenous PHB2, showing its potential localization in t",PMC,pos,1,pos,5286,pos_PMC,0.997981,1

31612928,"Treatment with pembrolizumab after hypersensitivity reaction to nivolumab in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. PURPOSE The options for immunotherapy treatment are limited for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. In this case study, we report a case of successful alternation of one PD-1 inhibitor for another after a hypersensitivity reaction. SUMMARY Nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb) has been Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for a variety of malignancies, including a recent approval for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Infusion-related reactions occur in less than 1% of patients, and although such reactions are rare, recognition of infusion-related reactions induced by nivolumab is an important aspect of its usage. The PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab is also FDA approved for subsequent-line therapy in treatment of HCC. Thus far, approximately 0.2% of patients experienced severe infusion-related reaction in studies using pembrolizumab. A 70-year-old male with HCC had an infusion reaction to nivolumab that presented as facial flushing, dyspnea, and back pain. The patient received prompt administration of diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone, which led to the amelioration of symptoms and allowed the patient to complete his immunotherapy treatment. For the third dose of nivolumab, the patient received premedications prior to treatment, including diphenhydramine, hydrocortisone, and famotidine. During his infusion, the patient experienced facial flushing, coughing, chest tightness, and an itchy throat. The patient again received diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone to treat infusion-related symptoms and his therapy was discontinued. Because of the nivolumab infusion-related reaction, nivolumab was discontinued, and the patient was started on pembrolizumab. The patient tolerated pembrolizumab without any subsequent infusion-related reactions. Prompt recognition and attention to immunotherapy infusion-related reactions could potentially prevent the fatal complication of anaphylaxis with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this report, we describe the successful transition from one anti-PD-1 therapy to another for continued immunotherapy treatment without any subsequent infusion reactions.

31724707,"'Drc', a structurally novel ssDNA-binding transcription regulator of N4-related bacterial viruses. INTRODUCTION. The availability of sequencing technologies has led to a vast increase in available genome sequences of microorganisms. Consequently, the number of unknown open reading frames whose products are termed ‘ORFans’, continues to increase. These ORFans have no sequence similarity to known sequences, which makes it hard to predict their function (1). Research on ORFans often results in discovery of very diverged known proteins or sometimes entirely new classes and folds (2–5). As such, their analysis can vastly expand the set of known structural folds and domains, which in turn will allow improved structural and functional predictions. Bacterial viruses encode a vast array of ORFans (35% of their ORFs), of which about a third are shared by fewer than five different bacteriophages (6). Many phage ORFans are expressed immediately after infection and are likely required for host takeover (7). Indeed, several ORFans have been shown to mediate crucial host processes in very distinct and unique ways (8). Apart from the search for new functionalities, domains and folds, the study of these ORFans is key to understanding host reprogramming in the course of infection and can lead to novel antibacterial strategies (9) or discovery of new biotechnological tools (7,10–12). Multiple studies have been conducted to harness ORFans potential, mostly using screening-based techniques. These range from mapping the protein–protein interaction networks within the phage (13) or with the host (14–16), to observation of phage phenotypes upon gene deletions (17), or host phenotypes upon phage genes expression (9,18,19). While these screens provide vital clues, further in-depth experimentation is required to fully unravel the function of an individual ORFan. Here we focus on a small ORFan protein (gp14) from Pseudomonas virus LUZ7, which was identified as toxic to the host in one such screen (18). LUZ7 gp14 causes filamentous growth of the host, but to date no host protein interaction partners have been found, despite an extensive yeast two-hybrid screen (18). We demonstrate that gp14 (here termed Drc, ssDNA-binding RNA Polymerase cofactor) interacts with single-strand DNA (ssDNA) by means of a unique ssDNA-binding protein (SSB) fold. Additionally, by showing interaction with the phage-encoded RNA Polymerase (RNAPII), we establish the biological role of Drc in the transcription regulation of the N4-related Pseudomonas virus LUZ7. Drc is likely involved in the same process as the coliphage N4-encoded gp2 protein, which mediates the recruitment of the viral RNAPII complex to its single-stranded promoters (20). Even though N4-related viruses have a generally conserved transcriptional progression scheme, further phylogenetic analysis unveils that there is diversity of transcription-activating SSB proteins across the N4-like phage genera. MATERIALS AND METHODS. CONSTRUCTION OF EXPRESSION PLASMIDS. Genomic LUZ7 DNA was used to amplify ORF14, ORF20 and ORF22. ORF14 was amplified using primers 5′-ATGGATCCATGGCACTCGTCAAGAAGAA-3′ and 5′-CTGAATTCTTACAGGTCGAGCGCG-3′ prior to restriction cloning in pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) with BamHI and EcoRI, which results in Drc having an N-terminal GST-tag fusion. ORF20 and ORF22 were cloned in MCS1 and MCS2 of pRSFDuet-1 (Novagen) using BamHI and SacI or NdeI and KpnI, respectively. Primer pairs 5′-GTAGGATCCTCACCCAACTCTAATGCTC-3′ and 5′-GACGAGCTCTCATTTGGTAATCCTCAGATG-3′ or 5′-GATCATATGAAGCGTTACACTGGCTTTG-3′ and 5′-CTTGGTACCTTAAGACAGGGCATACTCACTCTC-3′, were used for their PCR amplification. The resulting plasmid encodes an N-terminally 6xHis-tagged RNAP1 subunit and untagged RNAP2 subunit. Drc.Y23A was created by a modified inverse PCR (21). In short, two non-overlapping primers of which one contains the desired mutation (5′-CAACAAGGGCGCTTCGGCCGCCCTGAACTTCCACTTC-3′, 5′-TCGGTGGCTTGGGTGTTGCGAGCTTGGTTC-3′), were phosphorylated with PNK (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and used to amplify 150 pg of template plasmid. The amplicon was then purified by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ligation, propagation and sequencing of the plasmid. The same process was used to add a C-terminal Strep-tag II to the RNAP2 subunit, using primers 5′-TAAGGTACCCTCGAGTCTGGTAAAGAAAC-3′ and 5′-TTTTTCGAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCAAGCGCTAGACAGGGCATACTCACTCTC-3′. Drc(Δ67–99) was cloned into pEXP-5-CT/TOPO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after amplification from LUZ7 genomic DNA with primers 5′-ATGGCACTCGTCAAGAAGAAC-3′ and 5′-CAGCGGCTTGCCCTTGTC-3′, thus encoding a C-terminally 6xHis-tagged protein. ORF14 was also cloned into pEXP-5-CT/TOPO with primers 5′-ATGGCACTCGTCAAGAAGAAC-3′ and 5′-TTACAGGTCGAGCGCGCGCTC-3′, after which a Strep-tag II was added by inverse PCR with primers 5′-AGCGCTTGGAGCCACCCGCAGTTCGAAAAATAAAAGGGTCATCATCACCATC-3′ and 5′-CAGGTCGAGCGCGCGCTC-3′. EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION OF GST-TAGGED PROTEINS (DRC AND DRC.Y23A). All expressions were done with Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS expression strains. Cells were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37°C to OD600 of 0.6. Expression was then induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and cells were grown for an additional 4h at 37°C. The culture was pelleted by centrifugation (4600 g, 4°C). Cells were resuspended in Lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 100 μM PefaBloc SC (Merck), 2 mg/ml HEW Lysozyme (Sigma)), freeze-thawed three times, DNase I treated (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and pulse-sonicated on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 60 000 g and filtered over a 0.22 μm filter (Merck). This cleared lysate was purified on an ÄKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare) by affinity chromatography using a 5 ml GSTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). Before loading, the column was equilibrated with wash buffer (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.3).

31748421,"CD8+ Tc2 cells: underappreciated contributors to severe asthma. The complex heterogeneity of asthma is reflected in the number of cell types, mediators and pathways described in the pathogenesis of this syndrome[1]. The clinical variability between patients and even in the same patient at different stages of their disease suggest different mechanistic pathways[2, 3]. T lymphocytes play a major role in the pathophysiology of asthma, but that alone does not address involvement of the many different subsets of T cells. Moreover, the pathogenesis of asthma has been linked to the production of type 2 cytokines, which can be expressed by several cell types in the lung. Type 2 CD4+ T cells (Th2) and their capacity to secrete pro-allergic cytokines, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, dominate descriptions of asthma pathogenesis[4], particularly eosinophilic and corticosteroid-responsive asthma. Innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2), which are lineage negative and lack a T cell receptor (TCR), have received attention based on their early presence and capacity for similar type 2 cytokine production[5]. Th9 cells act via IL-9 to enhance pro-allergic cytokine expression, airway mast cell recruitment, eosinophilia, airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus cell metaplasia in murine models[6]. Th17 cells and their release of IL-17 are proposed to trigger a neutrophilic response in the airways leading to corticosteroid-refractory asthma[7], although, to date, blockade of IL-9[8] and IL-17[9] have not proved effective in clinical trials. Invariant natural killer T cells were implicated in promoting airway hyper responsiveness in mice[10], although these cells proved to be rare in human airways[11], in contrast to the abundant mucosal associated invariant T cell subset[12]. Countering these pro-allergic lymphocyte responses are regulatory T cells, natural and inducible, attenuating asthma responses through secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β[13–15]. In contrast to CD4+ T cells, the role of CD8+ T cells, was suggested to balance the responses of CD4+ T cells through the secretion of IFN-γ[16]. However, until recently few studies have directly examined the presence or role of CD8+ T cells in asthma pathogenesis. Nonetheless, in experimental models and where they have been examined in human asthma, CD8+ T cells were proposed to play an important role in asthma pathogenesis, in large part because they are insensitive to corticosteroids compared with CD4+ T cells and because they have the capacity to undergo transcriptional reprogramming from IFN-γ secreting cells (Tc1) to type 2 cytokine secreting cells (Tc2), especially producing IL-13 and IL-5[17]. These two factors position CD8+ Tc2 cells as potentially important effector cells in asthma pathogenesis, especially in severe, corticosteroid-resistant asthma. CORTICOSTEROID INSENSITIVE ASTHMA. Corticosteroids have multiple mechanisms of action so it is likely that their effects in asthma occur via several mechanisms, acting on corticosteroid-sensitive cells which undergo apoptosis or in attenuating susceptible pathways and functional programs. Although corticosteroids remain “first-line therapy” in asthma, increasingly there is a recognition that some patients experience severe asthma with persistent symptoms despite high dose inhaled or oral corticosteroids[18]. It is likely that other cell types and pathways, which are corticosteroid-resistant, underlie the immunopathology in these individuals, labelled as corticosteroid-resistant asthmatics. Furthermore, corticosteroids have incomplete efficacy in preventing or treating exacerbations[19, 20], supporting this notion that the diverse triggers for these events (Table 1) involve distinct cell types which are more intrinsically corticosteroid-resistant, including neutrophils, Th17 cells[21] and potentially CD8+ T cells[17]. It is for this group of severe asthmatics that many of the newer biologic agents have been targeted. CD8+ TC2 CELLS IN EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC AIRWAYS DISEASE. In addition to CD4+ Th2 cells and type 2 ILCs, the role of type 2 cytokine secreting CD8+ Tc2 cells in allergic airways disease has been demonstrated extensively in models of experimental asthma. A number of studies in mice reported that CD8+ T cells play a protective role in allergic disease[22–26]. Regulatory or suppressive effects on lung allergic responses were associated with secretion of type 1 cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-γ [16, 25, 26]. In contrast, the plasticity of CD8+ T cells and their pro-asthmatic activities have now been confirmed in many studies. Depletion of CD8+ T cells attenuated AHR and airway inflammation in mice exposed to allergen exclusively via the airways, in the absence of systemic sensitization[27]. The responses were restored following reconstitution of CD8+ T cells, but not IL-13-deficient CD8+ T cells. CD8+ Tc2 cells have been shown to be prime sources of type 2 cytokines[28–32]. Mice deficient in CD8 develop significantly lower AHR, eosinophilic inflammation and interleukin (IL)-13 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with wild-type mice, and these responses are restored by adoptive transfer of antigen-primed CD8+ T cells[24, 28, 33]. The capacity of CD8+ T cells to produce type 2 cytokines in mice was dependent on interactions between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with allergen-sensitized CD4+ T cells providing the critical differentiation factor, IL-4[28]. TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPROGRAMMING OF CD8+ T CELLS FROM A TC1 TO A TC2 PHENOTYPE. CD8+ T cells, similar to other T-cell subsets, exhibit plasticity and can undergo transcriptional reprogramming, redirecting their functional activities. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells committed to IFNγ production, when exposed to IL-4 in vitro or in an atopic environment, transit through distinct differentiation stages characterized by changes in transcription and translation, resulting in IL-13-producing CD8+ T cells[34] (Figure 1). In CD8+ T cells, IL-4 resulted in the epigenetic poising of the Il13 locus through the gain of permissive and loss of repressi",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,5329,far_neg_PMC,0.00997492,0
31901088,"Myosin VI maintains the actin-dependent organization of the tubulobulbar complexes required for endocytosis during mouse spermiogenesis†‡. INTRODUCTION. The formation of fully differentiated sperm is a result of dynamic morphological and biochemical changes that occur during spermiogenesis. In mammals, developing/maturing spermatids are surrounded by somatic Sertoli cell actin-based hoops that form a testis-specific adherens junction at the Sertoli-spermatid interface, known as the apical ectoplasmic specialization (ES) [1]. Functional organization of the apical ES and remodeling of its actin component is driven by the activity of different actin-binding/regulating proteins (ABPs), which enable the movement of spermatids in the seminiferous epithelium. At the late phase of spermiogenesis, the apical ES is replaced by highly specialized endocytic structure of membranes and actin filaments (AFs) called the apical TBC (Figure 1a and b). These unique complexes are formed at stage VII of the seminiferous epithelium cycle in mouse and have been suggested to play a role in the internalization and recycling of adhering junctions of the apical ES and thus are crucial for the sperm release during spermiation [2, 3]. The TBC consists of finger-like double-membraned invaginations of the Sertoli cell and the spermatid plasma membranes. The long neck of each invagination is stabilized and cuffed by an actin meshwork, followed by an actin-free region that extends into a bulb. This swollen bulb closely associates with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and terminates at the distal end in a clathrin-coated pit (Figure 1c). In addition to clathrin, two other marker proteins of the endocytic pathway have been localized to the TBCs—Rab5 [4] and its effector, the early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) [5]. Whereas Rab5 localizes to the bulbular region, EEA1 is present on large endocytic vesicles [6]. Thus, endocytosis of cell surface receptors for degradation or recycling might occur at the TBCs by the formation of Rab5-positive vesicles at the bulbs, which then fuse and mature into EEA1-positive early endosomes (Figure 1b). Indeed, it was recently suggested that junctional complexes are internalized at the apical TBCs to be recycled to newly formed intercellular junctions in other parts of the Sertoli cell [7]. Various ABPs involved in F-actin dynamics have been shown to drive the TBC formation/function, including actin cross-linker Arp2/3 complex and its activator cortactin, actin depolymerization factor cofilin, and actin regulators such as paxillin, vinculin, espin, Eps8/15 and N-WASP [8–10]. In addition, actin-based trafficking involving motor protein myosin VIIa has also been implicated in the apical ES/TBCs restructuring in mammals [11, 12]. Thus, the presence of the actin component and related proteins on these testis-specific structures during the late phase of spermiogenesis suggests that successful spermiation relies on the regulation of actin-based processes. MYO6 is a unique motor protein, because unlike all the other myosins characterized so far, it moves towards the minus ends of AFs [13]. This myosin has been implicated in a wide range of cellular pathways including endocytosis, exocytosis, autophagy, maintenance of apical microvilli in polarized epithelial cells, and streocilia in inner ear hair cells as well as regulation of actin dynamics [14]. In these processes, MYO6 may function as a motor involved in intracellular transport or as an anchor essential in tethering membranes or protein complexes to the actin cytoskeleton. This unique ability results from MYO6 interactions with different cargo adaptors affecting its oligomerization [14]. For instance, during endocytosis, MYO6 may dimerize/oligomerize by interacting with GIPC1, regulating early endosomes positioning and cargo sorting [15]. On the other hand, MYO6 may act as a monomer while binding to TOM1/L2, thereby enabling tethering of endosomes to promote their fusion with autophagosomes [16]. A crucial role for MYO6 in Drosophila spermiogenesis, called spermatid individualization, was previously identified [17]. During this process, stable actin structures (cones) drive transformation of the syncytial spermatids into individual sperm by removing excess cytoplasm and membrane remodeling. MYO6 stabilizes a dense actin meshwork at the front of the cones as they move from the spermatid nuclei to the tails, which is required to complete spermiogenesis [17, 18]. The lack of MYO6 in Drosophila testis causes abnormal structure of the actin cones and loss of selected ABPs from the front of the cones and results in sterile male flies [19, 20]. These data suggest that MYO6 plays a structural role during Drosophila spermatid individualization. Our previous results also suggest a role for MYO6 in mouse spermiogenesis as this myosin is expressed in wild-type mice testes and localizes to actin-rich structures necessary for spermatid development/maturation, including the apical ES [21]. Moreover, it has been suggested that MYO6-deficient Snell’s waltzer (sv/sv) male mice show reduced fertility [22]. To further investigate the role of MYO6 in the late phase of spermiogenesis in mouse, we analyze here the impact of loss of MYO6 function on spatial organization of the TBC-related endocytic compartment using testis from the sv/sv and control mice. We identified defects in the actin cytoskeleton at the TBCs and the distribution of the APPL1-positive endosomes. Finally, we show significantly reduced litter size in Snell’s waltzer mice linked to male fertility. MATERIALS AND METHODS. ANIMALS.

31910901,"Mitochondrial localization of Dictyostelium discoideum dUTPase mediated by its N-terminus. INTRODUCTION. The nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of Dictyostelium discoideum are 78% and 73% AT, respectively [1, 2], creating a substantial requirement for dUMP, the precursor for dTTP, during mitotic cell growth as well as during development when DNA replication also occurs [3–5]. To understand how the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway accommodates the demand for dTTP, we began to focus on a key enzyme of the pathway, deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase or dUTPase, which hydrolyzes dUTP to pyrophosphate and dUMP; dUMP is subsequently converted to dTTP. Concomitantly, a high dTTP to dUTP ratio is ensured, thus minimizing the incorporation of uracil during DNA synthesis [6]. The curated genome of the soil amoeba D. discoideum shows a single gene (DictyBase Gene ID DDB_G0293374; [7]) predicted to encode a dUTPase polypeptide containing the five hallmark motifs (M1–M5) of homotrimeric dUTPases [8], seen in the alignments of the amino acid sequences from mustard, yeast and human (Fig. 1a). While the dUTPases of Arabidopsis thaliana and D. discoideum have substantial stretches of identity (73%) within the 138-residue segment containing M1–M5 [9], their N-termini have very low sequence similarity to each other, and to the human and yeast N-termini. Notably, within the lengthy N-terminus of the D. discoideum dUTPase, atypical of most dUTPases, computational analyses predict a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). MAIN TEXT. RESULTS. A SINGLE GENE CODES FOR AN ACTIVE ENZYME IN THE HOMOTRIMERIC DUTPASE FAMILY. To characterize the unusual D. discoideum dUTPase, we established first that the recombinant protein was an active dUTPase and determined its kinetic parameters. Also catalytically-active was a core version comprised of polypeptide subunits that retain M1–M5 but lack residues 1-37 of the N-terminus. A homotrimeric structure of the core dUTPase enzyme was confirmed by crystallographic analyses that additionally showed interactions of the shorter N-termini with the C-termini likely enhanced substrate access of the dUTP substrate to the active sites. Recombinant His-tagged dUTPase proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified by metal-chelating chromatography and after removal of the His-tag, assayed for activity by measuring the release of protons with the pH indicator cresol red (Additional file 1: Text S1). As determined by the kinetic parameters calculated from stopped-flow measurements (Fig. 1b, c and Table 1), the kcat/KM of the core protein, lacking N-terminal residues 1-37 (Fig. 1a), was 60-fold greater than that of the full-length species, indicating the core was a more efficient enzyme. Activity assays using an end-point method showed the full-length and core dUTPases both were metal-dependent enzymes inhibited by EDTA. Mg2+ was identified as the optimal divalent cation (Additional file 2: Table S1), as seen with homotrimeric dUTPases [6]. Both proteins specifically used dUTP (≤ 1% hydrolysis of other dNTPs; data not shown) and exhibited optimal activities at 60 °C and pH 8 (Additional file 3: Fig. S1). The catalytically efficient core dUTPase indicated that the 37 N-terminal residues were not essential for activity. The crystal structure of the core dUTPase showed it to be a homotrimer, indicating that the absent 37 N-terminal residues were dispensable for oligomer formation (Additional file 3: Fig. S2; PDB ID 5F9K). In most homotrimeric dUTPases, the C-termini, containing M5 which aids in coordinating the ligand at the active site, are flexible. In the core structure, PISA interaction analyses revealed that the shorter N-termini interacted with the C-termini of adjacent subunits, constraining their engagement with their respective active sites. The interactions are schematically shown for Chains A and C, and Chains B and A (Fig. 1d). The limited movement of the C-termini contributed to the different inhibitor coordinates in each active site of the core dUTPase (Additional file 3: Fig. S2, insets). Notable is the position of Inhibitor B. Interactions (hydrogen bonds and salt bridges) by three glutamates of the C-terminus of Chain C with residues of the N-terminus of Chain A (E120::H3+F5, E123::K5 and E126::K9) produced the most displaced orientation compared to Inhibitors A and C (detailed in Additional file 3: Fig. S3). The C-termini, which act normally as lids for the substrate binding pockets [10–12], instead were restricted in their movement, which may have allowed increased access of dUTP to the three active sites compared to the full-length protein with its extended N-termini. We postulate this to be why the core enzyme was more catalytically efficient in vitro compared to the full-length dUTPase. THE N-TERMINUS OF D. DISCOIDEUM DUTPASE CONTAINS A MITOCHONDRIAL TARGETING SEQUENCE. The role of the N-terminus of the D. discoideum dUTPase was explored first by expressing in Ax2 cells a full-length dUTPase with GFP at the C-terminus of the polypeptide subunit (Fig. 2a). By microscopy, the fusion protein was observed to localize to Mitotracker™–labeled mitochondria (Fig. 2b). This finding supported the hypothesis that dUTPase is a mitochondrial protein. It also raised the possibility that an MTS resides within the N-terminus. Contrary to expectations, nuclei did not display any GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2c). A helical wheel projection showed that N-terminal residues 1–20 of dUTPase formed an amphipathic helix [13] (Fig. 2e), with a net positive charge, a characteristic common to presequences of imported mitochondrial proteins [14]. Programs predicting targeting sequences indicated a high probability of dUTPase to be located in mitochondria, when fungi were used in the organism category, with cleavage after Leu18 upon import into the organelle (BaCelLo [15], MitoFates [16], MitoProt II [17]). As a test for the presence of an MTS within the N-terminus of dUTPase, we added the forty N-terminal residues of dUTPase to GFP, producing N1–40-dUTPase-GFP (Fig. 2a).

31929078,"Estimating the remaining atmospheric environmental capacity using a single-box model in a high pollution risk suburb of Chengdu, China. The atmospheric pollution has been the public attention in recent years. In order to better coordinate economic development and atmospheric environmental management, China introduced the concept of atmospheric environmental capacity (AEC). The remaining atmospheric environmental capacity (RAEC) calculated by existing atmospheric pollution sources and AEC is an important basis for regional development and environmental protection. The RAEC of the high-pollution risk suburb of Chengdu in 2015 was estimated by the single-box model and analyzed on multiple time scales. The results show that the RAEC of SO2 and NO2 in this region is 3299 t/a and 2849 t/a, respectively under the annual time scale. However, in the daily time scale, the RAEC of NO2 is negative for 3 days, that is, there are 3 days with serious air pollution. Therefore, it is not appropriate to plan the industrial area only by relying on annual RAEC. Especially, RAEC displays inter-seasonal and monthly variability. On the one hand, in plain areas with low wind speed and little change in wind direction, achieving the prediction of atmospheric mixing layer height could give early warning of atmospheric pollution events. On the other hand, different management measures are taken on different time scales. On a long timescale, the regional energy structure should be optimized. On seasonal and monthly time scales, the production plans should be adapted to RAEC. On the daily time scale, it mainly deals with the serious atmospheric pollution accident timely.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,5362,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.001810211,0
31951201,"Structure of the human BBSome core complex. INTRODUCTION. Ciliary research had a rocky trail to travel since the discovery of cilia in 1675 as the first known organelle by Antony Van Leeuwenhoek. Although primary cilia have long been thought to be only minor players in the cellular opera (Bloodgood, 2009), they perform key functions as cellular antennae. Primary cilia contain a plethora of crucial signaling proteins with important sensory and regulatory functions particularly in development and cell signaling (Satir, 2017; Nachury, 2014). Since cilia do not contain a protein synthesis machinery, a key question of ciliary research is how proteins are transported to, from and within the cilium. The BBSome is a cargo adaptor that recognizes a diverse set of membrane-bound ciliary proteins. It binds with its cargo to the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex, a large heterooligomeric protein complex that is transported along ciliary microtubules by the molecular motors dynein and kinesin (Wingfield et al., 2018; Stepanek and Pigino, 2016). Interestingly, the BBSome is also involved in the assembly and stabilization of the IFT complex (Wei et al., 2012; Ou et al., 2005), with varying impact on IFT stability in different organisms (Wei et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2014; Pan et al., 2006; Lechtreck et al., 2009). It has been proposed that the BBSome is assembled in a sequential order starting from a complex of BBS7, BBS chaperonins and the CCT/TRiC complex, which acts as a scaffold for further BBSome subunits to be added (Zhang et al., 2012a). However, this route cannot hold true in Drosophila, where the BBSome components BBS2 and BBS7 are missing. The lack of these domains in Drosophila raises in general the question whether these subunits are important for central BBsome functions such as cargo and membrane binding or if they are mostly involved in cilia-specific processes that require the interaction with the IFT complex. In line with this, Drosophila and other organisms with a small number of ciliated cells lack the IFT proteins IFT25 and IFT27 (Zhang et al., 2017), which are considered to be the anchor points for the BBSome on the IFT complex (Liew et al., 2014; Eguether et al., 2014; Lechtreck, 2015). It is therefore conceivable that BBS2 and BBS7 perform functions that are mostly relevant in the context of the cilium, while the other BBSome subunits BBS1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 18 represent a core complex with an independent set of functions, some of which might be relevant outside the cilium. BBS1 emerged to be the most important BBSome subunit for cargo recognition, with several described interactions with ciliary cargo proteins (Jin et al., 2010; Seo et al., 2011; Su et al., 2014; Seo et al., 2009; Bhogaraju et al., 2013; Ruat et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012b). The BBSome is recruited to membranes by the small GTPase Arl6 (Jin et al., 2010), which binds to the N-terminal β-propeller domain of BBS1. The crystal structures of this domain in complex with Arl6 (Mourão et al., 2014), as well as the β-propeller of BBS9 (24), provide the only currently available high-resolution structural information on BBSome subdomains. While this manuscript was in preparation, the medium-resolution structure of a BBSome complex purified from bovine retina was reported (Chou et al., 2019). The structure revealed that BBS2 and BBS7 form a top lobe that blocks the Arl6 interaction site on BBS1. The complex, however, has been purified by affinity chromatography using Arl6 as bait. This suggests that the conformation of the BBsome in its apo state differs from that of the complex bound to Arl6. Although the cryo-EM structure at 4.9 Å revealed the overall domain architecture of the complex, an atomic model could not be accurately built due to the limited resolution. However, this is needed to fully understand the interactions of the domains and the mechanism underlying cargo binding and membrane interaction. We recently reconstituted a heterologously expressed core complex of the human BBSome, comprising the subunits BBS1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 18 (Klink et al., 2017). Although this complex lacks BBS2 and BBS7, it binds with up to sub-micromolar binding affinity to cargo proteins. In addition, we found that strongly binding ciliary trafficking motifs contain stretches of aromatic and positively charged residues, many of which were located in the third intracellular loop and the C-terminal domain of ciliary GPCRs. Multiple binding epitopes on cargo proteins cooperatively interact with multiple subunits of the BBSome (Klink et al., 2017), which is consistent with previous reports (Jin et al., 2010). A detailed insight of how these motifs interact with the BBSome requires a full molecular model of the complex to evaluate the potential interaction surfaces on the side-chain level. Here we report the structure of the human BBSome core complex at an average resolution of 3.8 Å for BBS1, 4, 8, 9, and 18 and 4.3 Å for BBS5. The high quality of the map allowed us to build an atomic model of ~80% of the complex. The structure reveals the architecture of the complex and the sophisticated intertwined arrangement of its subunits. A large positively charged region on the surface of the complex suggests how it orients on the negatively charged ciliary membrane. We found that the complex adopts a conformation in which the Arl6 binding site would be accessible. The high-resolution structure allows us to accurately locate pathogenic patient mutations and to decipher how they perturb intra- and/or intermolecular interactions on the molecular level. We identified a negatively charged cleft in the center of the complex, which is positioned favorably for cargo interactions. Based on these findings, we propose a model for how membrane-bound ciliary cargo proteins like GPCRs can bind to the BBSome. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. ARCHITECTURE OF THE BBSOME CORE.

PURPOSE Dirofilariasis caused by the filarial nematode Dirofilaria repens is mainly a disease of dogs and other carnivores. Also, humans can be accidentally infected with this parasite. The infective third-stage filariform larvae are transmitted by various species of mosquitoes. Until this day, a total of 17 human cases caused by D. repens have been diagnosed in Slovakia, 11 subcutaneous, 4 ocular, 1 pulmonary and 1 in the epididymis. The aim of this report was to describe an unusual clinical case of dirofilariasis of the scrotum. METHODS Extirpated worm was subjected to the molecular and histological identification. PCR for the amplification of cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) was performed using specific D. repens primer pair. RESULTS Here we document the 13th case of human dirofilariasis in a 46-year-old man from southwestern Slovakia. Very rare in humans, genital involvement manifests itself as pseudotumor nodule affecting the epididymis. The patient consulted a general practitioner due to a palpable subcutaneous lump in the scrotum. Routine laboratory analysis revealed blood eosinophilia (16.6%). The ultrasound examination was indicated, and subsequently, surgical excision of the right epididymal nodule was performed. On the basis of histological microscopic examination and PCR-based detection, the helminth was identified as Dirofilaria repens. This represents the ninth case of autochthonous dirofilariasis in Slovakia. CONCLUSIONS The majority of D. repens infections were recorded in southwestern regions of Slovak Republic, which are considered to be endemic areas for canine dirofilariasis.

31970354,"Microphysiological heart-liver body-on-a-chip system with a skin mimic for evaluating topical drug delivery. INTRODUCTION. One of the most challenging problems faced by pharmacology and biotechnology companies is the low success rate of compounds that make it to regulatory approval. Success rates of compounds range from 26% (for haematology compounds) to 5% (oncology drugs) with an overall success rate of 9.6% for all indications. This low percentage of approval is mostly due to the low accuracy of prediction of preclinical in vitro and in vivo models for drug efficacy and toxicity in humans. In the last few decades multi-organ microphysiological systems technology (also known as “body-on-a-chip”) has emerged as a possible solution to increase the predictive power for human response to drugs. To achieve this purpose there is a need to improve the complexity of the systems by adding different organ tissues to the same chip and to be able to test different drug delivery methods. Drug toxicity can affect several tissues, however compounds that have been withdrawn from trials were mostly those that cause hepatoxicity and cardiotoxicity. Although most drugs have better bioavailability and consequently are more effective through oral administration, transdermal drug delivery is a successful method for administrating a compound for prolonged periods of time that can reduce this risk of toxicity. For that reason, it is relevant to develop a multi-organ system that efficiently evaluates the toxicity of topically administrated drugs to human heart and liver tissues. Diclofenac sodium, ketoconazol, acetaminophen and hydrocortisone are well known drugs with topical and oral formulations clinically available. Diclofenac sodium is a phenylacetic acid derivative and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indicated for pain and inflammation management. Oral formulations of diclofenac sodium have been shown to induce a variety of gastrointestinal side effects such as perforations and ulcerations and in some cases hepatic and cardiovascular complications have been reported. To minimize the potential side effects from oral diclofenac formulations, topical formulations have been developed. Ketoconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal derived from imidazole and is mostly indicated for superficial and systemic mycosis (ketoconazole hepatoxicity). Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a drug safety communication involving the use of oral ketoconazole due to potential fatal drug induced liver injury. Ketoconazole is also administered topically, generally in the form of cream or suspensions. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic version of the hormone cortisol which is produced by the adrenal cortex. Hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid and is often used as a standard therapy for patients with adrenal insufficiency. Finally, acetaminophen is a widely used non-narcotic analgesic and antipyretic agent used for pain relief and to treat fever. Acetaminophen is relatively safe when consumed in the recommended doses, however, ingestion of large doses can cause severe liver injury. Recent reports have suggested that acetaminophen could induce acute liver failure even at lower doses. Current in vitro models have a variety of limitations and there are few manuscripts detailing systems demonstrating inclusion of skin and other barrier tissues in a functional multi-organ system . Cell based skin-on-a-chip models have been more physiologically relevant alternative model compared to traditional monolayer cell culture, however the precise control of the skin microenviroment, the inability to recapitulate the heterogeneous nature of the skin which can affect the permeation rate of drugs are important challenges that need to be addressed . Furthermore, few skin-on-a-chip models integrate other organs such as heart and liver, and are not able to evaluate the toxicity and effect of drugs in these important tissues. In this work, we have developed a new microphysiological heart-liver (HL) body-on-a-chip system with a skin surrogate for testing drug toxicity associated with transdermal drug delivery. We have evaluated diclofenac, ketoconazole, hydrocortisone and acetaminophen by topical and systemic administration to evaluate the toxicity prediction of the system. This platform efficiently predicted drug toxicity not only from acute drug exposure but also for chronic drug treatment, which is an important feature needed for in vitro technology for drug testing. Another advantage of the system is the real time assessment of cardiac organ function. This new technological finding ultimately could assist in the design of clinical trial protocols and reduce the cost, time and labour of drug development. EXPERIMENTAL. MICROFABRICATION. Microfluidic housings were designed and fabricated as previously described using poly (methyl methacrylate) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer sheets. The medium recirculates between 2 reservoirs through a microfluidic network formed by the PDMS gaskets, with flow driven by a rocking platform. Drug dosing was applied either A) at a construct containing a Strat-M membrane (Millipore) acting as a barrier between the air and the medium for topical application or B) at the reservoir closest to the liver chamber for systemic application. A cantilever bioMEMS device for measuring cardiac force contained an array of two rows of microscale cantilevers (4 μm thick, 100 μm wide, and 750 μm long), with 16 cantilevers per row. Custom patterned MEA chips, for cardiac electrical measurements, were fabricated using standard microfabrication procedures following a previously described protocol . The surface of each chip was coated with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG)-containing silane, and this PEG layer was patterned by selective ablation using a 193 nm ArF excimer laser (Lambda Physik, Santa Clara, CA).

32051419,"Tripartite phase separation of two signal effectors with vesicles priming B cell responsiveness. INTRODUCTION. Ligation of the BCR by cognate antigen results in the recruitment and activation of the cytosolic spleen tyrosine kinase Syk that in turn phosphorylates the enzymatically inert adapter protein SLP65, also called B cell linker protein (BLNK). Apart from its C-terminal SH2 domain, SLP65 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that contains multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites and proline-rich motifs (PRMs) to interact in a specific manner with SH2 and SH3 domain-containing ligands, respectively. Phosphorylated SLP65 recruits Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and Phospholipase C-γ2 (PLCG2) to trigger several intracellular B cell activation pathways such as mobilization of the second messenger Ca2+ and nuclear translocation of the pivotal transcription factor NF-κB. Hence, SLP65 is the signal gatekeeper of B cell activation. Indeed, loss of SLP65 expression or its function severely compromises the development and function of B cells in mice and humans. More recently, we found that the signaling function of SLP65 relies on its interaction with intracellular vesicles to which it is attached by virtue of an N-terminal lipid binding moiety. A majority of these vesicles stained positive for vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) 7 and quinacrine, but there was no unique marker or combination of markers characterizing a particular cellular vesicle pool that specifically attracts SLP65 molecules. However, the vesicular compartmentalization of SLP65 appeared to be critical for the stimulation-independent (i.e. constitutive) association of SLP65 with CIN85. The association of SLP65 and CIN85 is caused by atypical SH3 domain docking motifs in SLP65 that associate in a promiscuous manner with the three N-terminal SH3 domains of CIN85. A C-terminal coiled coil domain of CIN85 forms stable CIN85 trimers that drive multimerization of SLP65. Functional studies showed that the formation of a permanent SLP65/CIN85 oligomeric complex in resting B cells is mandatory for proper B cell activation. In humans, the loss of CIN85 expression causes severe antibody deficiency caused by B cell-intrinsic signaling defects, highlighting the non-redundant function of CIN85 for BCR signal transduction. To elucidate how exactly the concerted interactions between SLP65, CIN85 and vesicles promote B cell activation, we used a combination of various methods to investigate the structure of these complexes and their functional signaling role in the live B cell. Here we show that all three components act in concert to drive a tripartite liquid-liquid phase separation process in vitro at physiological protein concentrations. In the live B cell, this results in the formation of intracellular signaling bodies or droplets that are reminiscent of other phase-separated organelles such as stress granules or RNA transport granules. RESULTS. TRIPARTITE PHASE SEPARATION AT PHYSIOLOGICAL CONCENTRATIONS. In accordance with previously published data, citrine-tagged wild-type SLP65 but not mutant versions of SLP65 lacking either the N-terminal lipid binding domain or the CIN85-interacting PRMs formed submicrometer granules in resting B cells (Fig. 1a). The subcellular localization patterns strictly correlated with the ability or disability of SLP65 to trigger mobilization of the second messenger Ca2+ on BCR ligation (Supplementary Fig. 1). Hence, the formation of granules through coordinated interactions of SLP65 with both vesicles and CIN85 appeared requisite for proper SLP65 signaling as suggested previously. Next, we investigated by confocal fluorescence microscopy, whether granule formation can be recapitulated in vitro using recombinantly expressed SLP65 and CIN85 and synthetic lipid vesicles in different combinations. We found that in the absence of vesicles, SLP65 undergoes phase separation when mixed with a monomeric CIN851-333 version lacking the trimerizing C-terminal coiled coil domain at and above 60 µM concentration of both proteins (Fig. 1b–c). The threshold concentration for phase separation was lowered to 10 µM when SLP65 was mixed with trimeric CIN85Δ57 (Fig. 1d). This CIN85 variant lacking 57 amino acids in the center of the protein was used because full-length CIN85 could not be recombinantly produced in sufficient quantities. However, we confirmed the functionality of the CIN85Δ57 version by reconstitution experiments of CIN85-deficient B cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results showed that SLP65 and CIN85 can undergo phase separation and that the phase separation boundary is controlled by their valency, which was mediated by three and nine SH3 domains of the monomeric and trimeric CIN85 forms, respectively. The promoting role of high valency for droplet formation is a common feature of phase-separating proteins. The SLP65/CIN85 droplets formed at and above 10 µM were about 10 µm in diameter, which is similar to or even larger than the diameter of the B cell itself. We therefore tested a possible contribution of vesicles and investigated whether the presence of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) in our in vitro approach would change the diameter of the droplets and/or lower the protein concentration needed for initiating the phase separation process. Indeed, addition of SUVs promoted droplet formation at 20 times lower protein concentrations, namely 0.5 μM (Fig. 1e). Importantly, this concentration was similar to the endogenous concentrations of SLP65 and CIN85 in DG75 and primary human B cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, phase separation of SLP65 and CIN85 occurs in vitro at protein concentrations found in vivo, but only in the presence of vesicles. This finding was confirmed further by the increased phase transition threshold of 10 µM for the N-terminal SLP65 deletion mutant, SLP65ΔN (Fig. 1f), which is unable to attach to vesicles and that does neither support granule formation nor BCR-activated Ca2+ mobilization when expressed in live B cells (see Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1).

32123037,"Ribosome Dimerization Protects the Small Subunit. When nutrients become scarce, bacteria can enter an extended state of quiescence. A major challenge of this state is how to preserve ribosomes for the return to favorable conditions. Here, we show that the ribosome dimerization protein hibernation-promoting factor (HPF) functions to protect essential ribosomal proteins. Ribosomes isolated from strains lacking HPF (Δhpf) or encoding a mutant allele of HPF that binds the ribosome but does not mediate dimerization were substantially depleted of the small subunit proteins S2 and S3. Strikingly, these proteins are located directly at the ribosome dimer interface. We used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to further characterize these ribosomes and observed that a high percentage of ribosomes were missing S2, S3, or both. These data support a model in which the ribosome dimerization activity of HPF evolved to protect labile proteins that are essential for ribosome function. HPF is almost universally conserved in bacteria, and HPF deletions in diverse species exhibit decreased viability during starvation. Our data provide mechanistic insight into this phenotype and establish a mechanism for how HPF protects ribosomes during quiescence.IMPORTANCE The formation of ribosome dimers during periods of dormancy is widespread among bacteria. Dimerization is typically mediated by a single protein, hibernation-promoting factor (HPF). Bacteria lacking HPF exhibit strong defects in viability and pathogenesis and, in some species, extreme loss of rRNA. The mechanistic basis of these phenotypes has not been determined. Here, we report that HPF from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis preserves ribosomes by preventing the loss of essential ribosomal proteins at the dimer interface. This protection may explain phenotypes associated with the loss of HPF, since ribosome protection would aid survival during nutrient limitation and impart a strong selective advantage when the bacterial cell rapidly reinitiates growth in the presence of sufficient nutrients.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,5397,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.9724148,1
32155444,"Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein. SUMMARY. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in >90,000 infections and >3,000 deaths. Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs. We determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination. INTRODUCTION. Three coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier to cause deadly pneumonia in humans since the beginning of the 21st century: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003), Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Zaki et al., 2012) (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 (Huang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV emerged in the Guangdong province of China in 2002 and spread to five continents through air travel routes, infecting 8,098 people and causing 774 deaths. In 2012, MERS-CoV emerged in the Arabian Peninsula, where it remains a major public health concern, and was exported to 27 countries, infecting a total of ~2,494 individuals and claiming 858 lives. A previously unknown coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province of China and was sequenced and isolated by January 2020 (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia (Covid-2019) that has affected over 90,000 people and killed more than 3,000 of those affected in >60 countries as of March 3, 2020. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern. MERS-CoV was suggested to originate from bats, but the reservoir host fueling spillover to humans is unequivocally dromedary camels (Haagmans et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2013). Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related and originated in bats, who most likely serve as reservoir host for these two viruses (Ge et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2005b; Yang et al., 2015a; Zhou et al., 2020). Whereas palm civets and racoon dogs have been recognized as intermediate hosts for zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV between bats and humans (Guan et al., 2003; Kan et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005), the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host remains unknown. The recurrent spillovers of coronaviruses in humans along with detection of numerous coronaviruses in bats, including many SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs), suggest that future zoonotic transmission events may continue (Anthony et al., 2017; Ge et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2005b; Menachery et al., 2015; Menachery et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2015a; Zhou et al., 2020). In addition to the highly pathogenic zoonotic pathogens SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, all belonging to the b-coronavirus genus, four low-pathogenicity coronaviruses are endemic in humans: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E. To date, no therapeutics or vaccines are approved against any human-infecting coronaviruses. Coronavirus entry into host cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein that forms homotrimers protruding from the viral surface (Tortorici and Veesler, 2019). S comprises two functional subunits responsible for binding to the host cell receptor (S1 subunit) and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (S2 subunit). For many CoVs, S is cleaved at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits, which remain non-covalently bound in the prefusion conformation (Belouzard et al., 2009; Bosch et al., 2003; Burkard et al., 2014; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Millet and Whittaker, 2014, 2015; Park et al., 2016; Walls et al., 2016a). The distal S1 subunit comprises the receptor-binding domain(s) and contributes to stabilization of the prefusion state of the membrane-anchored S2 subunit that contains the fusion machinery (Gui et al., 2017;Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Pallesen et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2016a; Walls et al., 2017b; Yuan et al., 2017). For all CoVs, S is further cleaved by host proteases at the so-called S2′ site located immediately upstream of the fusion peptide (Madu et al., 2009; Millet and Whittaker, 2015). This cleavage has been proposed to activate the protein for membrane fusion via extensive irreversible conformational changes (Belouzard et al., 2009; Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012; Millet and Whittaker, 2014, 2015; Park et al., 2016; Walls et al., 2017b). As a result, coronavirus entry into susceptible cells is a complex process that requires the concerted action of receptor-binding and proteolytic processing of the S protein to promote virus-cell fusion. Different coronaviruses use distinct domains within the S1 subunit to recognize a variety of attachment and entry receptors, depending on the viral species. Endemic human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 attach via their S domain A (SA) to 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl-sialosides found on glycoproteins and glycolipids at the host cell surface to enable entry into susceptible cells (Hulswit et al., 2019; Tortorici et al., 2019; Vlasak et al., 1988). MERS-CoV S, however, uses domain A to recognize non-acetylated sialoside attachment receptors (Li et al., 2017; Park et al., 2019), which likely promote subsequent binding of domain B (SB) to the entry receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4",PMC,pos,1,pos,5410,pos_PMC,0.99674594,1
32157086,"Structure of E3 ligase E6AP with a proteasome-binding site provided by substrate receptor hRpn10. INTRODUCTION. The 26S proteasome is a 2.5 MDa complex responsible for regulated protein degradation, with substrates typically ubiquitinated by a hierarchical enzymatic cascade. An E1 activating enzyme charges ubiquitin to become a protein modifier and transfers it to an E2 conjugating enzyme which, in concert with an E3 ligating enzyme, subsequently attaches ubiquitin to a substrate. Approximately 600 E3s exist in humans that can either accept the charged ubiquitin for direct transfer to a substrate or serve as a scaffold for ubiquitin transfer from the E2 to a substrate. Following ubiquitination, receptor sites in the proteasome contributed by Rpn1, Rpn10, and Rpn13 recognize ubiquitin directly or the ubiquitin fold of shuttle factor ubiquitin-like domains; shuttle factors bind ubiquitinated substrates by one or more ubiquitin-associated domain. At the proteasome, ubiquitin chains are hydrolyzed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) Rpn11, UCHL5/Uch37, and Usp14, as the marked substrate is translocated through an ATPase ring for entry into the hollow interior of the proteolytic core particle (CP). The integrity of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is essential for cellular homeostasis with dysfunction linked to disease, including cancer and neurodegeneration. Inhibitors of the CP are used to treat hematologic cancers and additional proteasome subunits are being pursued as synergistic targets, including hRpn13. Hijacking of ubiquitin E3 ligase E6AP/UBE3A by high risk human papilloma virus E6 oncoprotein contributes to cervical cancer by inducing ubiquitination and in turn degradation of tumor suppressor p53. Moreover, loss-of-function mutations in E6AP associate with Angelman syndrome and elevated gene dosage with autism spectrum disorders. How aberrant E6AP mechanistically contributes to these neurological diseases is an active area of investigation; however, E6AP was recently found to ubiquitinate calcium- and voltage-dependent potassium channels, the dysfunction and hyperexcitability of which is associated with Angelman syndrome. E6AP distributes in an isoform-dependent manner between the nucleus and cytosol of neurons and contains an N-terminal Zn-binding AZUL (amino-terminal zinc-binding domain of ubiquitin E3a ligase) domain that binds to Rpn10 in the proteasome, and is required for E6AP nuclear localization. An Angelman syndrome-associated missense mutation in the E6AP HECT domain interferes with E6AP nuclear localization, although the connection between this mutation and the requirement for the AZUL domain is not known. E6AP also stimulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a function that requires its ubiquitin ligase activity and interaction with the proteasome, and is disrupted by an autism-linked E6AP mutation. Although multiple E3 ligases have been reported to associate with the proteasome, no E3 ligase-proteasome complex structure is available, nor has any domain been identified for recruiting an E3 ligase to the proteasome. Here, we identify a region at the C-terminal end of hRpn10 that forms a binding site in the proteasome for E6AP. By using biophysical techniques including NMR spectroscopy, we find this region to be disordered when unbound, but upon binding to E6AP, to fold into an independent structural domain characterized by two helices that pack against the E6AP AZUL to form a 4-helix bundle. To test the significance of the E6AP-binding domain, we used gene editing to generate cell lines in which it is deleted and find that this hRpn10 domain contributes E6AP to the proteasome. We unexpectedly find that hRpn10 levels are coupled to E6AP cellular protein levels. Altogether, our data suggest a dual regulatory role for hRpn10 in E6AP function and that through hRpn10, E6AP is a privileged ubiquitin E3 ligase for the proteasome. RESULTS. HUMAN RPN10 CONTAINS A C-TERMINAL DOMAIN THAT BINDS E6AP. Rpn10 has an N-terminal von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain that assembles into the proteasome and a UIM region for binding ubiquitinated proteins; these domains complete the protein in fungi (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In higher eukaryotes, Rpn10 contains an additional conserved ~70 amino acids at the C-terminus (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). We recorded a 2D NMR experiment on 15N-hRpn10 spanning 196–377, which encompasses the UIM region and uncharacterized C-terminal end. The resulting spectrum indicated that the UIM region, readily identified by our previous assignment of these amino acids, is unperturbed by the additional C-terminal sequence (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Ubiquitin addition to 15N-hRpn10196–377 demonstrated expected shifting of the UIMs but no effect for the unassigned signals (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Thus, the additional sequence does not interact with the UIM region, nor does it bind ubiquitin. To identify proteins that interact directly or in complex with the C-terminal hRpn10 domain, we subcloned the region spanning 305–377 in frame with GST, expressed and purified the fusion protein from Escherichia coli, and bound purified GST-hRpn10305–377 to glutathione sepharose resin for incubation with lysates from 293T (human embryonic kidney epithelial) or HCT116 (colorectal carcinoma) cells. After washing, resin-bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, eluted from the gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry; parallel experiments were done with GST protein as a control. The only hit identified for either 293T or HCT116 lysate was E6AP (Supplementary Fig. 2a). The human UBE3A gene encodes three isoforms generated by differential splicing that vary at the extreme N-terminus (Supplementary Fig. 2b). To test whether E6AP binds to the hRpn10 C-terminal region directly, we incubated full-length E6AP (Isoform II) with Ni-NTA resin pre-bound to His-hRpn10full-length, His-hRpn10196–377, or His-hRpn10196–306. hRpn10full-length and hRpn10196–377 bound E6AP, whereas hRpn10196–306 did not (Fig. 1b).

32184239,"Structural Basis of Ca2+-Dependent Self-Processing Activity of Repeat-in-Toxin Proteins. INTRODUCTION. The Ca2+-dependent “clip-and-link” activity represents a distinct type of posttranslational autoprocessing of proteins. It consists of Ca2+-induced autocatalytic cleavage of a specific Asp-Pro peptide bond within a polypeptide precursor that generates a reactive C-terminal Asp anhydride, which can then react with an ε-amino group of an adjacent lysine residue to form a new covalent isopeptide bond (1). This process is mediated by a self-processing module (SPM), a 177-residue-long polypeptide domain that is exclusively present in a specific subset of repeat-in-toxin (RTX) proteins of Gram-negative bacteria (2). These very large proteins (>1,000 residues) are secreted by a dedicated type I secretion system (T1SS) that recognizes a C-terminal noncleavable secretion signal preceded by a variable number of tandem repeats of a consensus motif GGXGXDXXX (3). These RTX repeats form a calcium-binding parallel β-roll structure that folds vectorially, from the C to N terminus in the course of secretion, as the RTX substrates exit from the calcium-depleted bacterial cytosol into the calcium-rich extracellular milieu (4, 5). Even though many RTX proteins serve as major virulence factors of Gram-negative pathogens, the RTX proteins carrying the SPM domain were not found to exert any cytotoxic activity on host cells. Possibly, the Ca2+-dependent clip-and-link activity of FrpC, an iron-regulated RTX protein of Neisseria meningitidis, might be involved in the interaction of the bacterium with the host cell surface (6). Recent biochemical and biophysical characterization of the SPM domain of FrpC revealed that the Ca2+-dependent clip-and-link activity results from the Ca2+-induced folding of the SPM polypeptide (2). Three EF-hand-like Ca2+-binding loops were predicted to be a key feature of an SPM structure, which appears to be stabilized by a noncovalent π-π interaction between two tryptophan residues (W451 and W519) arranged in a T-shaped orientation. Its formation involves a cooperative structural transition from an unfolded conformation to a well-folded state that enables a highly specific processing of the peptide bond between the Asp414 residue and the N-terminal Pro415 residue of the SPM amino acid sequence (residues 415 to 591 of FrpC). As a result, the D414-P415 bond breaks, and a reactive anhydride is formed at the newly released D414 residue, which upon nucleophilic attack by an ε-amino group of an adjacent polypeptide chain can form a new covalent isopeptide bond (Fig. 1A). Since the cross-linking activity of SPM can be inhibited by nucleophile scavengers, such as the reducing agents with a free thiol group (e.g., 1,4-dithiothreitol), the self-processing activity of SPM could be used for development of a self-excising affinity tag that allows purification of untagged recombinant proteins in a single chromatographic step (7). However, the structural and mechanistic aspects of the Ca2+-dependent clip-and-link activity of large RTX proteins remained unknown. Here, we determined the solution structure of the calcium-loaded SPM (Ca-SPM) domain derived from the FrpC protein of Neisseria meningitidis and propose the mechanism of Ca2+-dependent autocatalytic processing of the D414-P415 peptide bond. We further show that abrogation of the Ca2+-dependent clip-and-link activity of ApxIVA, an exclusively in vivo-expressed RTX protein of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, results in attenuation of the virulence of the pathogen in experimental lung infection in pigs. This is the first demonstration that the Ca2+-dependent clip-and-link activity of large RTX proteins plays a role in the virulence of Gram-negative pathogens. RESULTS. FIG S1. NMR STRUCTURE OF CA-SPM. To gain insight into the catalytic mechanism of Asp-Pro bond processing, we determined the solution structure of calcium-loaded SPM (Ca-SPM) by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1B, the 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of Ca-SPM exhibited the broad dispersion of backbone amide cross-peaks typical for structured proteins. The spectrum did not contain residual peaks typical for the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the Ca2+-depleted SPM (Fig. 1B, black contours), thus documenting that the Ca-SPM preparation was free of residual unfolded protein. Conventional triple resonance and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) NMR spectra provided structural information for the whole protein, except of a region of 21 residues between T430 and G450. These residues were affected by conformational or chemical exchange and likely formed a loop lacking a unique structure. Moreover, deletion of the loop consisting of residues T430 to G450 did not affect the cleavage capacity of the respective glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SPM fusion protein, indicating that the loop does not contribute to structuring and autocatalytic activity of SPM (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The overlay of 20 low-energy structures based on the 3,412 NOE and 234 dihedral angle restraints is displayed in Fig. 1C. The Ca-SPM structure has a compact fold composed of eight anti-parallel β-strands connected by a single helix-turn-helix motif and several surface-exposed turns and loops (Fig. 1D). These structures appear to be stabilized by calcium ions as the overall structure of Ca-SPM is well defined with a backbone root square mean deviation (RMSD) of 0.70 ± 0.16 Å (Table 1). However, the most abundant calcium isotope, 42Ca, is not observable by NMR, and the number and exact position of calcium ion(s) could not be identified by this NMR approach. 10.1128/mBio.00226-20.1. The T430-G450 residues are not involved in the cleavage activity of SPM.

32219396,"Making Sense of Computational Psychiatry. INTRODUCTION. Psychiatry frequently refers to models. At its very basis, a model is a heuristic, a way to make sense of a complex set of interactions and relationships by virtue of a simple rule. Psychiatry’s earliest models attempted to explain the psyche, and therefore deviations from its norms, using heuristics based on psychoanalytic theories on the influence of, often unconscious, childhood experiences and defense mechanisms (Figure 1A). These conceptual models persist today (e.g., the ""attachment parenting"" model identifies various behavioral pathologies emerging later in life as the consequence of inadequate parental responsiveness during a child’s early years (Benoit, 2004). However, as psychiatry has embraced rapid gains made possible by noninvasive neuroimaging, most current psychiatric models now explicitly incorporate information about the brain, with corresponding interest in “circuits.” These tend to integrate neural and psychological frameworks; for example, by describing “regulation” within region-of-interest–scale systems schematically described by arrows connecting boxes representing regions associated with different psychologically defined functions (e.g., “fear,” “craving,” and “willpower”). In contrast, the term “circuit” in basic neuroscience is typically used to refer to microcircuits in which biophysical processes, such as changing resting membrane potentials, modulate signal response. As with recent elegant work on thalamocortical adaptive sensory gating (Mease et al., 2014; Manita et al., 2015), these can take the form of complex control processes, which are normally derived from rodent electrophysiology, using optogenetic and/or chemogenetic manipulations. While some clinical neuroscience models (Figure 1B) are also dynamical systems as defined by control systems engineering (Figure 1C) (i.e., they describe systems as a whole that can predict trajectories over time), the more typical use of the term ""circuit,"" as currently used within the clinical neuroscience literature, reflects co-activation between regions, defined by correlations. These co-activated structures are actually more appropriately described as ""networks"" than circuits, a distinction that contributes to the conceptual divide between clinical neuroscience, basic neuroscience, and their computational extensions. The integration of human neuroimaging with computational neuroscience is comparatively recent, with the field today broadly consisting of 3 approaches that all fall within the description of dynamical systems. The first are bottom-up biophysical approaches that start with neurons and then extrapolate to aggregates and their mean field dynamics, for example, Magneto/electroencephalography (M/EEG) oscillations (Schurmann et al., 2007; Murray et al., 2018). The second are top-down approaches, which start from emergent phenomena and try to infer a set of neural mechanisms that could lead to such phenomena (Deco et al., 2011; Radulescu and Mujica-Parodi, 2014; Breakspear, 2017; Pillai and Jirsa, 2017). The third, information-theoretic, approach investigates structural strategies by which the brain might optimize for efficiency in information propagation based on considerations from graph theory/network science (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Bassett et al., 2010; Gu et al., 2015). Excellent reviews can be found in the cited references for each of the above topics. Therefore, our scope here will be more general and attempt to address 2 fundamental questions. First, how does mainstream neuropsychiatry differ in its models as compared with more mature fields like physics, the latter of which are closer to control/dynamical systems as employed by computational psychiatry? Second, what follows from these differences? In so doing, we hope to “make sense” of computational psychiatry and why we believe it offers the potential for transformative advances for the neuropsychiatric field, both scientific and clinical. THE DANGER OF CATEGORY ERRORS. Psychiatric/psychological models have historically distinguished themselves from those in neuroscience by their focus on narrative (e.g., the “schizophrenogenic mother” model, in which early maternal rejection causes her child’s later psychotic paranoia) (Morris, 2012). At its best, this narrative approach has allowed psychiatry to move beyond mere taxonomies of signs and symptoms to approach the mind in a manner that aims to be mechanistic and causal. At its worst, it risks providing a satisfyingly intuitive, yet ultimately hollow, “just so” story with no manner of objectively confirming or disconfirming the correctness of its conceptual frameworks. Unfortunately, the effects associated with unconfirmed conceptual frameworks are not localized to the specific interpretation of results that promote them but can be more generally pernicious if they inform the generation and interpretation of new data. To the degree to which a field permits untested models to propagate, it risks following false leads that can take generations of experiments to correct. One recent example is the psychology field’s model of oxytocin—a neuropeptide endogenously produced during female labor and lactation. The conceptual model of oxytocin as a “trust drug” was based on the assumption that hormonal influences on maternal bonding might extend to blind induction of “trust.” Behavioral responses (greater generosity in the face of nonreciprocal feedback) (Kosfeld et al., 2005) and neurobiological responses (weaker amygdala activation) (Baumgartner et al., 2008) to exogenous administration of oxytocin when patients played several variations of a neuroeconomic game, as well as subsequent neuroimaging experiments of fear (Kirsch et al., 2005), conditioned fear (Petrovic et al., 2008), and fearful faces (Domes et al., 2007; Gamer et al., 2010), seemed initially to support this model. However, after these results were embraced by the media and the clinical community, which went so far as to propose cl",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,5426,far_neg_PMC,0.003004343,0

The trimeric transmembrane collagen BP180, also known as collagen XVII, is an essential component of hemidesmosomes at the dermal-epidermal junction and connects the cytoplasmic keratin network to the extracellular basement membrane. Dysfunction of BP180 caused by mutations in patients with junctional epidermolysis bullosa or autoantibodies in those with bullous pemphigoid leads to severe skin blistering. The extracellular collagenous domain of BP180 participates in the protein's triple-helical folding, but the structure and functional importance of the intracellular domain (ICD) of BP180 are largely unknown. In the present study, we purified and characterized human BP180 ICD. When expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione-S-transferase or 6 × histidine tagged fusion protein, the BP180 ICD was found to exist as a monomer. Analysis of the secondary structure content by circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the domain is intrinsically disordered. This finding aligned with that of a bioinformatic analysis, which predicted a disordered structure. Interestingly, both anionic detergent micelles and lipid vesicles induced partial folding of the BP180 ICD, suggesting that in its natural environment, the domain's folding and unfolding may be regulated by interaction with the cell membrane or accompanying proteins.

The aim of the study was to investigate changes in gut microbiota upon feeding predigested Hb, AF, OF or Mix (Hb/AF) to a dynamic, validated in vitro model of the human colon (TIM-2), using sequencing of the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. A pooled human fecal microbiota was used. Production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), branched-chain fatty acids (BSCFAs) and ammonia was also assessed. Samples were taken after 0, 24, 48 and 72 h. Principal component (PC) analysis of fermentation metabolites and relative abundance of genera was carried out, and extracted factors were based on eigenvalues >1.0 and explained >60% of variance. Fermentation of samples resulted in different SCFAS concentrations. The highest butyric acid production was on AF and OF, while the molar ratio of SCFAS on Hb was 63:18:18 for acetic, propionic and butyric acid, respectively. BSCFAS were also produced upon feeding the studied substrates, but in much lower concentrations. About 45 bacteria genera were identified and 10 of these were the most abundant changing during the fermentation time, amongst which a high relative abundance in Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides and Catenibacterium, that changed during the fermentation time depending of substrate.

32357182,"A conformation-based intra-molecular initiation factor identified in the flavivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. INTRODUCTION. The flaviviruses are a large group of positive-strand RNA viruses, including dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV). The majority of flaviviruses are mosquito-borne or tick-borne, sometimes causing human encephalitis or hemorrhagic diseases. The recent ZIKV outbreaks in South and North America, and more recently in Southeast Asia, have intensified the global threats of flaviviruses, in part due to the capabilities of the virus to cause birth defects through maternal-fetal transmission [1]. The flavivirus RNA genome is 10–11 kilo-bases in length, bearing a type 1 cap and lacking a poly-adenine tail. It encodes a large polyprotein that is further processed by viral and host proteases, yielding three structural proteins C/prM/E, and seven nonstructural proteins NS1/NS2A/NS2B/NS3/NS4A/NS4B/NS5 [2]. Being a unique natural fusion of an N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) and a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), the NS5 is the largest and most conserved protein encoded by flaviviruses. The NS5 MTase catalyzes the guanylyltransfer and both the guanine N7 and nucleoside 2′-O methylation steps in the capping process, and is a single-domain module adopting a common S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent MTase fold [3,4]. The K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad sits in the center of the MTase catalytic cleft, with the methyl donor SAM binding site and the cap binding site residing on the opposite sides. The RdRP module is the central molecular machine governing the viral genome replication, and has an encircled human right hand architecture with palm, fingers, and thumb domains surrounding the active site [5,6]. The fingers domain can be further divided into index, middle, ring, and pinky subdomains according to nomenclatures first used in describing the poliovirus (PV) RdRP (Fig 1A) [7,8]. Among the seven viral RdRP catalytic motifs, A/B/C/D/E are within the most conserved palm, and F/G are part of the ring and pinky fingers, respectively. Motifs A/B/C/F contain amino acids highly conserved in all viral RdRPs, and these conserved residues have highly analogous spatial arrangements around the polymerase active site [9,10]. Being an entity bearing two active sites and multiple essential viral enzymatic activities, NS5 has become a very attractive system in flavivirus research, and understanding the interplay between its MTase and RdRP modules is undoubtedly critical. Among the evidence related to MTase-RdRP crosstalk, high-resolution structures of full-length NS5 are essential in providing direct and informative readout of the interactions between the two modules. To date, two types of global conformations have been observed in full-length NS5 structures [11]. The conformation revealed by the JEV NS5 structure (named JEV-mode hereinafter) features a medium size interface (~1540 Å2, for all interface area values presented in this study, the total buried solvent accessible surface from both side of the interface was accounted) with a conserved hydrophobic core [8,12], and is also observed in recently reported ZIKV, yellow fever virus (YFV), and DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) full-length NS5 crystal structures [13–18]. In such a conformation, the MTase approaches the RdRP from its backside and interacts with the RdRP middle finger, ring finger, and an index finger helix bearing part of a nuclear localization signal (NLS-helix) [19] (Fig 1A). The second conformation was observed in two different crystal forms of DENV serotype 3 (DENV3) NS5 (named DENV3-mode hereinafter) [20,21] (Fig 1B). In this case, the MTase also approaches the RdRP from the backside, but it is related to the JEV conformation by an approximately 110° rotation around an axis passing near its center of mass with less than 6 Å translation. The RdRP index and middle fingers are still involved in the interactions in a slightly larger interface (~1650–1780 Å2), and the nature of the interactions is instead primarily polar. Notably, the NTP binding ring finger (motif F) contacts with the MTase are absent in the DENV3 structures and the ring finger itself and the adjacent motif G residues in the pinky finger are largely disordered (Fig 1B). Motif G participates in RNA template binding and has been proposed to participate in the translocation step after every phosphoryl transfer reaction [22,23]. Hence, the JEV-mode conformation likely represents a state more suitable for polymerase synthesis from the structural perspective. With two monomer conformation modes and eight crystal forms identified, more than 10 NS5 dimer interfaces can be recognized in the aforementioned NS5 crystal structures with no obvious conservative features. A couple of studies did focus on some of these dimer interface interactions, even though the primary NS5 solution state is monomer [16,21]. Either by probing the inter-molecular interactions, deleting the MTase domain, or mutating the MTase-RdRP linker, multiple in vitro polymerase assay-based studies together suggest that the MTase regulates the RdRP catalytic activities, albeit to overall moderate extents [12,14,16,18,24,25]. However, the RdRP assays established in all these studies, no matter in primer-dependent or de novo (including dinucleotide driven) format, did not demonstrate the formation of a processive RdRP elongation complex (EC), at least for the majority of the polymerase molecules, and all these assays require the manganese ion (Mn2+) for catalysis, albeit in combination with the magnesium ion (Mg2+) in some cases. In other words, the mutation-derived effect on RdRP synthesis observed in these studies may only reflect overall changes in non-processive RdRP synthesis activity, while specific alteration of either RdRP initiation or elongation cannot be clearly judged. Furthermore, none of these studies characterized both the JEV- and DENV3-mode monomer conform",PMC,pos,1,pos,5459,pos_PMC,0.9965771,1
32374734,"Survivorship and growth in staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) outplanting projects in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. INTRODUCTION. The tropical western Atlantic reef-building coral Acropora cervicornis was abundant and widespread throughout the Caribbean and Florida until the late 1970s [1]. The fast-growing coral formed dense thickets in forereef, backreef, and patch-reef environments to depths over 20 m [2–6] since the late Pleistocene [7, 8]. However, A. cervicornis abundance is now significantly reduced throughout its geographical range, primarily as a result of coral disease [1, 9, 10], bleaching [11–13], and other disturbances that affect sites at regional and local scales [14–16]. Today, A. cervicornis populations in Florida consist mostly of small (< 50 cm maximum diameter) and scattered colonies [17–19]. The dramatic decline in populations resulted in the loss of habitat complexity [20, 21], biological diversity [22], and the aesthetic quality of reef habitats. In the Caribbean, only a few populations survive that resemble the thickets of the past; these are in Honduras [23], the Dominican Republic [24, 25], and Belize [26, 27]. None persist in the Florida Keys, though a few nearshore aggregations exist north of Miami [28, 29] and in the Dry Tortugas [30]. Recovery has not occurred in Florida because stressors persist [31], including disease [9, 10], bleaching [14, 32], and episodic and severe cold-water events [33–38]. The mass mortality of the abundant grazing sea urchin Diadema antillarum in the early 1980s [39] also reshaped the ecology of coral reefs by releasing macroalgae from grazing [40]. There has since been a limited recovery of this herbivore in Florida [41, 42]. The dramatic decline in abundance and the absence of recovery of A. cervicornis and its congener A. palmata resulted in their listing as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List [43]. The corals are also listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act [44]. After the species were listed as Threatened in 2006 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) developed a Recovery Plan for the two species [6]. The NOAA Recovery Plan (NRP) aims for population viability through increased population numbers and mitigation of stressors. Recovery criteria for the species include population metrics such as abundance, colony size, genetic diversity, and recruitment, that when met, along with the reduction of stressor impacts, would result in their delisting from the Endangered Species Act. The NRP identified coral outplanting of nursery-raised colonies to offshore reefs as a strategy to increase population numbers. The approach was based, in part, on a long history of projects that reattached corals dislodged by storms or by ship groundings [45–49], as well as outplanting advancements adapted from terrestrial silviculture practices and the aquarium trade [50–54]. These outplanting projects removed small pieces of coral from natural populations and propagated them by fragmentation to produce thousands of derivative colonies [55–58]. The colonies were subsequently outplanted in bulk to offshore coral reefs, where they were typically attached to the bottom using underwater cement or epoxy [55, 59, 60]. Colony numbers in individual nurseries quickly expanded from yearly production totals of hundreds to many thousands of colonies. As a result, restoration work advanced from restoring sites damaged by ship-groundings to projects that supplemented natural recruitment and enhanced existing populations [60–65]. While coral outplanting is considered a viable strategy to help meet the restoration criteria outlined in the NRP, coral propagation and outplanting are still a relatively new idea [66]. Though the practice is expanding rapidly and is now widely adopted by managers and restoration practitioners [67], few projects have been running long enough to assess their long-term potential to restore coral populations [48, 68–71]. An objective of the work reported here, based on results from longer-term A. cervicornis outplanting projects, is to determine the best approach to address and eventually overcome population declines. Results also inform the feasibility of success criteria identified in the NRP and help show how outplanted populations compare to baseline populations from the 1970s. Photographs and in situ field measurements documented how outplanting dates, site locations, habitat types, and genotypes relate to the survivorship, growth, and condition of nursery-raised A. cervicornis colonies outplanted to offshore reefs. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The Coral Restoration Foundation™ (CRF) cultivated the A. cervicornis colonies used in this study in their coral nursery located 5 km offshore in the upper Florida Keys, over a sandy bottom, and at a depth of approximately 9 m (Fig 1). Coral fragments within the nursery were either fixed on disks or suspended from lines or tree structures [72, 73]. Colonies grew to approximately 15 cm maximum diameter before outplanting to reefs by CRF staff or by trained volunteers [55]. In 2013 larger colonies were also outplanted to Pickles (32 of 296), French (3 of 161) and Conch Reefs (1 of 92) that were approximately 30 cm maximum diameter, with a few larger than 40 cm. Twenty projects (Table 1), each defined by a cohort of colonies outplanted at the same time and location, were started between 2007 and 2013 at six different reefs in three benthic habitat types (Fig 1), including spur-and groove, patch-reef, and hardbottom [74]. The number of outplants per project ranged from 18 to 400, including three to 16 genotypes, increasing over time as nursery capacity increased and permits allowed. CRF maintains records-of-lineage for genotypes (identified by microsatellites and haplotype sequences of mt DNA) and colonies produced each year in the nursery. Outplanted colonies were attached to the reef with epoxy in three different configurations. Space between outplanted coral colonies allowed growth for one or two years before adjacent corals might touch [75].

32483338,"Mechanism of ligand activation of a eukaryotic cyclic nucleotide-gated channel. Cyclic nucleotide-modulated ion channels are present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and play important physiological functions . In eukaryotes, they are grouped into cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels. CNG channels are essential for smell and vision in vertebrates. In olfactory receptors and photoreceptors, CNG channels open and close (i.e., gate) in response to stimuli-induced changes in the intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), thereby transducing biochemical signals into electrical and calcium signals . CNG channels are also expressed in the central nervous system where they modulate neuronal and glial functions . Numerous hereditary mutations in CNG channel genes have been associated with degenerative visual disorders such as retinitis and achromatopsia, for which new treatment strategies are being explored . CNG channels are nonselective cation channels . They are formed by four subunits, each containing six transmembrane (TM) segments (S1-S6) and a pore-loop between S5 and S6 . Although CNG channels belong to the voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) superfamily and have an S4 decorated with multiple positively charged amino acids , they are not activated by TM voltage owing to the unique structure of S4 and its interactions with other regions . CNG channels are activated by intracellular cAMP or cGMP, which bind to a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) in the intracellular C-terminus . A ~80-amino acid linker (called the C-linker) connecting the CNBD and S6 is crucial for ligand activation . Functional studies suggest that CNG channels have a single activation gate located in the ion selectivity filter (SF) , a view that has been widely accepted but has also been challenged . Despite extensive functional and structural studies, the way cyclic nucleotides (CN) activate CNG channels and whether the SF is in fact the activation gate remains largely unclear. This paucity of knowledge is due in part to a lack of structures of a full-length CNG channel in both the unliganded closed-state and liganded open-state. Work on prokaryotic CN-modulated channels such as MloK1, LliK and SthK has produced only closed-state structures, even in cases where a CN is bound to the CNBD . We recently reported a liganded open-state cryo-EM structure of a eukaryotic CNG channel TAX-4 , a cGMP-activated channel in Caenorhabditis elegans . In this study we determined single-particle cryo-EM structures of full-length TAX-4 reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs in a cGMP-unbound closed state and a cGMP-bound open state at 2.6 Å and 2.7 Å resolutions, respectively. We also carried out computational analyses and structure-guided mutagenesis to elucidate the ion permeation pathway. Our work reveals a single double-barrier hydrophobic gate in the central cavity and a conformational trajectory from the CNBD to the cavity gate in association with channel gating. RESULTS. CGMP-UNBOUND AND CGMP-BOUND STRUCTURES. To obtain a cGMP-unbound structure, full-length TAX-4 was purified in the presence of 100 μM cGMP as previously described , but cGMP was omitted in the final gel filtration elution buffer. The purified apo protein formed cGMP-activated channels when reconstituted in liposomes (Fig. 1a). For single-particle cryo-EM analysis, the protein was reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs (Extended Data Fig. 1). A cryo-EM density map of unliganded TAX-4 tetramer was obtained at an overall resolution of 2.6 Å and 2.8 Å with imposed C4 and C1 symmetry, respectively (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2, and Table 1). The local resolution varies from 2.4 Å in some TM and cytoplasmic regions to 3.0 Å in the peripheries of the 3D reconstruction with C4 symmetry (Extended Data Fig. 1h). The densities were of excellent quality for most functional regions (Extended Data Fig. 2). We were able to model 513 of the 733 amino acids of TAX-4 in the final structure (Table 1). Residues M1 to V103 (N-terminus), G162 to L164, and D620 to K733 (distal C-terminus) were not modeled because of weak or missing densities. The previous cGMP-bound open-state TAX-4 structure was obtained in amphipol . To ensure adequate comparison with the cGMP-unbound structure, we determined the cryo-EM structure of cGMP-bound TAX-4 in lipid nanodiscs (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Table 1). The overall resolution reached 2.7 Å and 2.9 Å with imposed C4 and C1 symmetry, respectively, which is significantly higher than the 3.5 Å-resolution in amphipol. The cGMP-bound structures in nanodiscs and amphipol are highly similar, with an α-carbon r.m.s.d of 0.9 Å when all of the 512 resolved amino acids are superimposed. The overall architecture of cGMP-unbound TAX-4 is similar to that of cGMP-bound TAX-4 (Fig. 1c,d). The channel is a tetramer and has a non-domain swapped configuration (Fig. 1c). As described previously , each protomer can be arbitrarily divided into four structural layers along the fourfold axis: an extracellular domain comprising mainly of the S1-S2 linker, a transmembrane domain (TMD) comprising of S1-S6 and the pore-loop, a gating ring formed by helices A’B’C’D’ of the C-linker, which also contains helices E’F’, and the CNBD (Fig. 1d). As the primary goal of this work is to determine cGMP-induced conformational changes in the full-length channel, and since it is unknown a priori which regions of TAX-4 remain static during cGMP activation, we opted to superimpose the cGMP-unbound and -bound structures based on an alignment of all resolved atoms (see METHODS for details). The global and local structural comparisons described below are all based on this alignment. Global comparison reveals marked conformational changes in many parts of the channel (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Video 1), as detailed below. The α-carbon and all-atom r.m.s.d of global superposition is 2.6 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively. The entire channel contract",PMC,pos,1,pos,5481,pos_PMC,0.99653685,1
32526208,"Structural Basis for RNA Replication by the SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase. INTRODUCTION. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease that has led to more than three million cases and a pandemic is caused by a novel virus strain, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae (Zhu et al., 2020). Previously known coronaviruses (CoVs) that infect humans, e.g., hCoV-OC43, HKU1, and 229E, usually cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses (Corman et al., 2018). However, over the past two decades, highly pathogenic human coronaviruses have emerged (de Wit et al., 2016), including SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the current SARS-CoV-2. Infection with these highly pathogenic coronaviruses can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which might lead to a long-term reduction in lung function, arrhythmia, and death (Graham et al., 2013, Huang et al., 2020). Distinct from MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread more efficiently (Petrosillo et al., 2020). Unfortunately, there are currently no highly effective drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, or MERS-CoV. One of the most promising druggable targets for coronaviruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of RNA viruses. In coronaviruses, it supports the transcription and replication of their ∼30,000-nucleotide large RNA genomes. RdRP is targeted in different RNA viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and CoVs (Mercorelli et al., 2018). Compared to several other different positive-sense RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 polymerase displays structural similarity with several key amino acid residues conserved in the active site (Gao et al., 2020). This similarity makes drug repurposing an effective strategy that could shorten the drug development time compared to that of de novo drug discovery. Nucleotide and nucleoside analogs that inhibit polymerases are an important group of antiviral agents (Debing et al., 2015). Clinical trials are in progress for the treatment of COVID-19 by using the RdRP nucleotide inhibitors, such as remdesivir (RDV) and favipiravir. A substantial obstacle for the discovery, optimization, and comprehensive evaluation of effective nucleotide-based drugs for the SARS-CoV-2 is the lack of molecular detail concerning substrate recognition during replication. To gain insight into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication and its inhibition by nucleotide analog inhibitors, we have determined near-atomic-resolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase-RNA complex in its catalytic states, including a remdesivir monophosphate (RDV-MP) incorporated pre-translocated complex and a stalled post-translocated complex. RESULTS. ASSEMBLY AND PURIFICATION OF RNA POLYMERASE CATALYTIC COMPLEXES. The structure of the RdRP from SARS-CoV-2 bound to non-structural protein 7 (nsp7) and nsp8 co-factors was previously determined in the absence of RNA, providing a view of the overall architecture of the RdRP complex assembly (Gao et al., 2020). However, the mechanism as to how RdRP recognizes and synthesizes RNA remains unsolved. To address this key issue, we have screened more than ten nucleic acid substrates (Table S1) for their polymerase activity in a primer-dependent RdRP assay (Figures 1 and S1 C). On the basis of the assessment of primer utilization efficiency and product homogeneity, we chose an RNA construct with a 33-mer template (T33-1) and a 10-mer primer (P10) for catalytic complex assembly and subsequent structural study. To obtain the catalytic complex, we mixed purified nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8 (Figures S1A and S1B) with the T33-1:P10 construct (Figure 1A). Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were supplied as the only nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrates to allow the incorporation of a C-A-C-A tetranucleotide, resulting in an RdRP catalytic complex containing a 14-mer product (P14) (Figure 1A). This complex represents a post-translocated state after four NMP incorporation events, therefore representing the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP-RNA catalytic complex in action. To investigate the mechanism of RDV-TP (remdesivir triphosphate) inhibition, we designed another 33-mer template (T33-7) and successfully obtained an RDV-MP-incorporated catalytic complex in the pre-translocated state (Figure 1B). Briefly, the identical C-A-C-A tetranucleotide was incorporated by the RdRP to form the P14-containing complex. After purification by anion exchange chromatography, the P14-containing complex sample was incubated with guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) and RDV-TP at 4°C for 30 min before being frozen for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data collection. The final structure showed a G-G-R-G tetranucleotide was further incorporated into the product RNA chain (corresponding to an 18-mer product or P18) (Figures 1B, S1D, and S1E). The cryo-EM map signal on the 1′-cyano (1′-CN) group of the −1 nucleotide, the guanine base of the +1 nucleotide in the product strand are unambiguous to ensure the assignment of this pre-translocated P18-containing catalytic complex in which the incorporated RDV-MP (R) has been translocated to the −1 position, whereas the 3′-guanosine occupies the +1 position (see below for details). STRUCTURE ARCHITECTURE OF THE CATALYTIC COMPLEX. Cryo-EM single-particle analysis results in two near-atomic-resolution structures of the polymerase catalytic complexes, the complex in a pre-translocated state at 2.93 Å (Figure S2 ) and that in a post-translocated state at 3.26 Å (Figure S3 ). The complexes in the two states share similar structure architecture. They both comprise the viral proteins nsp12, nsp8, and nsp7, and RNA template-product duplex that lies in the active site cleft of nsp12 (Figures 2A and 2B). The most notable difference is that, in the pre-translocated complex with a longer P18 product",PMC,pos,1,pos,5487,pos_PMC,0.9933072,1
32548171,"Gastric pyloric gland adenoma resembling a submucosal tumor: A case report. BACKGROUND Pyloric gland adenoma (PGA) is a recently described and rare tumor. Submucosal tumor (SMT)-like PGA is more difficult to diagnose and differentiate from other submucosal lesions. CASE SUMMARY We present the case of a 69-year-old man with a 10 mm SMT-like elevated lesion with an opening in the upper part of the gastric body, referred to our hospital for further endoscopic treatment. Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging, endoscopic ultrasonography, and complete endoscopic submucosal dissection were performed on the patient. Histopathological findings revealed tightly packed tubular glands lined with cuboidal or columnar cells that had round-to-oval nuclei containing occasional prominent nucleoli and an eosinophilic cytoplasm similar to that in non-neoplastic gastric pyloric glands. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining for both mucin 5AC and mucin 6. Therefore, we arrived at the final diagnosis of gastric PGA. Although there was no apparent malignant component in this tumor, PGA has been considered a precancerous disease with a high risk of transformation into adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION PGA should be considered when detecting gastric SMT-like lesions. Physicians and pathologists should focus on PGA due to its malignant potential.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,5491,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0036499873,0

OBJECTIVES To examine trends in survival without major morbidity and its individual components among very low birth weight infants across California and assess remaining gaps that may be opportune targets for improvement efforts. METHODS The study population included infants born between 2008 and 2017 with birth weights of 401 to 1500 g or a gestational age of 22 to 29 weeks. Risk-adjusted trends of survival without major morbidity and its individual components were analyzed. Survival without major morbidity was defined as the absence of death during birth hospitalization, chronic lung disease, severe peri-intraventricular hemorrhage, nosocomial infection, necrotizing enterocolitis, severe retinopathy of prematurity or related surgery, and cystic periventricular leukomalacia. Variations in adjusted rates and/or interquartile ranges were examined. To assess opportunities for additional improvement, all hospitals were reassigned to perform as if in the top quartile, and recalculation of predicted numbers were used to estimate potential benefit. RESULTS In this cohort of 49 333 infants across 142 hospitals, survival without major morbidity consistently increased from 62.2% to 66.9% from 2008 to 2017. Network variation decreased, with interquartile ranges decreasing from 21.1% to 19.2%. The largest improvements were seen for necrotizing enterocolitis and nosocomial infection. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates did not change significantly. Over the final 3 years, if all hospitals performed as well as the top quartile, an additional 621 infants per year would have survived without major morbidity, accounting for an additional 6.6% annual improvement. CONCLUSIONS Although trends are promising, bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains a common and persistent major morbidity, remaining a target for continued quality-improvement efforts.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,5492,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0024968276,0
32560554,"Influence of High Temperature Synthesis on the Structure of Graphitic Carbon Nitride and Its Hydrogen Generation Ability. 1. INTRODUCTION. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is the organic polymer, based on heptazine (tri-s-triazine) building blocks. Heptazine tectons are linked into chains of the melon type through the C−NH−C bonds or into layers of fully condensed carbon nitride through the C−N(C)−N bonds (Figure 1). Both forms, melon and fully condensed g-C3N4, make graphite-like layered structures. In contrast to graphite, g-C3N4 is a semiconductor characterized by the band gap of ~2.7 eV [1,2,3]. Due to this property, g-C3N4 can be active in many photocatalytic reactions with the use of visible light [3,4,5,6,7], but also as a heterogeneous catalyst [8,9] and due to its layered structure and high nitrogen content as a flame retardant [10,11,12]. Graphitic carbon nitride is usually obtained by the air–atmosphere pyrolysis of a few simple and cheap organic compounds, e.g., melamine, dicyandiamide, urea, thiourea and their mixtures [13,14,15]. Over the last few years, much effort has been focused on the search of methods for enhancement of photocatalytic activity of carbon nitride. Attempts have been made to increase its specific surface area (SSA) using the hard template method [11,16,17,18,19,20,21] and to reduce the energy gap by doping with heteroatoms [22,23,24,25,26,27,28] or exfoliation [29,30]. Although these methods have been proved as effective, they are multistage and thus expensive. It has been recently shown that SSA and band gap can be simply modified by suitably adjusting the conditions of condensation. Carbon nitride can be synthesized in a wide range of temperatures (500–650 °C), time (1–10 h) and rate of temperature increase (2–20 °C min−1). All these factors, together with the type of organic precursor used for the synthesis have impact on the SSA, morphology, and energy gap of carbon nitride, so on its photocatalytic properties. The literature provides just a few reports on comparative analysis of the influence of the condition of synthesis on the properties of carbon nitride [31,32,33]. Their authors proved the influence of the type of precursor and temperature of synthesis on the properties of g-C3N4, although the results have been sometimes ambiguous. However, they did not check the effect of different rates of temperature increase, while according to literature data they can be of significant consequences. For instance, g-C3N4 obtained from melamine at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 (2 h, 550 °C) has SSA of 15.4 m2 g−1 [31], while at 10 °C min−1 its SSA decreased to 11.2 m2 g−1 [34]. Moreover, also the time of annealing at the target temperature has a considerable impact. Increase in the time of annealing from 2 to 3 h, at the rate of temperature increase of 10 °C min−1, results in the SSA increase from 11.2 to 14.0 m2 g−1 [32]. Zhao et al. [33] have found that in the process of carbon nitride synthesis from dicyandiamide, increase in the annealing temperature from 550 to 600 °C gives the increase in SSA from 18.1 to 30.6 m2 g−1. A comparison of literature data of SSA and band gap values of carbon nitride obtained from melamine and urea is given in Table 1. Unfortunately, the relations between the above mentioned factors have not been studied in detail as of yet, so it is difficult to choose the optimum conditions of the synthesis of carbon nitride from a given precursor. Moreover, no information on the yield of the final product is available and it is known that the efficiency strongly depends on the synthesis conditions. We have undertaken a study on the influence of the synthesis conditions on the efficiency of carbon nitride, as well as its physicochemical and photocatalytic properties. Growing demand for energy and the necessity of protection of the natural environment stimulate the search for new environmentally friendly and cheap sources of energy. Carbon nitride as a semiconductor is an excellent candidate for a photocatalyst in the reactions of photodecomposition of organic and inorganic compounds to get hydrogen [15]. Studies in the area have been initiated by the pioneering work of Wang et al. [6]. The carbon nitride activity in photocatalytic decomposition of water has proved rather low of just under 100 μmol H2 after 25 h of reaction. It has been improved by addition of 3% platinum to 250 μmol H2 after 25 h of reaction. The efficiency of hydrogen production can be improved by addition of some organic compounds (alcohols, acids) to water, these compounds act as the so-called sacrificial reagent [35]. On the other hand, methanol is one of the most popular solvents used in industry and its release to the environment is hazardous. One of the methods of its disposal could be its use as a sacrificial reagent in photodecomposition of a mixture of water and methanol [36,37]. This reaction was used in our study for evaluation of the photocatalytic activity of carbon nitride. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 2.1. PREPARATION OF G-C3N4. g-C3N4 was prepared by the pyrolysis of dicyandiamide (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany, 99%), thiourea (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), and melamine (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) in a semi-closed system according to a defined procedure. Typically, 4 g of each of above precursor was put into a quartz crucible (~50 mL) with a cover and heated at 550 or 600 °C in a muffle furnace for 0 or 4 h with a heating rate of 2 or 10 °C min−1 under ambient pressure in air (Table 2). The crucible was allowed to remain in the furnace until it cooled down to room temperature. The obtained yellow material was ground into a fine powder in an agate mortar (Table S1). The variable parameters of the synthesis were:. - heating rate (°C min−1);. - target temperature (°C);. - time of annealing (h);. - type of precursor: dicyandiamide (D), thiourea (T), melamine (M). The product obtained is labelled as “precursor-heating rate/temperature/time”, e.g., D-10/600/4 means the dicyandiamide was heated with heating rate of 10 °C min−1, at 600 °C for 4 h (Table 2).

32721227,"Retrospective Analysis of the Renoprotective Effects of Long-Term Use of Six Types of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors in Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease. Aim: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) provide renal protection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to elucidate the renal effects of long-term use of six types of SGLT2is in Japanese patients with T2DM and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Materials and Methods: The Kanagawa Physicians Association maintains a registry of patients who visit their 31 clinics. We retrieved clinical data of patients with T2DM and CKD who were prescribed with SGLT2is for >1 year. Results: A total of 763 patients with a median treatment duration of 33 months were included. The logarithmic value of urine albumin-creatinine ratio (LNACR) decreased significantly from 1.60 ± 0.65 to 1.51 ± 0.67. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the LNACR at the initiation of treatment, change in (Δ) diastolic blood pressure, and Δ hemoglobin A1c were independently correlated with ΔLNACR (P < 0.001). The decrease in the LNACR was significantly smaller in the patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [mL/(min ·1.73 m2)] of <60 (P < 0.05). The eGFR decreased from 77.4 ± 22.3 to 72.7 ± 22.5 mL/(min ·1.73 m2) (P < 0.001). The multiple linear regression analysis showed that the LNACR at the initiation of treatment, Δbody weight at the previous survey, ΔeGFR at the previous survey, and the eGFR at the initiation of treatment correlated independently with ΔeGFR during the maintenance period (P < 0.001). Greater changes in the eGFR during the maintenance period were observed in the patients with macroalbuminuria or eGFR of <60 (P < 0.01). Conclusions: The study confirmed that the long-term use of six types of SGLT2i improved the albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), although the eGFR gradually decreased during the treatment. The change in the ACR was significantly smaller in the patients with eGFR of <60 mL/(min ·1.73 m2) than in those with eGFR of >60 mL/(min ·1.73 m2).

32726803,"Papain-like protease regulates SARS-CoV-2 viral spread and innate immunity. The novel coronavirus SARS–CoV-2 is the cause of the current worldwide outbreak of the respiratory disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 generally has less severe symptoms and a lower case-fatality rate but is transmitted more rapidly compared with the related SARS-CoV, which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003. The SARS-CoV-2 genome shares high sequence identity with SARS-CoV. Both viruses critically rely on the activity of viral proteases: the main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro or non-structural protein 5 (nsp5)) and the papain-like protease (PLpro, the protease domain of nsp3) to generate a functional replicase complex and enable viral spread. SCoV-PLpro cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15, known regulators of host innate immune pathways, and inhibition of SCoV-PLpro has been shown to block SARS-CoV replication. SARS-COV-2 PLPRO PREFERENTIALLY CLEAVES ISG15. SCoV-PLpro and SCoV2-PLpro are closely related and diverge from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus PLpro (MERS-PLpro) (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Purified SCoV-PLpro and SCoV2-PLpro exhibit differences in their substrate preferences, as revealed by their cleavage of ubiquitin or ISG15 from substrates in HeLa cells treated with interferon-α (IFN-α) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). SCoV-PLpro strongly reduced the appearance of ubiquitinated substrates, with a lesser effect on ISGylated substrates, whereas SCoV2-PLpro preferentially reduced appearance of ISG15-conjugated (ISGylated) protein substrates (Extended Data Fig. 1b). We next used activity-based probes, namely a highly reactive propargylamide (Prg) ‘warhead’, which forms a covalent bond with catalytic cysteines, and a 7-amido-4-methylcoumarine (AMC) probe, which emits fluorescence upon cleavage, enabling the monitoring of the kinetics of the protease activity. SCoV2-PLpro preferentially reacted with the ISG15–Prg probe, but showed weak activity towards K48-linked di-ubiquitin (K48-Ub2) and Nedd8, and no activity towards SUMO-based Prg probes (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1c). SCoV-PLpro showed highest reactivity with K48-Ub2 Prg probes, and less reactivity towards the ISG15–Prg probe (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1c). This substrate preference was further confirmed using competition assays with increasing doses of K48-Ub2 (Extended Data Fig. 1d, e). In the reaction with SCoV-PLpro, K48-Ub2 effectively competed with both ISG15–Prg and ISG15–AMC, whereas competitive displacement was much less effective with SCoV2-PLpro. We also examined the catalytic efficiency (turnover number (k cat)/Michaelis constant (K m)) of both PLpro proteins (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Table 2), which indicated that SCoV2-PLpro cleaved AMC from ISG15–AMC more efficiently than from K48-Ub2–AMC, whereas SCoV-PLpro cleaved AMC from K48-Ub2 more efficiently. Of note, the apparent catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K m) of the two PLpro enzymes towards ISG15 were similar, but SCoV2-PLpro showed slightly higher specificity towards ISG15 (indicated by lower K m) (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Table 2). Consistently, SCoV2-PLpro bound ISG15 with a 20-fold higher affinity compared with K48-Ub2, whereas SCoV-PLpro bound K48-Ub2 with a 10-fold higher affinity compared with both mouse and human ISG15 (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Table 3). Indeed, the deISGylase activity of SCoV2-PLpro towards Prg- or AMC-based substrates, was similar to or higher than that of mouse USP18, a specific deISGylase (Extended Data Fig. 1f, g). Both PLpro enzymes also displayed weak deneddylation activity towards hyperneddylated CUL1, a common feature of dened-dylases such as DEN1 (Extended Data Fig. 1c, h, i). Together, these results indicate that SCoV2-PLpro preferentially cleaves ISG15 from substrates over ubiquitin chains and Nedd8 in vitro, whereas SCoV-PLpro targets ubiquitin chains and, to a lesser extent, ISG15 and Nedd8 (Fig. 1d). STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF SCOV2-PLPRO–ISG15. To gain insight into the molecular basis underlying specificity of SCoV2-PLpro–ISG15, we determined the crystal structure of a complex comprising SCoV2-PLpro(C111S) and mouse ISG15 (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2a). Notably, ISG15 displays two tandem ubiquitin-like folds. The overall assembly of SCoV2-PLpro and the two ISG15 domains was similar to the complex of MERS-PLpro with human ISG15 complex (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 6BI8; Extended Data Fig. 2a). The catalytic cysteine residue is also conserved in SARS (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Compared with the crystal structure of ISG15 in isolation (PDB ID: 5TLA), the N-terminal half of ISG15 is rotated by almost 90° and rests on the S2 helix of SCoV2-PLpro (Fig. 2b). The structure of SCoV-PLpro in complex with the C terminus of mouse ISG15 (PDB ID: 5TL7) showed that SCoV-PLpro and SCoV2-PLpro share the same binding mode to the C-lobe of mouse ISG15 (Extended Data Fig. 2c). We next compared the structure of the SCoV2-PLpro–ISG15 complex to that of SCoV-PLpro bound to K48-Ub2, in which the proximal ubiquitin is linked to the catalytic site. The main difference between these complexes is an interaction remote from the catalytic site, in which a protease S2 site binds the distal ubiquitin in the K48-linked chain, or the N-terminal ubiquitin-like fold in ISG15. Whereas SCoV-PLpro Leu76 mediates a hydrophobic interaction with Ile44 on ubiquitin, the corresponding residue on SCoV2-PLpro is Thr75 (Fig. 2c). To mimic the hydrophobic interaction observed in SCoV-PLpro, we generated two variants of SCoV2-PLpro (T75A and T75L). The T75L mutant, but not T75A, resulted in a K48-Ub2–AMC cleavage (Fig. 2d). This indicates that the presence and size of the hydrophobic residue at this site are critical determinants for ubiquitin binding. We also compared papain-like proteases from other coronaviruses, including the common human coronaviruses OC43, 229E and NL63 (Extended Data Fig. 3). The S2 binding site in papain-like proteases is poorly conserved across coronaviruses and exhibits variable hydrophobicity at the position corresponding to T",PMC,pos,1,pos,5522,pos_PMC,0.95643115,1

32796069,"Non-nucleoside Inhibitors of Zika Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase. Zika virus (ZIKV) remains a potentially significant public health concern because it can cause teratogenic effects, such as microcephaly in newborns and neurological disease, like Guillain-Barré syndrome. Together with efforts to develop a vaccine, the discovery of antiviral molecules is important to control ZIKV infections and to prevent its most severe symptoms. Here, we report the development of small nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) of ZIKV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity. These NNIs target an allosteric pocket (N pocket) located next to a putative hinge region between the thumb and the palm subdomains that was originally described for dengue virus (DENV) RdRp. We first tested the activity of DENV RdRp N-pocket inhibitors against ZIKV RdRp, introduced chemical modifications into these molecules, and assessed their potency using both enzymatic and cell-based assays. The most potent compound had a 50% inhibitory concentration value of 7.3 μM and inhibited ZIKV replication in a cell-based assay with a 50% effective concentration value of 24.3 μM. Importantly, we report four high-resolution crystal structures detailing how these NNIs insert into the N pocket of ZIKV RdRp. Our observations point to subtle differences in the size, shape, chemical environment, and hydration of the N pocket from ZIKV RdRp from those of the N pocket from DENV RdRp that are crucial for the design of improved antiviral inhibitors with activity against ZIKV.IMPORTANCE Zika virus belongs to the Flavivirus genus, which comprises several important human pathogens. There is currently neither an approved vaccine nor antiviral drugs available to prevent infection by ZIKV. The nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) polymerase, which is responsible for replicating the viral RNA genome, represents one of the most promising targets for antiviral drug development. Starting from compounds recently developed against dengue virus NS5, we designed and synthesized inhibitors targeting Zika virus NS5. We show that these novel compounds inhibit viral replication by targeting the polymerase activity. High-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of protein-inhibitor complexes demonstrated specific binding to an allosteric site within the polymerase, called the N pocket. This work paves the way for the future structure-based design of potent compounds specifically targeting ZIKV RNA polymerase activity.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,5531,pos_MEDLINE,0.996271,1
32817423,"Decoding three distinct states of the Syntaxin17 SNARE motif in mediating autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Syntaxin17, a key autophagosomal N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein, can associate with ATG8 family proteins SNAP29 and VAMP8 to facilitate the membrane fusion process between the double-membraned autophagosome and single-membraned lysosome in mammalian macroautophagy. However, the inherent properties of Syntaxin17 and the mechanistic basis underlying the interactions of Syntaxin17 with its binding proteins remain largely unknown. Here, using biochemical, NMR, and structural approaches, we systemically characterized Syntaxin17 as well as its interactions with ATG8 family proteins, SNAP29 and VAMP8. We discovered that Syntaxin17 alone adopts an autoinhibited conformation mediated by a direct interaction between its Habc domain and the Qa-SNARE motif. In addition, we revealed that the Qa-SNARE region of Syntaxin17 contains one LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which preferentially binds to GABARAP subfamily members. Importantly, the GABARAP binding of Syntaxin17 can release its autoinhibited state. The determined crystal structure of the Syntaxin17 LIR-GABARAP complex not only provides mechanistic insights into the interaction between Syntaxin17 and GABARAP but also reveals an unconventional LIR motif with a C-terminally extended 310 helix for selectively binding to ATG8 family proteins. Finally, we also elucidated structural arrangements of the autophagic Syntaxin17-SNAP29-VAMP8 SNARE core complex, and uncovered its conserved biochemical and structural characteristics common to all other SNAREs. In all, our findings reveal three distinct states of Syntaxin17, and provide mechanistic insights into the Syntaxin17-mediated autophagosome-lysosome fusion process.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,5537,pos_MEDLINE,0.9976993,1

Nonstandard Abbreviations and Acronyms cART combined antiretroviral treatment INSTI integrase strand transfer inhibitor MDMVs monocyte‐derived microvesicles MFI median fluorescence intensity NNRTI nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor NRTI nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor PI protease inhibitor TF tissue factor. Clinical PerspectiveWhat Is New? - Our data demonstrate a novel relationship between the surface protein and the release of tissue factor–positive microvesicles from monocytes during HIV infection. - Treatment of monocytes with HIV Tat recapitulated what was observed in clinical monocytes from those with HIV: (1) increased tissue factor expression, (2) decreased tetherin expression, and (3) increased release of microvesicles. What Are the Clinical Implications? - Future therapies could target tetherin to modulate microvesicle release, providing a novel treatment to ameliorate inflammatory aspects relating to HIV comorbidities and potentially for other microvesicle‐related inflammatory diseases as well. Age‐related inflammatory diseases are dramatically increased in the HIV‐infected population despite the success of combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) in repressing viral loads. , , One major contributor to this elevation is the activation of monocytes in patients with aviremic HIV, as evidenced by elevated levels of soluble monocyte activation markers sCD163 and sCD14 in plasma. Furthermore, both sCD163 and sCD14 have been linked to increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, , neurocognitive disorders, , and mortality , , in HIV‐infected individuals. One insufficiently studied mechanism of monocyte‐augmented inflammation is the release of microvesicles. Microvesicles, small membrane–derived extracellular vesicles ranging from 100 to 1000 nm in diameter, detach from the plasma membrane at lipid rafts , , and can contain surface receptors, proteins, lipids, mRNA, and mitochondria derived from the cell of origin. Acting as signaling shuttles, microvesicles communicate with recipient cells by binding to surface receptors or by delivering cargo through endocytosis. Microvesicles promote inflammation through multiple mechanisms, such as activating endothelial cells , or augmenting coagulation through tissue factor (TF) expression. , Higher rates of circulating microvesicles are linked to numerous inflammatory diseases, , , , , , many of which are prevalent in the HIV‐infected population. , , , Studies have also demonstrated that microvesicles from treated HIV‐infected individuals increase inflammation in endothelial cells. Despite their important impact during inflammation, little is understood about the processes regulating microvesicle biogenesis and release, particularly those emerging from monocytes. The plasma membrane protein tetherin (also referred to as BST2, CD317, and HM1.24) regulates virion release and provides a potential unstudied mechanism of microvesicle regulation. Using its dual‐membrane domains, tetherin physically sequesters budding enveloped viruses to the cell surface. As virions bleb from the plasma membrane at lipid rafts, either of tetherin's terminals are inserted in the envelope of the budding virion, thereby restricting viral release until both tetherin and the virion are recycled back into the cell for degradation. , Tetherin may additionally tether microvesicles, as their egress from the cell has striking similarities to virion release, as both occur at the curvature formation of lipid rafts. , A recently published study demonstrated that overexpression of tetherin in cultured cell lines can also tether nanoparticles (also known as exosomes) that are released when endocytic compartments fuse with the plasma membrane. Although microparticles and nanoparticles are similar in their ability to act as signaling shuttles and induce inflammation, these particles greatly differ in their biogenesis from the secreting cell. Microparticles arise from the plasma membrane, whereas nanoparticles emerge from multivesicular bodies. Thus, the focus of this study is to investigate tetherin's effect on microvesicle regulation. In this report, we investigated tetherin's ability to sequester monocyte‐derived microvesicles (MDMVs) to the surface of the cell during HIV infection. We demonstrated that tetherin levels are decreased on the surface of CD14+ monocytes in HIV‐infected individuals receiving cART and that these levels negatively correlate with the amount of circulating MDMVs in the plasma. In vitro studies performed with primary monocytes established that treatment with the HIV‐encoded protein Tat causes decreased tetherin expression on the surface of these cells and increased MDMV release. Further, a direct relationship between MDMVs and tetherin was established when mice lacking tetherin had elevated levels of circulating MDMVs and exhibited reduced time of bleeding cessation. This study investigates a novel mechanism of MDMV regulation by tetherin, discovering new targets for improved treatments in those with HIV and other microvesicle‐related inflammatory diseases.

A total of 1 392 reports on liver injury associated adverse drug reaction(LI-ADR) related to bone diseases were retrospectively analyzed based on national ADR monitoring system [18.75% of the patients used traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) alone and 68.68% used Western medicine alone]. This kind of cases accounted for 2.5% of all drug-related liver injury adverse reactions, ranking top ten of all drug categories. The number of reported cases and the proportion of serious cases showed an increasing trend from 2012 to 2016. The average age of the patients was(54.2±15.8) years old, and there was little difference in overall gender(male-female 1.04∶1). However, the number of female patients with rheumatoid arthritis was significantly higher than that of male patients(male-female 1∶2.6), while the number of male patients with gout was significantly higher than that of female patients(male-female 7.16∶1). The overall prognosis was good, with the recovery and improvement rate of 85.27%. The time from medication to liver injury varied due to different medicines.

32913695,"Bullous Skin Rash: A Rare Case of Palbociclib-Induced Dermatological Toxicity. INTRODUCTION. Palbociclib is a well-known cyclin kinase 4/6 inhibitor used in metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. It is most commonly used as a first-line treatment in conjunction with aromatase inhibitors. Neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, diarrhea, and skin rash are some of the reported adverse effects (AEs). The most common skin toxicities are grade 1, ranging from mild urticaria to pityriasis. More severe (grade 3) skin rash was less than 1% so far in the clinical literature as we found only one case of severe cutaneous toxicity presented as Stevens-Johnson syndrome [1]. Acute bullous skin rash is very rare and warrants immediate discontinuation of palbociclib. We report this case of acute bullous skin rash in a patient who was recently started on palbociclib for metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. CASE PRESENTATION. A 50-year-old female was diagnosed with metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. She initially presented with hip pain on the right side. MRI of the hip revealed multiple foci of signal abnormalities in the pelvic bones and bilateral femurs. She underwent a right-sided hip replacement, and the bone biopsy revealed a metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma with estrogen receptor (ER) 80%, progesterone receptor (PR) 15.3%, and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor not overexpressed. Further workup included CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and an MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, revealing extensive bony metastasis throughout the spine and pelvis but no evidence of visceral metastasis. Since the patient was still premenopausal at the time of diagnosis, she was started on tamoxifen along with monthly gosarelin injections for ovarian suppression. After her postmenopausal status was confirmed via hormone levels, she was switched to the aromatase inhibitor anastrazole. After a month, the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib was also added to the anastrazole. Two weeks later, she presented to her local oncologist office with a skin rash on her lower extremities. Upon physical examination, fluid-filled bullous lesions were noticed bilaterally on the dorsal surface of her feet with very few ruptured lesions present on the right foot and shin (Figures 1, 2). According to the patient, the lesions erupted around one week after she started palbociclib. The Nikolsky sign was negative. No evidence of oral mucosal involvement was seen. Palbociclib was immediately discontinued, and she was admitted to the hospital for close monitoring. No immunosuppressive agents, including topical corticosteroids, were administered. The bullous lesions started to erupt in the following days, and no new lesions were seen (Figure 3). She was eventually discharged from the hospital. Since palbociclib was the only medication started around the time of bullous eruptions and improvement occurred after abrupt discontinuation, we strongly believe these skin lesions were associated with it. Biopsy of the lesions could not be obtained due to personal reasons of the patient. DISCUSSION. Activation of CDK promotes cell cycle progression leading to abnormal cell growth. First-generation CDK inhibitors were initially studied for metastatic hormone receptor (HR+) breast cancer, but due to their pan-CDK inhibitions, numerous unacceptable toxicities were reported and their use was abandoned [2]. Therefore, selective CDK 4/6 inhibitors, such as palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib were introduced [3]. All CDK 4/6 inhibitors in combination with aromatase inhibitors are standard-of-care first-line agents in metastatic HR+ breast cancer [4-6]. CDK 4/6 inhibitors are associated with numerous AEs. Cytopenias are one of the most commonly reported AEs with these agents [7]. Palbociclib and ribociclib cause neutropenia in almost 70% of cases. Abemaciclib is very frequently associated with significant diarrhea [3], whereas ribociclib is known to cause QTC prolongation [8]. Skin reactions have been reported with CDK 4/6 inhibitors but are usually milder and do not warrant discontinuation of the treatment. However, bullous pemphigoid (BP) or bullous skin lesions have never been reported with these agents in literature. BP is an immune-mediated skin reaction that has been linked to several drugs, including mefenamic acid [9], etanarcept [10], terbinafine [11], and ampicillin [12]. More recently, dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors (gliptins) have been found to cause BP [13]. Full-blown BP is usually characterized by the presence of tense blistering lesions with desquamative gingivitis involving the mucosal surfaces, but localized lesions are also seen in 10% to 20% of cases [14]. Suspicious lesions should be biopsied and evaluated via direct immunofluorescence (DIF), which is the most sensitive test for bullous autoimmune diseases [15]. As mentioned in the case history, a perilesional biopsy could not be obtained in our patient, but classically appearing tense blisters without any other obvious predisposing risk factors except for recent initiation of palbociclib were highly suggestive of drug-induced localized autoimmune bullous disease. Identification of the offending medication is crucial and warrants immediate discontinuation of the agent. Studies have shown that localized bullous disease could be an early manifestation of an advanced and life-threatening BP; therefore, early identification of these lesions is essential [14]. Palbociclib was immediately discontinued in our patient. High-potency topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment. In one study, high-intensity topical steroid therapy was found to be superior to systemic steroids [16]. In some cases, glucocorticoid-sparing agents, such as azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil, could also be used [17]. Considering the subacute nature of disease in our patient, she was closely monitored without requiring any immunosuppressive agents.

33016878,"Ebola and Marburg virus matrix layers are locally ordered assemblies of VP40 dimers. INTRODUCTION. The filovirus family includes viruses such as Ebola, Marburg, and Sudan viruses that can cause hemorrhagic fever and severe disease (Feldmann et al., 2013). Filoviruses package their single-stranded negative-sense RNA genomes with viral proteins including nucleoprotein (NP), VP24 and VP35, into helical ribonucleoprotein assemblies called nucleocapsids (NCs) (Huang et al., 2002; Noda et al., 2010; Wan et al., 2017). NCs are recruited to the plasma membrane and bud from the host cells as enveloped virions with a characteristic filamentous morphology from which the family takes its name (Geisbert and Jahrling, 1995). The filovirus matrix protein, VP40, binds to and concentrates at the plasma membrane of infected cells, where it can interact with components of the NC to promote envelopment, and where it drives formation of the filamentous virus particles. VP40 is required for viral budding, and expression of VP40 alone is sufficient to drive formation of filamentous virus-like particles (VLPs) containing a matrix layer and membrane envelope (Harty et al., 2000; Jasenosky et al., 2001; Noda et al., 2002; Timmins et al., 2001). The morphology of these VLPs is similar to that of true virions but their diameter is smaller (Noda et al., 2002). When VP40 is co-expressed with NC components NP, VP24 and VP35, VLPs are produced which are almost indistinguishable from true virions (Bharat et al., 2012; Noda et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2017). A number of crystal structures have been determined of Ebola virus VP40 (eVP40) and Sudan (Ebola) virus (sVP40) (Bornholdt et al., 2013; Clifton et al., 2015; Dessen et al., 2000; Gomis-Rüth et al., 2003). VP40 contains an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD), linked by an intrasubunit hinge. Both eVP40 and sVP40 have been crystallized in space group C2 with similar unit cell dimensions. These crystals reveal dimers assembled via a hydrophobic interface in the NTD, involving residues A55, H61, F108, A113, M116, and L117 which are distributed across two alpha-helices (residues 52–65, 108–117). Disruption of the NTD dimer interface by site-directed mutagenesis prevents migration of VP40 to the plasma membrane and prevents matrix assembly (Bornholdt et al., 2013). Within the typical C2 crystal packing of unmodified VP40, eVP40, and sVP40 dimers are further arranged in linear assemblies via a hydrophobic CTD-CTD interface (Bornholdt et al., 2013; Dessen et al., 2000; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B). This interface involves residues L203, I237, M241, M305, and I307, which together form a relatively smooth hydrophobic patch (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). The CTD also contains a basic patch composed of six lysine residues (K221, K224, K225, K270,K274, K275), which is essential for matrix assembly and membrane budding (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). A crystal structure of Marburg VP40 (mVP40) has also been determined (Oda et al., 2016; Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). eVP40 and mVP40 have 42% sequence identity and a C-alpha RMSD of 2.4 Å in the NTD, but only 16% sequence identity and 5.6 Å C-alpha RMSD in the CTD. The overall topology of mVP40, however, is similar to that of eVP40. The mVP40 monomer has similar N- and C-terminal domains, although there is a small rotation of the CTD relative to the NTD when compared to eVP40. mVP40 dimerizes via an NTD interface that is very similar to that in eVP40, and mVP40 also forms dimers in solution that are required for membrane binding and filament budding. The mVP40 CTD basic patch is also required for membrane binding but is larger and flatter than that in eVP40. In the mVP40 crystal packing, the CTDs meet at an angle and do not form the more extensive hydrophobic interface observed in the C2 crystals of eVP40 and sVP40 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Deletion or proteolysis of the C-terminus or C-terminal domain or incubation with urea drives oligomerization of the eVP40 NTD into RNA-binding octameric rings (Bornholdt et al., 2013; Gomis-Rüth et al., 2003). Subsequent work suggests that octameric rings are likely to have a function during the viral lifecycle independent of matrix formation (Bornholdt et al., 2013; Gomis-Rüth et al., 2003; Hoenen et al., 2005; Hoenen et al., 2010b). In an effort to mimic membrane-associated electrostatic conditions, a crystal structure of eVP40 was determined in the presence of the negatively charged additive dextran sulfate (Bornholdt et al., 2013). Under these conditions, eVP40 assembled into linear hexamers (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D) with unit distances approximately consistent with earlier, lower resolution tomographic analysis of the VP40 layer in Ebola and Marburg virions (Beniac et al., 2012; Bharat et al., 2011). The core of the linear hexamer consists of four NTDs from which the linked CTDs are disordered or ‘sprung’ and not resolved. The first and sixth VP40s in the hexamer retain their CTD in close association with its NTD. These CTDs assemble into linear filaments via the same CTD-CTD interactions observed in the C2 crystals of VP40 dimers. The NTD-NTD interfaces within the hexamer alternate between the dimer interface and the same NTD-NTD interface observed in the octameric ring. No linear hexamer structure has been determined for mVP40. However, mutagenesis of residues in mVP40 homologous to those forming the ‘octamer-like’ interfaces in hexameric eVP40 (Bornholdt et al., 2013; Hoenen et al., 2010a) retains the ability of mVP40 to dimerize but prevents membrane binding and budding. Based on existing data it seems likely that VP40 is arranged in a similar way in both MARV and EBOV particles. The current model for the assembly state of VP40 within filovirus particles consists of VP40 hexamers as crystallized in the presence of dextran sulfate, arranged to form a 2D lattice, with dimensions of the 2D lattices in the model based upon repeating features observed in low-resolution cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) studies (Beniac et al., 2012; Bhara",PMC,pos,1,pos,5572,pos_PMC,0.9972638,1

BACKGROUND In patients presenting with recurrent pleomorphic adenoma (rPA), clinical evaluation can fail to recognize carcinoma ex PA (cxPA). We aim to identify the risk factors for cxPA. METHODS This is a single institution retrospective case-control study from 2000 to 2015. CxPA was diagnosed based on surgical pathology. Demographics, clinical, and social histories were collected. RESULTS A number of 13/106 (12.3%) patients were diagnosed with cxPA, of which only 4/13 (31%) had clinical features suspicious for malignancy.

Lipid miscibility phase separation has long been considered to be a central element of cell membrane organization. More recently, protein condensation phase transitions, into three-dimensional droplets or in two-dimensional lattices on membrane surfaces, have emerged as another important organizational principle within cells.

Eukaryotic Rab5s are highly conserved small GTPase-family proteins that are involved in the regulation of early endocytosis. Leishmania donovani Rab5a regulates the sorting of early endosomes that are involved in the uptake of essential nutrients through fluid-phase endocytosis. Here, the 1.80 Å resolution crystal structure of the N-terminal GTPase domain of L. donovani Rab5a in complex with GDP is presented. The crystal structure determination was enabled by the design of specific single-site mutations and two deletions that were made to stabilize the protein for previous NMR studies. The structure of LdRab5a shows the canonical GTPase fold, with a six-stranded central mixed β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices. The positions of the Switch I and Switch II loops confirm an open conformation, as expected in the absence of the γ-phosphate. However, in comparison to other GTP-bound and GDP-bound homologous proteins, the Switch I region traces a unique disposition in LdRab5a. One magnesium ion is bound to the protein at the GTP-binding site. Molecular-dynamics simulations indicate that the GDP-bound structure exhibits higher stability than the apo structure. The GDP-bound LdRab5a structure presented here will aid in efforts to unravel its interactions with its regulators, including the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor, and will lay the foundation for a structure-based search for specific inhibitors.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,5589,pos_MEDLINE,0.9976949,1
33138125,"Photocurable Methacrylate Derivatives of Polylactide: A Two-Stage Synthesis in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide and 3D Laser Structuring. 1. INTRODUCTION. Polymeric biocompatible materials have been in special demand in the new field of medical materials science, tissue engineering, associated with reconstructive surgery and the development of artificial organs [1]. Indeed, to design a new generation of implants applied in the replacement of lost or damaged tissues and organs, one needs materials with variable physicomechanical characteristics, which cause a minimum tissue reaction [2,3,4]. One type of such material is polyesters of aliphatic hydrocarboxylic acids, first of all, polylactide acid (polylactide, PLA) (Figure 1). Due to the specifics of its production and destruction, PLA occupies one of the basic places in the series of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers used in regenerative medicine and plastic surgery for reconstruction of bone and cartilage defects [5,6]. Besides, PLA is a thermoplastic polymer and may be processed by extrusion, molding, and blow molding. However, when using PLA as an initial polymer matrix for the implant design, it becomes necessary to alter a number of its characteristics, first of all, its fragility, low porosity, low thermal stability, and high hydrophobicity, leading to low cell adhesion to the material’s surface [7,8]. To improve cell adhesion and increase hydrophilicity and bactericidal properties of polylactides, a laser or plasma treatment of the polymer materials’ surface is used [9,10], with the addition of crosslinking agents carrying reactive groups—carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino groups, or their combination [11,12,13], as well as grafting of polymers with antibacterial properties [14]. The bulk properties of PLA, in particular, hydrophobicity, may be varied by synthesizing copolymers of polylactide with carbonates, lactones, glycolides, glycols, urethanes, etc. [15], or by graft-copolymerization, e.g., introduction of monomeric lactide in a hydrophilic polyethyleneglycol macromolecule [16]. Chemical modification of the PLA terminal groups may appear a promising approach to enhancing PLA hydrophilicity and affinity to cells with the simultaneous decrease of the polymer fragility. Copolymers of lactic acid with hydrophilic monomers are usually synthesized for this purpose. In particular, PLA copolymers with starch are obtained in toluene at 150 °C, followed by azeotropic dehydration [17], or by extrusion at 180 °C [18]. PLA copolymers with polyethyleneoxide are synthesized in toluene in a nitrogen atmosphere at 85 °C [19]. One of the most promising approaches to the structuring of polylactide (as well as other polymers containing hydroxyl groups, e.g., chitosan [20]), in which modification of the PLA terminal groups is applied, is the utilization of various techniques of thermal and photocuring, including laser stereolithography [21]. To accomplish this, new functional groups containing unsaturated bonds are added to PLA hydroxyl groups via esterification [22]. As the modifying agents, anhydride [23,24] or chloroanhydride of methacrylic acid [25] are most frequently used. Such reactions proceed in the presence of pyridine [26] or trimethylamine [27,28] in the liquid medium: in toluene [29], dimethylformamide [26], or haloalkanes [30]. One may also graft the double bonds to polyesters of hydroxyacids using a more advanced approach of urethane formation, with the use of diisocyanates and hydroxyl-containing modifying agents [31,32]. However, this method is only scantily described in the literature, though such reactions do not require toxic substances, such as anhydrides and chloroanhydrides of acids, tertiary amines, or pyridine [33]. This fact is probably related to the difficulties arising due to a higher sensitivity of urethane formation to the presence of even insignificant moisture, with the need to dry the reactants and the solvent and to conduct the reaction in an inert atmosphere. Earlier, we performed a modification of polylactide with the introduction of polymerizable acrylate groups into the macromolecule via the reactions of esterification and urethane formation of the terminal carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in a toluene or methylene chloride solution, respectively, which allowed obtaining 3D crosslinked structures by photopolymerization [29,34]. It should also be noted that all the above-mentioned ways of synthesis in the liquid phase involve the stage of product separation: reprecipitation, centrifugation, washing, and long drying. This leads not only to product losses but also to obtaining a resin-like mass as a result, inconvenient for further application since it is almost impossible to remove the solvent completely in common conditions. As reported in [22,35], a partial self-crosslinking takes place in such a case, resulting in the shelf life of the product not exceeding 1–2 months. We showed earlier that the esterification reaction in a solution had a degree of conversion limited by 65% [29]. When using urethane formation for PLA modification in a solution, we managed to raise the degree of conversion to 92%; however, the product state as a viscous mass did not allow its laser structuring application due to proceeding self-crosslinking [34]. Carbon dioxide is most frequently used as a supercritical state solvent for conducting various chemical reactions, that is, primarily related to its convenient critical parameters (31.2 °C, 7.3 MPa) and affinity to both polar and nonpolar polymer matrices. Besides, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) is capable of dissolving organic molecules of different polarities and disappearing from the system after the process completion that facilitates the separation and purification of products [36,37]. Earlier, using the scCO2 medium, the bulk properties of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) were modified by the synthesis of crosslinked methacrylate systems inside the UHMWPE matrix, which formed interpenetrating network structures with interesting mechanical properties [38,39].

33158864,"The 3.2-Å resolution structure of human mTORC2. INTRODUCTION. The serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–related kinase (PIKK) (1–3), controls cell growth by balancing anabolic and catabolic metabolism (1, 4). mTOR is found in two separate complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 (1, 5). mTORC1 consists of mTOR, regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor), and mammalian homolog of protein lethal with sec thirteen protein 8 (mLST8) (5–7). mTORC2 comprises mTOR, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor) (8), stress-activated map kinase-interacting protein 1 (SIN1) (9), and mLST8 (8), and associates with the facultative subunit protein observed with Rictor-1/2 (Protor-1/2) (10). mTORC2 is activated by insulin and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling (1) and acts on cell survival and proliferation (4) by phosphorylating the AGC family kinases: AKT, PKC, and SGK (1, 4, 11–13). mTORC2 also promotes tumorigenesis via up-regulation of lipid biosynthesis (14). mTOR inhibitors played a major role in the elucidation of mTOR signaling and are used in cancer treatment (15). The polyketide rapamycin specifically inhibits mTORC1 (6) by forming a complex with the cellular protein FKBP12 that then binds the FKBP-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain in mTOR (Fig. 1A) (16). Adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–like inhibitors target the ATP-binding site in the kinase catalytic domain of the mTORCs (Fig. 1A) or the structurally related PI3K (17). Recently, mTORC2-selective inhibitors were identified, but their mechanism of action remains unknown (18). Several intermediate-resolution reconstructions of (m)TOR complexes (16, 19–22) and high-resolution reconstructions of human mTORC1 (23) have been reported, but no high-resolution information on mTORC2 is available. Of the mTORC2 accessory proteins, only the isolated pleckstrin homology (PH) and conserved region in the middle (CRIM) domains of SIN1 have been structurally characterized (24–26). For Rictor, fold- and secondary structure–based models have been proposed based on intermediate-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions (20–22). RESULTS. STRUCTURE DETERMINATION OF MTORC2 BY CRYO-EM. To investigate the structure of mTORC2 and the mechanism of its regulation, we coexpressed recombinant components of human mTORC2 (mTOR, mLST8, Rictor, and SIN1) in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. The assembled complex, purified using tag-directed antibody affinity followed by size exclusion chromatography, was analyzed by cryo-EM (Fig. 1B and figs. S1, A to C, and S2) in the presence of ATPγS and either the full-length substrate Akt1 (fig. S1, D and E) or an Akt1 variant missing the PH domain (ΔPH-Akt1), or in the absence of Akt1 with and without ATPγS (fig. S2). The sample prepared in the presence of ATPγS and ΔPH-Akt1 yielded the highest overall resolution of 3.2 Å (density A in fig. S2). mTORC2 forms a rhomboid-shaped dimer (Fig. 1C) as observed in lower-resolution mTORC2 reconstructions (20–22). The mTOR kinase consists of the N-terminal “Horn” and “Bridge” domains followed by the FAT, FRB, and kinase domains (Fig. 1A). mTOR forms the core of mTORC2 with mLST8 on the periphery, close to the active site cleft, similar to mTOR-mLST8 in mTORC1 (16, 23). In the overall reconstruction, as a consequence of EM refinement of a flexible molecule, one-half of the dimer showed better local resolution (Fig. 1B, fig. S3, A to C, and movie S1). Therefore, focused refinement on a unique half of the assembly improved the resolution to 3.0 Å (density C in fig. S2), and these maps were used for structural modeling (fig. S3, D to F). Previous mTORC2 and yeast TORC2 reconstructions (20–22) revealed that the two mTOR FAT domains are in closer proximity to each other than observed in mTORC1 (16, 23, 27), and in the current structure, the distance between the mTOR FAT domains is further reduced (fig. S3G). Irrespective of these structural differences between the two mTORCs, the catalytic site in mTORC2 closely resembles the catalytic site in mTORC1 without Rheb-mediated activation (23), suggesting that mTORC2 may be activated by a yet to be defined mechanism. THE CHARACTERISTIC MTORC2 SUBUNIT RICTOR BLOCKS THE RAPAMYCIN BINDING SITE. Previous studies of mTORC2 subunits Rictor and SIN1 or their yeast orthologs were not of sufficient resolution to allow de novo model building, resulting in ambiguous or inconsistent interpretations (20, 22, 28). Here, we unambiguously model all structured regions of Rictor and the N-terminal region of SIN1 (Fig. 2, A to C), whereas the middle and C-terminal part of SIN1 retain high flexibility and are not resolved. The fold of Rictor differs substantially from previous interpretations (fig. S3, H and I) (20). Rictor is composed of three interacting stacks of α-helical repeats, here referred to as the ARM domain (AD), the HEAT-like domain (HD), and the C-terminal domain (CD) (Fig. 2, A to C). The N-terminal AD (residues 26 to 487) forms a large superhelical arrangement of nine ARM repeats (Fig. 2, A and B) that structurally separates the HD and CD. The HD (residues 526 to 1007), interpreted as two separate domains in previous lower-resolution studies (20, 22), is composed of 10 HEAT-like repeats. In sequence space, the HD and CD of Rictor are separated by an extended stretch of residues (1008 to 1559) that are predicted to be disordered and are not resolved in our reconstruction. We refer to this region as the phosphorylation site region (PR) because it contains most of Rictor’s phosphorylation sites (29). The two ends of the PR are anchored by a two-stranded β-sheet at the top of the HD, which is thus termed the PR anchor (Fig. 2, B and C, and fig. S4A). From here, a partially flexible linker wraps around the AD and the mTOR FRB domain extending toward the CD (Fig. 2B and fig. S4C). The structured parts of the CD form a four-helix bundle and a zinc finger, with bound Zn2+, in the vicinity of the Rictor N terminus (Fig. 2A and",PMC,pos,1,pos,5593,pos_PMC,0.9965166,1
33177626,"Ensemble description of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of the Nipah virus P/V protein from combined NMR and SAXS. INTRODUCTION. The Nipah virus (NiV), together with its close relative Hendra virus (HeV), is a zoonotic paramyxovirus responsible for severe encephalitis in humans. The NiV and HeV have been classified in the Henipavirus genus that also comprises the later on discovered Cedar virus (CedV). Because of their high pathogenic power, broad host range, high interspecies transmission and lack of therapeutics and vaccines, henipaviruses are classified as bio-security level 4 (BSL-4) pathogens and are considered as potential bio-terrorism agents. The genome of henipaviruses is made of a non-segmented, single-stranded RNA molecule of negative polarity that is encapsidated by a regular array of nucleoprotein (N) monomers to form a helical nucleocapsid. This N:RNA complex, and not naked RNA, is the substrate used by the viral polymerase for both transcription and replication. The viral polymerase is a complex consisting of the large (L) protein, which bears all the enzymatic activities, and the phosphoprotein (P). Through its interaction with both L and the nucleocapsid, the P protein acts as a tether and recruits L onto the N:RNA template. In addition, P also serves as a chaperon for both L and N in that it is required for proper folding/maturation of L and maintains N in a monomeric, RNA-free form. Therefore P is a pivotal protein endowed with multiple functions critical for both transcription and replication. The repertoire of P functions is further expanded by the peculiar coding capacity of the P gene. Indeed, beyond the P protein, the P gene also codes for the V and W proteins that are generated through the addition of either one (protein V) or two (protein W) non-templated guanosines at the editing site of the P messenger. The addition of these guanosines triggers a downstream frame-shift. The P, V, and W proteins therefore share a common N-terminal region (referred to as PNT) that constitutes a bona fide domain (i.e. a genuine functional unit) as inferred from the genetic organization of the P gene (Fig. 1A). The Henipavirus V and W proteins are key players in the evasion of the interferon (IFN)-mediated response via an antagonist activity of IFN signaling. V and W bind to STAT1, a key signal transducer in the IFN-mediated antiviral response, through their common PNT region. Binding of STAT1 by V leads to inhibition of STAT1 translocation into the nucleus, whereas binding to W leads to sequestration of STAT1 in the nucleus. The NiV P protein is endowed with anti-IFN function as well, indicating that the PNT domain common to P, V, and W is responsible for the IFN antagonist activity. We previously showed that PNT from both NiV and HeV is intrinsically disordered. The P C-terminal region (PCT) consists of an alternation of disordered regions and ordered regions (Fig. 1A). In fact, PCT comprises a disordered region (aa 407–469), referred to as « spacer » and overlapping with the reading frame of the C-terminal domain of V and W, a structured region responsible for the oligomerization of P (PMD, aa 470–578), a disordered linker and a structured region (X domain, XD, aa 660–709) with a triple α-helical bundle fold (Fig. 1A). We characterized the NiV and HeV V proteins and showed that PNT conserves its disorder also within the V protein, while the zinc-finger domain (ZnFD) has a predominant β conformation in agreement with predictions. In that study, we also experimentally showed that the NiV and HeV V proteins interact with DDB1—a cellular protein whose binding to V promotes STAT1 degradation—and concluded that the ZnFD plays a crucial role in strengthening this interaction. Although our previous study on the V proteins from both NiV and HeV has contributed to illuminating the conformational behavior of these proteins and has provided a conceptual asset to design new antiviral strategies to combat the ability of these viruses to escape the innate immune response, a site-resolved description of these proteins is still lacking. A major hurdle in this respect arises from the presence of their intrinsically disordered PNT region, which prevents crystallization and whose size constitutes a challenge for NMR studies. To fill this gap in knowledge, and as a first step towards an atomic description of the NiV V protein, we decided to investigate NiV PNT by combining small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and NMR spectroscopy. When we started this project, high-resolution data were already available for the first 35 residues of NiV PNT. Yabukarski and co-workers indeed solved the X-ray structure of a complex (herein referred to as N0–P1–50) made of a truncated form of NiV N unable to self-assemble (aa 32–383) and of the first 50 residues of NiV P (Fig. 1A). Only the first 35 residues of P were defined in the electron density. This Molecular Recognition Element (MoRE) forms two α-helices (αP1a, residues 1–19; αP1b; aa 21–28) separated by a kink (Fig. 1A). In that study, the P region encompassing the first 100 residues (P1–100) was also investigated by NMR spectroscopy on a small construct. Although the HN correlation NMR spectrum is typical of a disordered protein, the secondary-structure propensities (SSPs) calculated from Cα and Cβ secondary chemical shifts indicate the presence of five fluctuating α-helices. Upon addition of the N protein, only residues 50–100 remain detectable indicating that they remain flexible in the complex and that the N0-binding region of P encompasses residues 1 to 50. This latter region contains two conserved motifs in Paramyxoviridae members (i.e. soyuz1 ad soyuz2) (see Fig. 1B). When we were about to complete our NMR and SAXS characterization of NiV PNT, a study was published reporting the structural description of the NiV P protein. In that study, the authors combined NMR spectroscopy, SAXS, and X-ray crystallography and obtained an ensemble description of this large protein. Notably, they decided to use a “divide et impera” approach to disentangle the NMR spectral complexity o",PMC,pos,1,pos,5599,pos_PMC,0.99766326,1
33219127,"The flexible N-terminus of BchL autoinhibits activity through interaction with its [4Fe-4S] cluster and released upon ATP binding. Photosynthetic organisms utilize chlorophyll or bacteriochlorophyll to capture light for their energy requirements. The multistep enzymatic biosynthesis of both these compounds relies on similar pathways in the cell. One key exception is the enzyme utilized for the reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to chlorophyllide (Chlide), a key intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway (1, 2). Angiosperms use a light-dependent Pchlide oxidoreductase to catalyze the reduction, whereas gymnosperms, cyanobacteria, algae, bryophytes, and pteridophytes possess a light-independent enzyme called dark-operative protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (DPOR; Fig. 1A) (3). Photosynthetic bacteria that are anoxygenic rely exclusively on the activity of DPOR for synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll (3). DPOR catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of the C17 = C18 double bond of Pchlide, a porphyrin, to form Chlide, a chlorin (Fig. 1B), leading to a parental shift in the spectral properties required for photosynthesis (4, 5). Interestingly, DPOR is structurally homologous to nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for reducing dinitrogen to ammonia (6, 7). Like nitrogenase, DPOR is composed of two proteins: a homodimeric L-protein (BchL) and a heterotetrameric NB-protein (BchNB) (5, 8). BchL serves as the ATP-dependent electron donor, and BchNB is the electron acceptor containing the active site for Pchlide binding and reduction (Fig. 1A). Reducing equivalents of electrons are donated from ferredoxin to BchL. A multistep reaction cycle has been proposed for DPOR with the following overall reaction stoichiometry (Fig. 1B) (4):. Two such rounds of ATP-dependent electron transfer (ET) are necessary for Pchlide reduction, and the minimum stoichiometry of ATP/molecule of Chlide formed has been determined to be 4 (9). Given the structural similarity to nitrogenase, ATP binding to BchL is thought to promote its transient association with BchNB followed by a single ET to Pchlide. ATP hydrolysis drives the dissociation of the protein complex (9, 10, 11, 12). However, the details of how ATP binding promotes complex formation between BchL and BchNB are poorly resolved. Unlike nitrogenase, however, only two high-resolution crystal structures of the L-protein dimer have been reported: one in which the BchL dimer is complexed with ADP (PDB ID: 3FWY Rhodobacter sphaeroides BchL) (10) and another in which it is stabilized in a higher-order complex with the BchNB tetramer by the transition-state analogue, ADP–AlF3 (PDB ID: 2YNM Prochlorococcus marinus DPOR; Fig. 1A) (11). These structures reveal that BchL contains one [4Fe-4S] cluster at the dimer interface ligated by 2 conserved cysteine residues from each subunit (Fig. 1A). Each monomer of BchL contains an active site for ATP, including conserved phosphate-binding (Walker A, residues 38–45 in R. sphaeroides BchL) and hydrolysis (Walker B, residues 154–158) motifs. Each half of the BchNB tetramer contains a substrate (Pchlide) binding site and one [4Fe-4S] cluster that functions as the electron acceptor from BchL (Fig. 1A). This cluster is ligated by 3 cysteine residues from BchN and one uncommon aspartic acid ligand from BchB. In the structure stabilized with ADP–AlF3, the L-protein sits across the top of BchNB, placing their metal clusters in relative proximity (∼16 Å; Fig. 1A) (11). Thus, ATP binding is hypothesized to drive formation of the complex and ET, whereas ATP hydrolysis has been proposed to drive dissociation of the BchL–BchNB complex (11, 13). Additional functional control of DPOR activity is imparted through asymmetric Pchlide binding and ET events within the tetramer (14). In the homologous nitrogenase system, ATP hydrolysis occurs after the ET, suggesting that hydrolysis likely drives complex dissociation after the ET (12, 15). Given the structural similarities between DPOR and nitrogenase, we hypothesize that ATP hydrolysis similarly promotes complex dissociation in DPOR. Here, we address three outstanding questions about ATP usage by BchL: How does binding of 2 ATP molecules collectively transmit information from the ATP binding sites to the [4Fe-4S] cluster of BchL along with the interface where it complexes with BchNB? What role does ATP play in ET? Are both ATP-binding events necessary? We present the first crystal structure of R. sphaeroides BchL in the nucleotide-free state. This structure reveals a novel electron density for a flexible N-terminal region that is bound across the face of the BchL [4Fe-4S] cluster, suggesting a potential regulatory role. We show that amino acid substitutions within this flexible N-terminal region enhance the kinetics of Pchlide reduction, pointing to a functionally autoinhibitory role. We find that intersubunit contacts between BchL and bound ATP are critical for Pchlide reduction activity and that ATP binding promotes release of the inhibition through allosterically coordinated conformational changes. Together, our results support a model where ATP-driven cross stabilization of the homodimer promotes the release of the flexible N-terminus and allows formation of the BchL–NB complex activating ET and Pchlide reduction. RESULTS. CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF NUCLEOTIDE-FREE BCHL SUGGESTS REGULATION THROUGH A FLEXIBLE N-TERMINAL REGION. R. sphaeroides BchL was crystallized anaerobically in the absence of nucleotides, and a crystal structure was determined to a resolution of 2.6 Å (Table S1). The asymmetric unit contains four BchL chains: chains A and B form one BchL dimer and chains C and D comprise the other (Fig. S1A). The overall conformations of the AB and CD dimers are highly similar (Cα RMSD, of 0.55 Å). Comparison of the nucleotide-free CD dimer with previous BchL structures (Fig. 2, A–C) reveals an increasing compaction in the top face of the dimer from the nucleotide-free state to ADP-bound BchL (PDB ID: 3FWY, Cα RMSD = 1.62 Å) to ADP–AlF3–NB–bound L-protein from P. marinus (11) (PDB ID: 2YNM, Cα RMSD = 3.98 Å).

33238372,"Reporting of Hybrid Data and the Difficulties with Cross-Discipline Research Techniques. When each scientist begins their career, it is common to find a particular field of interest and then stick to it. Specificity to a particular field is fundamentally how science itself is organised and can be seen in the way in which it is currently taught and the way in which is it also published and represented. In terms of science education, this can be expressed in terms of an “hourglass” model, whereby science is taught from early childhood, covering a wide range of topics [1] and gradually focusing down during undergraduate and post-graduate studies to focus on a very specific subtopic [2]. Once graduated, post-doctoral employment forces the individual to expand their scope of knowledge until, at the eventual professorial level, their understanding of science is very broad and may laterally extend to completely different fields than the subject of their doctoral education (see Figure 1A). The corollary of this is that, as breadth of knowledge expands for the individual, the depth of that knowledge becomes shallower (Figure 1B). This is reflected in the role the scientist performs as they make the change from the bench to the office as their career progresses. The scope of avenues of current science are incredibly vast, so a separation of each field based on the inherent skills and ideas specific to each field seems logical. However, a difficulty can form when scientists begin to diversify and combine multiple fields into single research projects. Funding bodies are encouraging this practice in an effort to expand the potential impact of resulting research while also enabling the results to be published in journals that appeal to very wide readerships. This has created the rise of the multidisciplinary team with diversified researchers who are experts in their particular scientific niche being supervised by someone at a professorial level who is capable of seeing the “big picture” direction of the research [3]. This idea has been explained through the recent emergence of the idea of “systems biology” (ironically now its own field of investigation) that aims to bring together a host of “omic” style investigations to form coherent biological stories [4]. Proteomics, lipidomics, genomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics can all be combined to create holistic datasets that aim to fully understand biological problems from multiple perspectives. The principle that drives this integration of the sciences is simple: biology is complex, living systems are made up of a multitude of interacting parts, and the interaction needs to be understood in order for meaningful treatments with few side effects to be made available. The systems biology approach seems to be the future of research in life sciences. However, fledgling research is still being met with the hurdle of who precisely is knowledgeable enough to understand and adequately peer review the resulting data so that it can be published. This is further compounded by a lack of tools or accepted data representation formats that are able to integrate disparate datasets in a way that can be understood by a wide audience. Traditional publication avenues involve the opinion of experts who critique the validity of the experiments performed and the quality of the execution of the procedures used to generate the data. The data itself is then scrutinised and assessed with the help of statistics and other applicable benchmarks. The assessor then makes a ruling based on their own expertise, deciding whether the article is worthy to be published (an extensive investigation of peer review can be found in Bornmann, L. [5]). In fields that confine themselves to particular methods and understood workflows, this process works almost flawlessly (barring errant disagreement between learned individuals). The issue begins to arise when particular workflows are concerned with several highly disparate fields of expertise. An example that can be immediately brought forward is the field of Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI). Our own laboratory has published very actively in this field and, in our experience, publishing in this field is especially difficult. MSI is a hybrid field in science that combines some aspects of histology with aspects of chemistry and then produces data commonly seen in microscopy using mass spectrometry. After casual inspection, it becomes clear that deciding precisely where to publish this kind of data is a challenge. MSI uses a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation (MALDI) mass spectrometer to create spatial maps of targeted biomolecule classes. The spatial maps take the form of 2D images that show the location and relative intensity of a given molecule [6]. The dynamic range of the instrument allows for the analysis of virtually any class of biomolecule without the need for antibodies, elemental tags, dyes, fluorophores, or radio isotopes. Though this may seem straightforward, the issue becomes the translation of mass spectrometric data—a complex list of numbers—to literal pictures, and how these pictures need to be interpreted. When MSI data are reviewed, there are usually one of two responses. If the article is sent to an expert in mass spectrometry, the issue of statistics is often raised, since the proper application of statistics is the gold standard for data analysis in mass spectrometry. This however, is countered by the fundamental question of what should be analysed and which statistical tests should be used. On the other side, when a manuscript is reviewed by a histologist, then there is often a series of technical issues raised surrounding the pixelated nature of the data and the need to perform positive controls with antibodies or some other form of microscope-compatible tag or stain. This fundamental disagreement between the sciences creates a curious situation of papers that are MSI-focused but also contain additional data that have only been added to satisfy reviewers and editors.

33323510,"The Bactericidal Fatty Acid Mimetic 2CCA-1 Selectively Targets Pneumococcal Extracellular Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Metabolism. INTRODUCTION. Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality globally, being the major cause of milder infections, such as otitis and sinusitis, and more severe respiratory tract infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. To cause infections, the bacteria first colonize the nasopharynx and from there spread to other organs. If pneumococcal colonization could selectively be targeted by narrow-spectrum antimicrobials, we could potentially reduce the pneumococcal disease burden in society, without harming the entire residing bacterial flora. Penicillin has been the first choice for treatment for decades, but resistance rates are increasing, threatening effective therapy (1). Therefore, new approaches are required, and novel bacterial targets need to be explored. Bacterial fatty acid metabolism has been identified as an attractive target for antimicrobial drug development due to its essentiality for cell membrane biosynthesis and its divergence from corresponding mammalian systems (2–5). The de novo fatty acid synthesis pathway (FASII) utilizes acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) as a substrate to synthesize acyl chains on acyl-carrier proteins (ACP) with the combined action of enzymes encoded by the fatty acid synthesis operon (6, 7). Most Gram-positive bacteria utilize the PlsX/PlsY/PlsC pathway to catalyze the acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate and produce phosphatidic acid as a precursor for all phospholipid variants (8). Several inhibitors of enzymes in the FASII systems have been reported (2–5, 9). Such inhibitors might not be effective against pneumococci, as this species, like other bacteria belonging to the order Lactobacillales, can synthesize its membrane essentially entirely from extracellular, medium- or host-derived fatty acids and completely suppress their FASII system through transcriptional and biochemical inhibition (10–13). Transcriptional repression of the fab operon, encoding enzymes of the FASII system, is mediated by the transcription factor FabT (14). FabT has increased affinity for DNA binding in the presence of a corepressor, such as the FASII operon-encoded acyl carrier protein 1 (ACP1; locus tag SPD_0381) that mediates feedback inhibition of the FASII system when acylated with long acyl chains (15). Also, recently the auxiliary acyl carrier protein 2 (ACP2; locus tag SPD_0044) was described to mediate FabT binding as a cofactor when acylated with extracellular fatty acids (16–18). Biochemical regulation of de novo fatty acid synthesis occurs at its first step through acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibition by an unknown ligand that is postulated to be either acyl-ACP or acyl-PO4 (11). In Gram-positive bacteria, such as pneumococci, extracellular fatty acids are activated by a fatty acid kinase (FakA) and by fatty acid binding proteins (FakB) to initiate phospholipid synthesis (16, 19, 20). Phosphorylated fatty acids (acyl-PO4) serve as substrates for PlsY for lysophosphatidic acid formation from glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) or, after conversion by the acyl:PO4 transacylase PlsX to acyl-ACP, can be used as the substrate for PlsC to acylate G3P in position 2 for phosphatidic acid biosynthesis (21–23). In body fluids, fatty acids are mainly bound to carrier proteins such as human serum albumin (24, 25), and its bovine orthologue is used in in vitro experiments to supplement bacterial growth with extracellular fatty acids (11, 26). However, free fatty acids can also exert antimicrobial activity, which is exploited by the innate immune system (27–29), interbacterial competition (30), and their application as antimicrobial agents (31–33). Antibacterial mechanisms of free fatty acids are species specific and diverse (31, 33), including membrane solubilization, alteration of membrane fluidity, and uncoupling of protein interactions, leading to impairment of energy production or nutrient transport (34), as well as membrane pore formation (26) or inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis enzymes (35). In this study, we investigated the effects of the small-molecule compound 2CCA-1 and found that it induces a prominent autolytic and antimicrobial response in S. pneumoniae. Through analysis of resistant mutants, we identified 2CCA-1 as a fatty acid mimetic that is utilized by FakB3 to supply toxic building blocks for membrane phospholipid biosynthesis. The involvement of the transcriptional repressor of de novo fatty acid synthesis FabT in 2CCA-1 resistance revealed an additional role in modulation of fakB3 expression as a response to extracellular fatty acid concentration. Our data suggest that 2CCA-1 may act as a narrow-spectrum antibacterial agent whose activity is dependent on a protein, found in S. pneumoniae and related species, required for extracellular polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism (16). RESULTS. FIG S1. RESISTANCE TO COMPOUND 2CCA-1 INVOLVES INACTIVATION OF EITHER FAKB3 OR FABT. We identified compound 2CCA-1 as a novel inducer of autolysin-mediated lysis in S. pneumoniae. The alkylated dicyclohexyl carboxylic acid 2CCA-1 comprises a carboxylic acid linked to a central dicyclohexyl scaffold, which in turn is connected to a short aliphatic chain (Fig. 1A). Pneumococcal cell wall hydrolases are essential for cell division and growth (36) but are also involved in various lysis phenomena of the pneumococcus, such as autolysis upon antibiotic-induced cell wall synthesis inhibition (37, 38). The initial pneumococcal response to early-logarithmic-phase treatment with 2CCA-1 resembled the response to penicillin, with induction of lysis about 1 h after challenge (Fig. 1B) and comparable death kinetics for the first 3 h (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, as for penicillin, cell wall hydrolases are involved in the lytic response of the pneumococcus upon 2CCA-1 treatment (Fig. 1D) and speed up the death process, even though bacterial death also occurs in the absence of cell wall hydrolase activity (Fig. 1E) (37–",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,5627,far_neg_PMC,0.54899085,1
33338872,"Discrete-state stochastic kinetic models for target DNA search by proteins: Theory and experimental applications. 1. INTRODUCTION. In cells, genomic DNA molecules are gigantic polymers containing millions to billions of nucleotide residues. To regulate particular genes, transcription factors must locate functional target sites within particular regulatory regions in the genome [1]. For maintaining the genomic integrity, DNA-repair enzymes must detect damages buried among numerous intact nucleotide residues of the genome [2]. These DNA-binding proteins specifically recognize particular structural signatures in DNA. They can also interact with nonspecific sites on DNA. Although the interactions are weaker for individual nonspecific sites, the vast quantity of nonspecific DNA segments compensates for their weak affinity. Kinetic and thermodynamic efficiencies for the proteins to bind to their functional targets on DNA are strongly influenced by prior interactions with non-target sites on genomic DNA [3–6]. Target search processes of DNA-binding proteins have been intensively studied in the past five decades. Since Riggs et al. discovered astonishingly rapid target location by the lac repressor in 1970 [7], the mechanisms allowing the DNA-binding proteins to efficiently locate their targets on DNA have been studied both experimentally and theoretically [8–27]. Arguably the most impactful work in this area was a series of papers published in 1981 by Berg, Winter, and von Hippel [28–30]. These researchers theorized some of the key concepts for protein translocation on DNA and used them to explain biochemical data on the lac repressor. They hypothesized that proteins search for their targets on DNA via several translocation modes such as sliding and hoping. This work was remarkable in that these hypothetical concepts were postulated when only a very limited number of experimental methods and no crystal structures of protein-DNA complexes were available. Now, sliding of proteins on DNA is a well-established fact, which has been directly observed for many DNA-binding proteins in vitro and even in vivo by single-molecule methods [8,10,14,19–21,31]. Other methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [13,32], stopped-flow fluorescence [33–35], and elaborate biochemical approaches [36–42] also provide rich and quantitative information about how proteins locate their targets on DNA. In the 21st century, remarkable progress has also been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of target DNA search processes (e.g. reviewed in Refs. [15, 18, 23, 25, 43]). A large number of theoretical studies has utilized the so-called chemical-kinetic or discrete-state stochastic models for binding of proteins at nonspecific sites on DNA [5,44–57]. For convenience, we refer to them as discrete-state stochastic kinetic models. The main advantage of these models is that exact analytical expression for the mean search times can be obtained, as recently reviewed [25]. Many features of target DNA search (e.g., impacts of sequence heterogeneity, crowding, traps, DNA-looping, protein conformational fluctuations) were theoretically investigated obtaining the search time as an analytical function of experimentally measured parameters (rates, diffusion constants, length of DNA, etc.) for underlying processes and configurations [44–54,56]. Importantly, because the discrete-state stochastic kinetic models can provide testable predictions, they can also facilitate experimental studies of the target DNA search processes. By incorporating the models into experimental investigations, kinetic rate constants and other parameters relevant to protein translocation on DNA can be determined. The analytical functions of target search kinetics are particularly useful for such experimental investigations. In this review article, we provide an overview on discrete-state stochastic kinetic models, physical meaning of involved parameters, and experimental applications of the models. Showing some examples, we explain how these theoretical models can facilitate experimental analysis and interpretation of various biophysical and biochemical observations on the search processes. 2. DISCRETE-STATE STOCHASTIC KINETIC MODELS FOR PROTEIN TRANSLOCATION ON DNA. 2.1. JUSTIFICATION FOR DISCRETE STATES. In discrete-state stochastic kinetic models for protein translocation on DNA, discrete states are defined for proteins being bound nonspecifically at different sites on DNA. One might rather suppose that protein translocation on DNA should occur in a continuous (as opposed to discrete) manner. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations elegantly display continuous movements of proteins on DNA (e.g. Refs. [58–63]). Sliding of proteins on DNA is a random-walk process that is typically regarded as one-dimensional (1D) diffusion [28]. In the free state, a protein molecule undergoes diffusion in a three-dimensional (3D) diffusion. Obviously, it would be unreasonable to assume discrete states at different positions for the protein undergoing 3D diffusion in a solution. One may wonder why discrete states can be assumed for a protein undergoing 1D diffusion along DNA. What justifies the use of the discrete-state models? Unlike 3D diffusion, sliding is not a barrierless process. In other words, for the protein to slide to an adjacent site, the protein molecule must first break interactions with nucleotides at the current site. Solution NMR studies on nonspecific DNA complexes showed that despite perpetual changes in binding sites, nonspecific DNA complexes of proteins share many structural features with the corresponding specific DNA complexes with the targets [64–69]. In nonspecific DNA complexes, intermolecular ion pairs should be formed between protein basic side chains and DNA phosphates. The protein molecule must transiently break all of these ions pairs when it moves from one site to another on DNA. The requirement of breaking all ion pairs could represent an energy barrier for sliding [70]. In fact, for many proteins, the 1D diffusion coefficient f",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,5629,far_neg_PMC,0.0046727294,0

Microbial pathogens, such as Trypanosoma brucei, have an enormous impact on global health and economic systems. Protein kinase A of T. brucei is an attractive drug target as it is an essential enzyme which differs significantly from its human homolog. The hinge region of this protein's regulatory domain is vital for enzymatic function, but its conformation is unknown. Here, the secondary structure of this region has been characterized using NMR and CD spectroscopies. More specifically, three overlapping peptides corresponding to residues T187-I211, G198-Y223 and V220-S245 called peptide 1, peptide 2 and peptide 3, respectively, were studied. The peptide 1 and peptide 2 are chiefly unfolded; only low populations (<10%) of α-helix were detected under the conditions studied. In contrast, the peptide 3 contains a long α-helix whose population is significantly higher; namely, 36% under the conditions studied. Utilizing the dihedral φ and ψ angles calculated on the basis of the NMR data, the conformation of the peptide 3 was calculated and revealed an α-helix spanning residues E230-N241. This α-helix showed amphiphilicity and reversible unfolding and refolding upon heating and cooling. Most fascinating, however, is its capacity to inhibit the activity of the catalytic domain of Trypanosoma equiperdum protein kinase A even though it is quite distinct from the canonical inhibitor motif. Based on this property, we advance that peptoids based on the peptide 3 α-helix could be novel leads for developing anti-trypanosomal therapeutics.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,5634,pos_MEDLINE,0.9975466,1

33436498,"Cytoplasmic short linear motifs in ACE2 and integrin β3 link SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptors to mediators of endocytosis and autophagy. INTRODUCTION. A previously unknown coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the pathologic agent for an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019 (1). The virus, which is causing the new lung disease termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), has infected 40 million people and claimed over 1.1 million fatalities as of October 2020. It is hence posing an immediate health and socioeconomic threat with worldwide impact (2). Understanding how the virus infects and replicates within the host cell is crucial for the development of targeted therapies. Consequently, several large-scale mass spectrometry efforts have been focused on uncovering intracellular interaction partners of viral proteins (3–5) and on understanding how signaling pathways are affected by viral infection (6). Genome-wide CRISPR screening has also been used to identify essential host factors and pathways (7). Despite these studies, much remain unknown in terms of the molecular interactions necessary for viral infection and propagation. On the extracellular side, SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a human host receptor for cell attachment and subsequent receptor-mediated endocytosis (8, 9). Structural information on the interaction has been provided by cocrystallization of the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the ACE2 ectodomain and a cryo–electron microscopy structure with full-length ACE2 (10, 11). However, analysis of ACE2 expression across different human tissues reveals unexpectedly poor expression in the lungs as compared to, for instance, high expression in the kidney and heart (12, 13). The extreme damage that the virus can inflict on infected lungs indicates the requirement to use alternative receptors for host cell attachment and entry. In line with this observation, neuropilin-1 (NRP1), which is abundantly expressed in the olfactory epithelium, enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection and has been confirmed as a host receptor (14). The role of C-type lectins as interactors of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on innate immune cells has additionally been reported (15). Furthermore, integrins have been suggested as SARS-CoV-2 receptors due to the presence of a known integrin-binding RGD motif in the spike protein (16). An ACE2-integrin interaction seems structurally feasible based on a bioinformatic analysis performed by Mészáros et al. (17). Integrin-mediated endocytosis is used by a variety of viruses for cell attachment and cell entry (18, 19). In addition, integrin tissue distribution matches SARS-CoV-2 tropism more closely, which includes functional importance of integrin β1 expression on type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (20). Furthermore, there are, as of now, two case reports of COVID-19 patients with concomitant multiple sclerosis background, who were treated with natalizumab, an antibody that effectively blocks integrin α4 binding (21, 22). Both reports support a positive correlation between natalizumab treatment and mild COVID-19 progression. Integrins thus appear as plausible co-receptors of ACE2. Considerable research has been focused on the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and cell surface receptor proteins, particularly ACE2 (8, 9, 14–16). Further insight into the viral entry mechanism may be provided by investigating the downstream, intracellular, effects of the host cell receptor binding event. Taking a bioinformatical approach, Mészáros et al. (17) analyzed the cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrins and predicted them to contain a number of short linear motifs (SLiMs) that may link host receptor binding to endocytosis, autophagy, and signaling. SLiMs are typically 3– to 10–amino acid–long stretches found in the intrinsically disordered regions of the proteome. They may serve as binding sites and engage in dynamic protein-protein interactions (23). SLiMs are divided into different classes based on their functions and target domains. Well-known SLiMs mediating protein-protein binding include the class I PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)–binding motif x[ST]xΦ-COO− (where x indicates any amino acid and Φ indicates a hydrophobic amino acid) that directs PDZ domain–containing proteins to the C-terminal tails of target proteins (24); the endocytic trafficking motif YxxΦ that binds to the clathrin adaptor AP2 μ2 (25); and the LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which mediates interaction with the autophagy-related protein 8 (ATG8) domain–containing proteins MAP1LC3s (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 isoforms, also called LC3s) and GABARAPs (γ-aminobutyric acid receptor–associated proteins) (Fig. 1A) (26). Using the information on SLiMs stored in the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) database (27), Mészáros et al. performed a detailed bioinformatic analysis of potential SLiMs in ACE2 and integrins. On the basis of the presence of conserved consensus sequences that match previously established binding SLiMs, they predicted that ACE2 contains SLiMs that bind to class I PDZ domains, to phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, to AP2 μ2, to the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and to the ATG8 domains of MAP1LC3s and GABARAPs (Fig. 1, A and B). These SLiMs, if functional, would act as molecular platforms linking the receptor to the various biological processes associated with the interacting proteins. AP2 μ2, for example, is part of the clathrin adaptor complex formed during clathrin-dependent endocytosis (28). The PDZ and PTB domains, on the other hand, are well-established scaffolding domains implicated in the assembly of protein complexes and in receptor trafficking (29, 30). Hence, SLiMs on the cytosolic side of the host receptor proteins may allow the recruitment of proteins that enable and mediate receptor and concomitant virus particle internalization. Adding to the complexity, phosphorylation of Ser-Thr-Tyr residues may enable, disable, or tune a given interaction (31, 32). In the case of the ACE2",PMC,pos,1,pos,5646,pos_PMC,0.99709344,1

33597714,"The structural basis of function and regulation of neuronal cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2. INTRODUCTION. Cation-chloride cotransporters (CCC) are central to the regulation of intracellular Cl− concentration and have key physiological roles in neuronal excitability, trans-epithelial salt and water movement, and regulation of cell volume. In humans, there are two broadly distributed subfamilies: the Na+(K+)-coupled transporters NKCC1, 2 and NCC (SLC12A1-3) and the K+-coupled KCC1-4 (SLC12A4-7). The NKCCs and NCC utilize the energy of the Na+ gradient generated by Na+/K+ ATPase to accumulate cellular Cl− above its electrochemical equilibrium while KCCs utilize the outwardly directed K+ gradient to extrude Cl−. These transporters generate electrochemical Cl− gradients across the neuronal plasma membrane while channels dissipate them, and these interactions set the polarity and driving force of GABAA receptor-mediated chloride currents. The CCCs are strictly electroneutral transporters, NKCCs transporting two Cl− ions coupled to the movement of one Na+ and one K+, whereas NCC and KCC couple the movement of one Cl− ion and either Na+ or K+ respectively. From the kinetic analysis, there is strong evidence that in NKCC one Na+ and one Cl− ion bind before K+ binds, and it also appears that Na+ is released first on the inside; similarly, in KCC the kinetic evidence points to the ordered binding of first Cl− and then K+ from the outside. NKCC is inhibited by the loop diuretics bumetanide and furosemide and KCC is inhibited by the same compounds but at higher concentrations—NCC is evolutionarily close to NKCC but is inhibited by thiazide diuretics and not by bumetanide. NKCC1 and KCC2 are expressed in mammalian central neurons, in which a developmental hyperpolarizing shift in the action of GABA takes place during neuronal maturation because of an increase in the functional expression of KCC2. Thus, by raising [Cl−]i, NKCC1 is responsible for the depolarizing and sometimes excitatory GABA actions in immature central neurons, and also for the GABA-mediated (but functionally inhibitory) depolarization in adult sensory neurons, while the CNS-specific KCC2 determines the inhibitory GABA response in mature neurons by lowering [Cl−]i. All CCCs are feedback-regulated by the concentration of intracellular Cl−—this is mediated by the WNK (kinase with no lysine)-SPAK/OSR1 (SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase/oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1) signaling pathway. Any change in [Cl−]i is directly sensed by WNK kinases which phosphorylate SPAK/OSR1 kinases; in turn, SPAK/OSR1 directly phosphorylates threonine residues in the N terminus of NKCC to activate the transporter and promote Cl− entry and in the C-terminal domain of KCCs to inactivate that transporter. In the case of KCC2, membrane trafficking is also tied to phosphorylation of the protein and is thus an important component of KCC2 regulation, as is PKC-mediated phosphorylation of a serine in the C terminus; similarly, regulation of NKCC2 by phosphorylation has been shown to involve both changes in intrinsic transport activity and trafficking. A structural explanation for the coupling of phosphorylation to CCC transport activity is still not available, but in NKCC the mechanism appears to involve the movement of the C terminus and a change in the architecture of TMs 10 and 12. The critical role of NKCC1 and KCC2 in setting neuronal [Cl−]i and cell volume leads to a wide range of neuropathology when the CCCs or the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway are perturbed. Genetic defects resulting in altered expression or function of NKCC1, KCC2, WNK, or SPAK/OSR1 have been tied to the pathogenesis of seizures, neuropathic pain, cognitive impairment, cerebral edema, and neurodegeneration. Changes in Cl− regulation are likely to have an important role in the molecular etiology of a number of psychiatric and neurological diseases—since some of the deleterious effects on neuronal development and function have been connected with elevated [Cl−]i and/or cell volume and increased strength of GABA signaling, a number of recent efforts have focused on inhibition of NKCC1, inhibition of WNK-SPAK/OSR1, or on finding agonists to increase KCC2 transport activity and membrane trafficking. The promise of curing or treating these life-changing and life-threatening neuropathies drives the current quest for a full understanding of the CCC regulatory mechanisms. Although the properties of ion translocation, regulation, and inhibitor interactions of Na+ and K+ coupled CCCs have been extensively investigated until recently the molecular mechanisms have remained elusive due to the lack of structural information. Starting a decade ago, crystallographic structures of prokaryotic amino acid transporters AdiC, ApCT, and GkApcT in the same APC (amino acid-polyamine-cotransporter) superfamily enabled informative homology modeling efforts with moderate expected fidelity but little information as to ion-binding sites or regulation. With the rise of cryo-electron microscopy, structures of other APC family members have been reported, including one Na+-coupled amino acid transporter AgcS. Recently, four CCC structures, including the DrNKCC1, human NKCC1(K289N_G351R), human KCC1, and mouse KCC4 have been reported at 2.9–3.7 Å resolution, and these have revealed putative ion-binding sites and key residues likely involved in transport conformational change. Here, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we report the structures of human NKCC1 (hNKCC1a) and mouse KCC2 (mKCC2a) at 3.5 and 3.8 Å resolution, respectively. Our examination of human NKCC1 in an inward-open inactive state reveals conservation of key features in common with the reported NKCC structures and we combine functional studies with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal aspects of the structure such as ion binding and translocation, the identity of gating residues, and dimerization.

METHODS We obtained patient medical records associated with QT prolonging drugs from 3 different hospitals: the Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital (CMNH), Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) and Prince of Wales Hospital (POWH). RPAH and POWH admissions were taken between 4/01/2017 to 1/11/2019, and CMNH admissions were taken between 4/01/2013 to 24/06/2018. Demographic information and details of overdose were collected. All admission ECGs were manually measured. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between various QTc formulas and the frontal QRS-T angle. A Bland-Altman plot was used to examine agreement between manual and machine QT intervals. RESULTS 144 patients met the inclusion criteria for analysis. None of the patients developed torsades de pointes (TdP). There was no linear association between the QRS-T angle and the various QTc formulas (For QRS-T angle: QTcRTH: p = 0.76, QTcB: p = 0.83, QTcFri: p = 0.90, QTcFra: p = 0.13, QTcH: p = 0.97; For square root transformation of the QRS-T angle: QTcRTH: p = 0.18, QTcB: p = 0.33, QTcFri: p = 0.95, QTcFra: p = 0.47, QTcH: p = 0.33).

METHODS An online questionnaire covering demographics, uptake of and thoughts about the influenza vaccine was distributed by e-mail to hospital staff. Analyses identifying factors associated with vaccine uptake were conducted. RESULTS The response rate was 28% with 3,130 HCWs participating. Overall, 51% had received influenza vaccination. Formerly vaccinated participants were more likely to be vaccinated again. Perception of own gain, patient gain and a workplace recommendation were key incentives for vaccine uptake. The main reported reasons for rejecting vaccination were perceiving immunisation as a private matter, not feeling vulnerable to influenza and fear of vaccine side effects. Women, participants ≤ 49 years and participants with children living at home were less likely to be vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS To improve influenza vaccine uptake among HCWs, campaigns targeting newly employed staff should be conducted thereby establishing the basis for future vaccination behaviour. Efforts should be made to increase vaccine acceptance among women, younger employees and nursing staff. FUNDING none.

33740290,"Longitudinal transitions in patterns of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and psychological distress among South Korean adults with traumatic experiences. This study aimed to investigate transitions in patterns of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and psychological distress among South Koreans with traumatic experiences. This study consists of two parts: In Part 1 the time since trauma ranged between 0 and 41 years, while in Part 2 participants experienced at least one traumatic event within the previous three years. We identified subgroups and transitions between classes over a one-year period using latent profile analysis and latent transition analysis. First, in Part 1, four classes were identified at T1 and T2. Second, we explored whether age, sex, time since trauma, and time perspective (TP) predicted class membership at T1. Age, past-negative (PN), present-fatalistic, and future TPs were significant predictors of class membership at T1. Finally, sex, PN, and future TPs were identified as significant predictors of class transition over time. The same analysis was conducted in Part 2 with individuals chosen from the Part 1 participants. Differential effects of TP on class membership and transitions in PTSD symptoms and psychological distress indicated the need for intervention programs that consider the TP profiles of individuals with traumatic experiences.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,5694,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.002336783,0
33806674,"NMR-Guided Repositioning of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs into Tight Junction Modulators. 1. INTRODUCTION. Peptide and protein therapeutics, including non-natural cyclic peptides, are an emerging class of pharmaceuticals in drug discovery for unmet medical needs [1,2,3]. They are characterized by a large molecular surface with different functional groups that can provide higher affinity and specificity to the therapeutic target proteins compared to the authentic “rule-of-five” (Ro5) drugs. However, such “beyond-Ro5 drugs” have a critical drawback, which is their poor bioavailability. Peptide and protein therapeutics can merely penetrate the epithelial barrier to reach target organs. Paracellular transport across the epithelial cell monolayer is inefficient for molecules with a molecular weight of over 500. Therefore, most peptide and protein therapeutics and other beyond-Ro5 drugs are only administrated via injection. Consequently, there is an urgent need to address the development of oral, buccal, nasal, and/or transdermal methods of administration for beyond-Ro5 drugs [4,5,6]. Tight junctions (TJs) are intercellular adhesion machinery located at the apical-most space of polarized epithelial cells, which are composed of the transmembrane proteins claudins (CLDs) and occludin (OCL) [7,8]. CLDs and OCL are associated with several intracellular scaffold proteins, including zonula occludens (ZO)-1/2/3 proteins and ligand-of-NUMB X1 (LNX1) protein (Figure 1a) [9]. The former scaffolding proteins connect the membrane proteins of TJs to actin cytoskeletons. TJs play a pivotal role in the barrier function of the paracellular transport pathway. Accordingly, chemical modifiers of TJ integrity are expected to act as drug absorption enhancers for beyond-Ro5 drugs. To rationally discover the TJ-mitigating compounds, we focused on the protein-protein interaction of ZO-1 and CLDs. It has been shown that ZO-1 (and its close homolog ZO-2) is indispensable for the biogenesis of TJs and the maintenance of TJ integrity [10,11,12]. ZO-1/2 harbors three consecutive PSD-95/Discs large/and ZO-1 (PDZ) domains at the N-terminus of the protein. They follow a Src homology domain, the guanylate kinase (GUK) domain, and a long intrinsically disordered region that contains the actin-binding site (Figure 1c). At the same time, most (15 among 21) CLDs harbor a canonical PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) at their C-termini. A PBM is characterized by two to four consecutive hydrophobic/aromatic residues. For CLDs, -XXYV-COOH, where X is any amino acid, is the conserved key motif (Figure 1b). This motif is recognized by the first PDZ domain of ZO-1 (ZO-1(PDZ1)), originally shown by the domain-deletion mutant experiments [12], and this specific interaction with CLDs seems necessary for TJ formation. According to the literature, an exogenous expression of the engineered ZO-1 fragment, which harbors the first PDZ domain followed by an artificial dimerization domain, is sufficient to form CLD belt-like assembly on the cell–cell junction, similar to that of TJs [12]. The claudin–ZO-2(PDZ1) interaction was also shown to independently control TJ formation [11]. A combination of gene knock-out/knock-down experiments with ZO proteins resulted in the severe malformation of TJ structure with poor barrier function [13]. The structural basis of this critical interaction was further studied by X-ray crystallography [14]. In the study, the four most C-terminal residues of CLDs were shown to essentially contact the PDZ domain. In our previous study, we showed that the domain ZO-1(PDZ1) could weakly bind two different categories of small molecules, the head group of phosphatidylinositol phosphates [15] and baicalin/baicalein [16], at the same canonical CLD-binding pocket. We also showed that potential molecular competition between phosphatidylinositol phosphate and CLDs in ZO-1 binding may regulate TJ integrity [15]. In addition, either baicalin or baicalein could reduce the barrier function of the Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cell monolayer by ZO-1(PDZ1) inhibition in combination with the activation of the TGFβ signaling pathway [16]. Based on our previous observation, we chose several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as candidate molecules for screening ZO-1(PDZ1) inhibitors (Figure 2). We previously demonstrated that two NSAIDs, flufenamic acid and diclofenac, bound several PDZ domains with a broad specificity [17]. Among the examined PDZ domains, we observed a direct interaction between ZO-1(PDZ1) and either flufenamic acid or diclofenac with an estimated Kd of 0.7 mM and 1.4 mM, respectively. Both compounds possess a carboxylic group, and we interpreted that this carboxylic group was the determinant of PDZ domain binding. It should be noted that recognition of the C-terminal -COOH group of PBM is the essential molecular function of PDZ domains [18]. However, it is noted that most NSAIDs harbor a carboxylic group. NSAIDs competitively inhibit either cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, COX-2, or both, and the substrate of these enzymes is arachidonic acid [19,20]. Its carboxylic group is critical for COX binding. Therefore, we hypothesized that the other NSAIDs can bind to ZO-1(PDZ1) and inhibit the interaction between the ZO-1 and CLDs. This hypothesis is a conceptual extension of drug profile matching (DPM) in which a virtual affinity fingerprint of many compounds against a single drug target can be used to predict new candidate molecules for the other drug target with a similar affinity fingerprint [21]. In this study, we examined the direct interaction between ZO-1(PDZ1) and the nine NSAIDs listed in Figure 2 using the solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique. Five had weak but specific binding to the canonical binding site of ZO-1(PDZ1), indicating our expanded DPM approach is efficient. We selected some NSAIDs and subjected them to further pharmacological study of TJ integrity using MDCK II cells and the barrier function in Caco-2 cells.

33857207,"A model for the Twitter sentiment curve. 1 INTRODUCTION. In the last few years, the internet has become the main source for news for citizens both in EU [1] and in USA [2]. Such a rapid change in the media system has created a symmetric change in the way news are delivered: before the diffusion of the web, information was intermediated by journals, newspapers, radio and TV newscast, that represented the authority, being publicly responsible for the diffusion of reliable news. Nowadays, such intermediation is not present anymore: every blog or account on Facebook or Twitter assumes truthfulness just for existing online [3–6]. Due to this abrupt change of paradigm in the fruition of news, we observe a great increase of the diffusion of misinformation [7–9], that appears on the web via the use of automated [10–16] or genuine accounts [4, 16–20]. It has been observed that the diffusion of disinformation or misinformation campaigns leans on the emotionality of users [3, 4, 6, 21]. Twitter is one of the most famous microblogging service, where people freely express their views and feelings in short messages, called tweets [22]. Twitter is reknown to be used especially for the political communications [23], due to the limited amount of characters, perfectly suitable for political slogans, and for the quick sharing of messages. Due to the availability of its data, via the official API, it represents an extremely rich resource of “spontaneous emotional information” [24]. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a collection of techniques in order to automatically detect the positive or negative connotation of texts. An overview of the latest tools, updates and open issues in sentiment analysis can be found in [25–27] (see also the references therein). Some examples of applications, where predictions are formulated based on the sentiment extracted from on-line texts are provided in [28–35]. In [36], sentiment analysis is used to investigate the emotion transmission in e-communities; while in [37], it is employed in order to investigate on the interplay between macroscopic socio-economic, political or cultural events and the public mood trends, showing that these events have a significant and immediate effect on various aspects of public mood. The Ref. [24] provides a matrix-factorization method to predict individuals’ opinions toward specific topics they had not directly given. In [38], the authors consider the sentiment curve of Twitter posts along time in order to infer the causes of sentiment variations, leveraging on the idea that the emerging topics discussed in the variation period could be highly related to the reasons behind the variations. In [39], the authors present the data prediction as a process based on two different levels of granularity: i) a fine-grained analysis to make tweet-level predictions on various aspects, such as sentiment, topics, volume, location, time-frame, and ii) a coarse-grained analysis to predict the outcome of a real-world event, by aggregating and combining the fine-grained predictions. With respect to this classification, the present work can be placed in the stream of literature regarding the fine-grained analysis to model/predict the sentiment of Twitter posts. While an important body of research target the issue of predicting the information cascades [40–47], to the best of our knowledge, there are not works that provide models for the evolution of Twitter sentiment. We aim at filling in this gap, presenting a model that is able to reproduce the sentiment curve of the tweets related to specific topics and periods and to provide a prediction of the sentiment of the future posts based on the observed past. We achieve this purpose employing a recent variant of the Pólya urn, introduced in [48] and called Rescaled Pólya (RP) urn. In brief, the RP urn model differs from the standard Pólya urn for the presence of a “local” reinforcement, i.e. elements that are recently observed have a greater impact on the near future and may be identified as the “fashion” of the moment. In the online social networks applications, this local reinforcement aims at representing the persistence of an emotional response to a public event, capturing the phenomenon observed in [3]. Moreover, it is able to correctly reproduce the sentiment dynamics of the tweets, outperforming the standard Pólya urn model, as we will see, on several different data sets. Its prediction ability is also quite high. It is important to note that we also include a delay in information: indeed, it is plausible that, when the user decides to write the tweet posted at time-step n + 1, he /she only knows the previous tweets until a certain time-step t(n)<n. Finally, we underline that the proposed model may be also employed in other contexts. The sequel of the work is so structured. In Section 2 we will present the model: after introducing the standard Pólya model in Subsection 2.1, in Subsection 2.2 we formally describe the Rescaled Pólya urn model in general and, then, we focus on the case with two colors and, next to the general model (Complete model), we identify two special cases (“Only fashion” model and “No fashion” model). Finally, in Subsection 2.3, we explain how we include a delay in information. In Section 3, we describe the considered datasets and we illustrate the performed analysis and the obtained results. In Section 4 we comment the results and draw our conclusions. The paper is enriched by an appendix regarding the evolution of the estimated model parameters and additional analyses. 2 MODEL. 2.1 STANDARD PÓLYA URN. The standard Pólya urn (see [49–51]) is a stochastic model driven by a reinforcement mechanism (also known as “rich get richer” principle): the probability that a given event occurs increases with the number of times the same event occurred in the past. This rule is a key feature governing the dynamics of many biological, economic and social systems (see, e.g. [51]) and it seems plausible that it plays a role als",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,5720,far_neg_PMC,0.0023920655,0
33876640,"Hyperphosphorylation of Human Osteopontin and Its Impact on Structural Dynamics and Molecular Recognition. Protein phosphorylation is an abundant post-translational modification that adds an extra layer of complexity to the regulation of cellular fate, particularly in intrinsically disordered proteins because of their inherent accessibility. Regulation of cellular signaling by phosphorylation is associated with conformational changes and modulation of binding events and, recently, has been linked to the formation of membraneless organelles. The extracellular matrix (ECM) contains a large fraction of phosphorylated proteins, and many of them have been observed in breast and lung cancer samples. Among these ECM proteins, osteopontin (OPN) and caseins have the highest fractions of potential phosphorylation sites. OPN, also known as secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), is a secreted extracellular protein that exerts its functionality by binding to integrin and CD44 receptors and is reported to be implicated in apoptosis, wound healing, inflammation, tumor growth, tumor progression, and tumor metastasis. It is tightly regulated by glycosylation, phosphorylation and cleavage, and is secreted in its unphosphorylated or phosphorylated form. Human OPN is mainly phosphorylated by Fam20C (67% of the reported phosphorylated sites). Fam20C kinase is located in the Golgi lumen and responsible for most of the phosphorylation in the ECM. It recognizes primarily a S-x-E/pS motif but also shows a certain promiscuity with respect to other amino acid motifs (e.g., T-x-E or S-x-D). OPN contains 28 potential Fam20C specific motifs, causing ≤14% of the residues being phosphorylated. The degree of OPN phosphorylation has been associated with Raine syndrome, a rare disease characterized by generalized osteosclerosis with periosteal bone formation, characteristic facial dysmorphism, brain abnormalities, including intracerebral calcifications, and in some cases neonatal death. Its abnormal phosphorylation patterns are directly connected to Fam20C mutations. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of OPN regulates its binding interaction with hydroxyapatite and hence the formation and growth of the mineral phase in bone material, as well as bone remodeling and calcification. On top of that, ECM phosphoproteome homeostatis, in particular OPN phosphorylation, has been associated with tumor cell progression, macrophage migration, and host–cell interactions. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has matured into an exquisite tool to tackle PTMs and to study the structural dynamics of the protein of interest under nativelike conditions. Although denaturing conditions have been particularly useful for characterizing modified sites, it is important to take into account the fact that the conformational ensembles of IDPs are drastically affected by the presence of denaturing agents, as IDPs are far from being merely unfolded. With respect to OPN, several important features that account for the modulation of compaction, binding and function of the unphosphorylated form have been identified. Here, we present an NMR-based strategy for structurally characterizing the fully phosphorylated protein and the dynamics of the hyperphosphorylated OPN. For this purpose, a stable HEK293T cell line expressing Fam20C was used to obtain the pure functional kinase. The degree of phosphorylation and the homogeneity of the modified phospho-residue patterns were optimized in a controlled in vitro reaction. NMR signal assignment experiments reveal a downfield shift of a majority of the serine and individual threonine 1HN NMR signals due to intraresidue hydrogen bonding between the phosphate and backbone amide groups in unstructured regions. The experimental NMR data set is complemented by a mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The putative biological relevance of these findings is outlined with studies of the interaction with heparin and hyaluronic acid, which are present in proteoglycans and the ECM, and the comparison of our results to reported affinities for integrin receptors, natural binders of OPN. RESULTS. NMR/MS-BASED PHOSPHOPROFILING OF OPN. A highly pure unphosphorylated 13C/15N Homo sapiens OPN was expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli (Figures S1 and S2). The functional wild type (wt) and D478A (kinase-dead mutant) Fam20C kinases were expressed in HEK293T stable expression cells (Figure S3). The in vitro phosphorylation reaction of OPN was optimized from previously reported conditions (see the Supporting Information for detailed method protocols). A combined approach using MS and NMR spectroscopy was carried out for the identification of the phosphorylation sites. The results are summarized in Figure 1. The total sequence coverage of the MS/MS experiments is 68.5%, and 28 phosphorylation events are identified (see Figure S4). Among them, 17 of the 22 canonical motifs are found to be phosphorylated (S24, S26, S27, S62, S63, S195, S224, S234, S254, S263, S270, S275, S280, S291, S303, S308, and S310). A plausible alternative motif (T-x-E) is also found to be phosphorylated in position T185. Other phosphorylated residues do not follow the mentioned motif, although some of them were found to be phosphorylated in mammalian cells or bodily fluids (milk) (Figure S5), suggesting a certain promiscuity of the kinase and/or the activity of other unreported kinases. Among those (e.g., S162, Y165, and S169), previously unreported sites are reliably identified by MS on peptides GDSVVYGLR and GDSVVYGLRSK. The fragment pattern is continuous and shows the properties of phospho spectra. Resonance assignment by NMR spectroscopy was achieved for 78.7% of all HN signals (deposited in the BMRB as entry 50447 and Table S1). Twenty-eight phosphorylation events are identified on the basis of the 1HN downfield shifts (Figure 2). Twenty of the 22 canonical phosphorylation motifs are found to be phosphorylated (S24, S26, S27, S62, S63, S78, S81, S120, S126, S129, S195, S224, S234, S254, S263, S270, S275, S280, S308, and S310), and four noncanonical but plausible phos",PMC,pos,1,pos,5723,pos_PMC,0.99644804,1
33929702,"Chemical shift assignments of the N-terminal domain of PSD95 (PSD95-NT). BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT. PSD95 is a membrane-associated protein composed of three PDZ domains, followed by a src homology 3 (SH3) domain and a C-terminal guanylate kinase region. The N-terminal region of PSD95 (residues 1–71) interacts with a number of target proteins, such as calmodulin (Zhang et al. 2014), α-actinin-1 (Matt et al. 2018), and CDKL5 (Zhu et al. 2013). PSD95-NT also contains palmitoylation sites that are important for Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting (Greaves et al. 2011). The PDZ domains in the N-terminal portion of PSD95 interact with specific (Ser/Thr)-Xxx-Val motifs at the C termini of the target proteins. Such interactions mediate PSD95 binding to the central GluN2 subunits of NMDA-type glutamate receptors and to the auxiliary stargazin and related TARP subunits of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (Lim et al. 2002; Xu 2011). Thus, PSD95 mediates postsynaptic targeting of these receptors (Elias et al. 2008; Schnell et al. 2002). PSD95 plays a central role in Ca2+-mediated regulation of postsynaptic glutamate receptor localization that occurs during long-term potentiation (LTP), which depends on Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor (Tomita et al. 2005; Sumioka et al. 2010). Further-more, PSD95 is palmitoylated at N-terminal residues (Cys3 and Cys5), which is important for its postsynaptic localization and for postsynaptic targeting of AMPA receptors (El-Husseini et al. 2002). Intriguingly, Ca2+ influx also causes PSD95 relocalization (Sturgill et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2014; Chowdhury et al. 2018). Although structures are known for various PDZ domains and PSD95-NT bound to calmodulin (Zhang et al. 2014), atomic level structural information is currently not known for the full-length PSD95. We report here NMR resonance assignments of the N-terminal region of PSD95, which precedes the first PDZ domain and targets PSD95 (and bound glutamate receptors) to postsynaptic sites upon its palmitoylation of Cys3 and Cys5. These NMR assignments may be useful for the future screening and possible discovery of target proteins that bind to the PSD95 N-terminal domain. METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS. EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION OF PSD95-NT. A GST-tagged PSD95 N-terminal construct (residues, 1–71) (pGEX-4T3 vector) was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein overexpression and purification by following a standard protocol (Zhang et al. 2012). The 15 N/13C-labeled PSD95-NT was expressed in one liter of M9 medium supplemented with 0.5 g of 15 N-labeled NH4Cl and 2.5 g of 13C-labeled glucose. The purified GST-fusion protein was digested by thrombin to remove the N-terminal GST tag, producing an N-terminal fragment of PSD95 (residues 1–71, called PSD95-NT) that was further purified by gel-filtration size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75). NMR SPECTROSCOPY. Protein samples of 15 N- or 13C/15 N-labeled PSD95-NT were exchanged into NMR buffer containing 25 mM CD3COONa (pH 5.0) with 1 mM EDTA-d12, 1 mM DTT-d10 and 95% H2O/5% D2O. The isotopically labeled PSD95-NT was concentrated to give a final concentration of 0.4 mM in a final volume of 0.3 mL. All NMR experiments were performed at 285 K on a Bruker Avance III 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a four-channel interface and triple resonance cryogenic (TCI) probe. The 15 N-1H HSQC spectrum (Fig. 1) was recorded with 256 × 2048 complex points for 15 N(F1) and 1H(F2). Assignment of backbone resonances was obtained by analyzing the following spectra: HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO and HBHA(CO)NH. The NMR data were processed using NMRPipe (Delaglio et al. 1995) and analyzed using Sparky (Lee et al. 2015). ASSIGNMENTS AND DATA DEPOSITION. Figure 1 presents the 15 N-1H HSQC spectrum of PSD95-NT to illustrate representative backbone resonance assignments. NMR assignments were based on 3D heteronuclear NMR experiments performed on 13C/15 N-labeled PSD95-NT. The resonances (1HN, 15 N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, 1Hα, 1Hβ, and 13CO) were detected and assigned for all 71 residues. A non-native serine residue was detected at the N-terminus due to a cloning artifact and is designated as S0. Surprisingly, the N-terminal serine residue exhibits an amide resonance in the HSQC spectrum, which suggests that the N-terminal amine group must be modified somehow as an amide, perhaps caused by N-acetyl modification or another N-acyl linkage at the N-terminus. The residue numbering begins with the methionine at the second position, designated as M1 (Figs. 1, 2). The amide proton chemical shifts exhibited very narrow chemical shift dispersion (within 8.0–8.7 ppm), suggesting a solvent exposed random coil conformation for the entire 71-residue peptide chain, which is consistent with a lack of any ring-current shifted amide or methyl resonances. The backbone chemical shift assignments (1H, 15 N, 13C) for PSD95-NT have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu) under accession number 50752. The previous NMR structure of calmodulin bound to PSD95-NT revealed a helical structure for the first 17 residues of PSD95 (Zhang et al. 2014). Thus, the binding of calmodulin sequesters the N-terminal residues, Cys3 and Cys5 and prevents their palmitoylation needed for membrane targeting. The secondary structure of PSD95-NT in the absence of calmodulin (calculated by chemical shift index (Wishart et al. 1992)) indicates a random coil conformation for the entire 71-residue peptide (Fig. 2) that we suggest may increase the exposure and availability of Cys3 and Cys5 for palmitoylation by palmitoyl transferase enzymes. The chemical shift differences (ΔCα and ΔCβ in Fig. 2) suggest a slight propensity for an α-helix in the first 10 residues from the N-terminus; however, the magnitude of the chemical shift differences here are quite small and less than 2-fold greater than the experimental error. The helical structure of the N-terminal residues of PSD95 (residues 1–17) bound to calmodulin must be stabilized by the binding of calmodulin, because the PSD95 N-terminal helix conver",PMC,pos,1,pos,5736,pos_PMC,0.99769044,1

The α-Hairpinins are a family of plant defense peptides with a common fold presenting two short α-helices stabilized by two invariant S-S-bridges. We have shown previously that substitution of just two amino acid residues in a wheat α-hairpinin Tk-AMP-X2 leads to Tk-hefu-2 that features specific affinity to voltage-gated potassium channels KV1.3. Here, we utilize a combined molecular modeling approach based on molecular dynamics simulations and protein surface topography technique to improve the affinity of Tk-hefu-2 to KV1.3 while preserving its specificity. An important advance of this work compared with our previous studies is transition from the analysis of various physicochemical properties of an isolated toxin molecule to its consideration in complex with its target, a membrane-bound ion channel. As a result, a panel of computationally designed Tk-hefu-2 derivatives was synthesized and tested against KV1.3. The most active mutant Tk-hefu-10 showed a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of ∼150 nM being >10 times more active than Tk-hefu-2 and >200 times more active than the original Tk-hefu.

33939577,"Decreased temperature increases the expression of a disordered bacterial late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein that enhances natural transformation. INTRODUCTION. Proteins belonging to the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) family can be found in Archaea, Bacteria and Eucarya (predominantly in plants). Although these proteins have been intensively studied, the structural basis of their functions is poorly understood. LEA proteins exhibit critical functions linked to the ability to withstand stressful conditions such as cold temperatures and dehydration. The LEA protein family is divided into various subgroups based on sequence similarity. Known bacterial LEA proteins belong to groups LEA_2, LEA_4 and LEA_5 (following Pfam classification) [1,2]. Although their functions have not been extensively studied, these proteins play roles in resistance to abiotic stresses, including cold, freezing, desiccation and oxidation [3–9]. Many LEA proteins are intrinsically disordered and highly hydrophilic. The sequence analysis of prokaryotic LEA proteins has revealed that these sequences are not usually located in functional genomic islands but exhibit random locations in the genome and are distributed among bacteria via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [2]. Periodontitis is a common bacterial biofilm infection that destroys tooth-supporting tissues, leading in the worst-case scenario to the loss of the affected tooth. Periodontitis is classified into different categories based on its pathophysiology, stage, and grade [10]. Although periodontitis-related subgingival biofilms comprise various bacterial species, the majority of which are gram negative, some species may play a more pronounced role than others in the development of dysbiosis, leading to inflammatory reactions and the destruction of host tissues and alveolar bone (for a review, see [11]). One of these periodontal pathogens, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, is potentially aggressive and possesses many virulence factors, such as long bundled fimbriae, adhesion factors, cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), leukotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL), which play roles in colonization and biofilm formation, induce inflammation and help the opportunistic pathogen to evade the host immune defense system [12–14]. Moreover, some strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans are naturally competent; that is, they can take up eDNA and incorporate it into their genome [15,16]. For natural transformation to be possible, the species must exhibit a functional Type IVa pilus machine and proteins involved in homologous recombination, comprising Com (A, B, C, D, E, EA, F, E1), Pil (A, B, C, D), Rec2, ComM, and UrpA proteins [15,17–19]. Naturally, competent bacteria can use eDNA as a nutrient or as a source of novel genes to increase their robustness and virulence. A. actinomycetemcomitans displays virulence potential not only in the oral cavity but also in other parts of the body and is associated with abscesses in the brain [20], endocarditis [21] and rheumatoid arthritis [22]. The composition of the outer membrane (OM) is critical for various functions of gram-negative bacteria; in potential pathogens in particular, OM components such as LPS, proteins and lipoproteins play important roles in interactions with host cells. The abovementioned molecules have traditionally been considered proinflammatory agents, especially when released in vesicles, and they may operate as virulence factors that hamper host defense [23]. For instance, LPS is a well-known proinflammatory agent that sequesters the neutrophil-attracting chemokine interleukin (IL)-8 [24]. Similarly, various OM proteins (OMPs) of gram-negative bacteria have the potential to bind host inflammation-related cytokines/chemokines [25–28]. In the A. actinomycetemcomitans OM, we previously identified a lipoprotein that we named bacterial interleukin receptor I (BilRI) since it interacted with IL-1β [29] and various other cytokines/chemokines [30]. However, the biological role of this intrinsically disordered OMP as a biologically significant chemokine binder has been challenged by the finding that abundant A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS binds IL-8 with a higher affinity than BilRI [24]. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) do not exhibit well-defined structures in solution, and they may adopt various 3-dimensional structures when interacting with different ligands [31]. Our earlier study showed that BilRI was disordered in solution, which was supported by the presence of characteristic repeated sequences devoid of bulky hydrophobic amino acids, as well as unconventionally high solubility in water [30]. Despite the increased dynamics of IDPs and the lack of stable 3-dimensional conformations in these proteins, it is possible to determine the positions of transient secondary structure elements and conformational ensembles using biophysical tools such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) [32]. Information about the structural details of a protein may help define its role in the pathogen. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to shed light on the conformational properties of intrinsically disordered BilRI using solution-state NMR spectroscopy. Moreover, we studied whether BilRI, as an OMP facing the extracellular space, could be involved in cell–cell interactions via contact with host leukocytes and macrophages and whether BilRI is immunogenic in A. actinomycetemcomitans-positive periodontitis patients. In addition, we had no previous information about BilRI expression levels under different conditions. A. actinomycetemcomitans produces proteins that may bind various IgG molecules [33], and commercial antibodies against its proteins are unavailable. Therefore, protein expression studies based on detection with IgG antibodies could be problematic, especially when a low expression level is anticipated. Thus, we produced a mutant A. actinomycetemcomitans strain devoid of the bilRI gene that expressed the fluores",PMC,pos,1,pos,5741,pos_PMC,0.9785903,1

The phase equilibria of intrinsically disordered proteins are exquisitely sensitive to changes in solution conditions and this can be used to investigate the driving forces of phase separation in vitro as well as the biological roles of phase transitions in live cells. Here we investigate how using D2 O as co-solvent in an aqueous buffer changes the phase equilibrium of a fragment of the activation domain of the androgen receptor, a transcription factor that plays a role in the development of the male phenotype and is a therapeutic target for castration resistant prostate cancer. We show how replacing even small fractions of H2 O with D2 O increases the propensity of this fragment to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, likely reflecting a stabilization of the hydrophobic interactions that drive condensation. Our results indicate that it is necessary to take this effect into consideration when studying phase separation phenomena with biophysical methods that require using D2 O as a co-solvent. In addition, they suggest that additions of D2 O may be used to enhance phase separation phenomena in cells, facilitating their observation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,5746,pos_MEDLINE,0.99492985,1
33996326,"Fetal and Maternal Outcomes in Women With Major Placenta Previa Among Sudanese Women: A Prospective Cross-Sectional Study. INTRODUCTION. Placenta previa has a worldwide prevalence of 0.3%-0.5%, and it constitutes a major obstetric dilemma, with a high risk of fetomaternal mortality and morbidity [1]. Women with placenta previa were usually old, multiparous, had a (1) prior cesarean section, in addition, some may have had a history of the morbidly adherent placenta [1-3]. Other risk factors of placenta previa include infertility treatment, multiple gestations, smoking, male fetus, and black race [1,4]. The most common and fatal complication of placenta previa is massive obstetric hemorrhage, and increased morbidity is mainly due to blood transfusion, hysterectomy, and surgical injuries to the bladder, bowel, or ureter [2]. Babies born to mothers with placenta previa have a 15% chance of delivery before 34 weeks gestation. This puts the baby at risk for complications related to prematurity such as respiratory distress syndrome, growth restriction, low birth weight, and increased risk of cerebral palsy and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [4]. Hemorrhage of placenta previa is no longer a major cause of maternal mortality in developed countries due to the availability of protocols and well-equipped health facilities [5], which is not the scenario in the low-income sub-Saharan Africa where obstetric hemorrhage is still a leading cause of fetomaternal mortality and morbidity [6]. Sudan is one of those countries in which hemorrhage due to placenta previa still constitutes a major health challenge. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence, frequency of complications, and methods of surgical intervention among mothers suffering from major degrees of placenta previa in Khartoum, Sudan. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Study design and setting. A prospective, cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and complications among women with major degree placenta previa This study was carried in the period from January 1 to June 30, 2109, in Omdurman Maternity Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan. Omdurman Maternity Hospital is considered a referral center receiving patients from all parts of the Sudanese capital Khartoum. The policy of the hospital includes giving dexamethasone 12 mg I/M, two doses 12 hours apart for all patients diagnosed with placenta previa before 34 weeks gestation; also, all patients with placenta previa should have cross-matched blood ready before surgery. Data collection. A structural questionnaire was used to gather the data by the trained registrar in obstetrics and gynecology. Definitions. The diagnosis of major placenta previa was based on ultrasound or intraoperative findings. In our settings, MRI is not used as a secondary tool to diagnose placenta previa because it is not available at our hospital. Questionnaire. The questionnaire included gathering data on maternal and fetal complications along with other demographic data, including age, parity, occupation, education, weight, height, and residence. The recorded maternal complications include: hemorrhage, anemia, blood transfusion, wound infection, hysterectomy, injury to bowel, bladder, or ureter, ICU admission, and death. The fetal complications reported are prematurity, NICU admission, and fetal death. Blood loss is estimated by the total weight of abdominal gauzes used and subtracting the known weight of the same materials when dry. The difference in weight in grams approximates the volume of blood in milliliters. Statistics analysis. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) descriptive statistics was used for recording and analyzing data. Ethical considerations. Oral informed consent was obtained from all participants in the study. The study was reviewed & approved by the hospital ethics committee and the ethical committee of the Sudan Medical Specialization Board, and all patients consented to a possible hysterectomy if it became a life-saving procedure. RESULTS. The total number of deliveries during the study period was 22,000 deliveries of which there were 87 cases of placenta previa, thus the prevalence of placenta previa among our population was 0.4%. The mean age group, height, weight, body mass index, and parity were: 32.83 ± 3.35 years, 161.94 ± 6.68 cm, 84.2 ± 14.76 kg, 32.0018 ± 4.63, and 2.08 ± 4.7 deliveries, respectively. The mean number of cesarean sections was 3.04 ± 1.46. The majority of our women population were college graduates (55.2%; n=48) and the minority were illiterate (8% n=7). Almost half of the population were employees (44.8%, n=39) as compared to 43.7% (n=38) who were housewives. Seventy-nine point thirty-five percent (79.35%; n=69) of the population were from urban areas. Thirty-three point three percent (33.3%; n=29) of women had a previous history of placenta previa and only 2.3% (n=2) had a history of dilatation and curettage (D&C) (Table 1). Nine point two percent (9.2%; n=8) of all women did not require any intraoperative surgical intervention while the majority of cases who required intervention had responded to multiple uterine sutures (34.5%; n=30). Uterine backing, uterine artery ligation, and hysterectomy were performed in 20.7% (n=18), 12.6% (n=11), and 23% (n=20), respectively (Table 2). The mean gestational age at delivery, the average fetal weight, and the mean Apgar score at five minutes were 36.95 ± 5.77 weeks, 3.09 ± 0.288 kg, and 8.27 ± 1.53, respectively. Of all babies, the premature deliveries were 26.4% (n=23), 9.2% (n=8) were fresh stillbirths, and 38% (n=33) of them required NICU admission (Table 3). The most common reported maternal complication in the present study was intraoperative bleeding (71.3%; n=67). Forty-eight point twenty-seven percent (48.27%; n=42) required ICU admission. Bowel and bladder injuries were reported in 4.6% (n=5) and 28.7% (n=25), respectively. Of those who were hemodynamically unstable, 52.87% (n=46) received a blood transfusion.

34201246,"Cellular Chaperone Function of Intrinsically Disordered Dehydrin ERD14. 1. INTRODUCTION. Chaperone proteins have developed in evolution for the protection of cells against a variety of abiotic stresses, including drought, high or low temperature, osmotic stress, different salts, or heavy metals. These protective proteins come in a variety of shapes and forms as they need to be able to function under unfavorable conditions and on a plethora of different clients. One of the largest groups of chaperones are heat shock proteins (HSPs), originally identified as being expressed under conditions of elevated temperatures. These are complex globular proteins that come in a variety of sizes and utilize intricate molecular structures and interaction networks to fulfil their functions [1]. Nevertheless, not only globular proteins can serve as chaperones, as a growing body of information underlines the importance and efficiency of a chaperone class encompassing disordered proteins [2,3]. Dehydrins, which are categorized as Group 2 LEA (Late Embryogenesis Abundant) proteins, are such disordered chaperones that function in an ATP-independent manner [2]. Proteins in this family have multifunctional roles in stress response in many taxa [4]. They are generally characterized by high net charge and the presence of polar amino acids; they are enriched in glycine and lysine residues but are depleted in cysteine and tryptophan [5], suggesting a disordered character. Their categorization is based on the highly conserved segments that can be found in their sequences [6] in different combinations: (i) The K-segment is an approximately 15 amino acid long conserved lysine-rich motif present in all cold-expressed dehydrins. It can be found in multiple copies (1–12) within a dehydrin and, according to in silico predictions, it tends to adopt an amphipathic α-helix structure [7,8]. Presumably, K-segments can play a role in shaping the interaction with partner molecules, which is supported by our earlier observations [9]. (ii) The S-segment is a serine-rich region that can be phosphorylated, and, in most examples, it is wedged between the K-segments. The exact function of its phosphorylation is not yet known, but it may play a role in the protein’s delivery to the nucleus or in membrane stabilization. (iii) The Y-segment is a conserved region at the N-terminus of dehydrins that shows homology to the nucleotide binding regions of plant proteins and bacterial chaperone proteins. (iv) The ChP-segment is a highly charged, lysine-rich region that bears a strong resemblance to the charged linker region of the Hsp-90 chaperone protein found in animals. (v) The q-segment is a less conserved, apolar region composed of glycine or proline and alanine amino acids, usually located between two K-segments [6,10]. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes for 10 different dehydrins that probably have partially overlapping functions [11,12]. ERD14 is one of the A. thaliana dehydrins that belongs to the SK2 dehydrins subgroup, and it contains an additional hydrophobic region (H region) in its sequence. Its expression is induced under different stress conditions, such as heat and osmotic stress, and it can also be found in high quantities in rapidly dividing tissues, such as meristems [13]. In vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that ERD14 is a potent chaperone for a number of substrates [14,15]. Experiments with lysozyme, alcohol dehydrogenase, luciferase, and citrate synthase model substrates have shown that this protein is capable of preventing heat-induced loss of activity and subsequent aggregation of the enzymes [3]. They did not show, however, a chaperone activity in reactivating denatured proteins, and the exact mechanism of its chaperone function is yet unknown. Conserved segments in ERD14 create a specific pattern of charge- and structure-distribution that may be crucial for the proper chaperone function of the protein. The balanced distribution of charged amino acids throughout the full length of the protein results in a sequence that has a low overall negative charge (−9 at neutral pH resulting from 46 negatively and 37 positively charged sidechains) carrying a significant portion of charged regions (Figure 1). The N-terminal half of the protein is negatively charged, with two non-conserved, disordered regions of strong negative charge, while the C-terminal region partly compensates for this, mainly through the region of the Chp-segment consisting of 15 charged residues out of 18 (in green on Figure 1). K-segments (blue on Figure 1) achieve neutral net charges by alternating positively and negatively charged residues, a pattern that might be important in partner binding [9]. The S-segment (yellow on Figure 1), on the other hand, consists mostly of polar, non-charged amino acids, whose exact relevance is not yet clear, although phosphorylation of the serine sidechains may have a regulatory function. The H-segment (red on Figure 1) also lacks charged residues, but it is highly hydrophobic and contains several proline residues. This may be important for the recognition of exposed hydrophobic patches on partner proteins while also helping to keep ERD14 in a disordered structural state. In our previous work, we identified several different E. coli proteins bound by ERD14, supporting the idea of its promiscuous protein binding and protection. We provided evidence that ERD14 is localized in the cytoplasm during heat stress, arguing against its functioning through membrane protection [9]. Our in-cell NMR measurements also confirmed that the conserved K-segments that sample helical structural states in vitro [16] are the ones that participate mainly in molecular interactions, while most of the other regions remain disordered. Nevertheless, being able to bind proteins is not the only prerequisite of chaperones, highlighting the importance of the regions outside of K-segments in the function of ERD14.

34262173,"Structures of rhodopsin in complex with G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 1. SUMMARY. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) selectively phosphorylate activated GPCRs, priming them for desensitization. How GRKs recognize these receptors is debated, but a conserved region at their N-termini is essential for this process. Herein we report a series of cryo-EM single particle reconstructions of light activated rhodopsin (Rho*) bound to rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), wherein the N-terminus of GRK1 forms a helix that docks into the open cytoplasmic cleft of Rho*. The helix also packs against the GRK1 kinase domain, stabilizing it in an active configuration. The complex is further stabilized by electrostatic interactions between basic residues conserved in most GPCRs and acidic residues conserved in GRKs. Density for the regulator of G protein signaling homology domain of GRK1 and the C-terminus of rhodopsin are not observed. Crosslinking with mass spectrometry analysis confirms these results and helps explain how the docking of GRKs with activated GPCRs allows for phosphorylation of multiple sites. We identify GRK1 residues whose mutation augments kinase activity and crosslinking with Rho*, as well as those involved in activation by acidic phospholipids. From these data, we present a general model for how a small family of protein kinases can recognize and be activated by hundreds of different GPCRs. The activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) instigates intracellular signaling cascades that modulate a vast array of cellular processes. Desensitization of these GPCRs is triggered by a small family of GPCR kinases (GRKs), which selectively phosphorylate either the third cytoplasmic loop or the C-terminal tail of activated receptors, triggering the recruitment of arrestins and, typically, clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Because maladaptive overexpression of GRKs exacerbates conditions such as heart failure and cancer, GRKs have emerged as potentially important therapeutic targets. The seven vertebrate GRKs (GRK1–7) belong to the AGC kinase family and as such contain a protein kinase domain followed by a C-terminal extension (C-tail) (Fig. 1a). Located centrally within the C-tail is the active site tether (AST), a loop that contributes to the ATP binding site. The GRK kinase domain is inserted into a loop of a regulator of G protein signaling homology (RH) domain, a bi-lobed helical bundle that bridges the small and large lobes of the kinase domain. GRKs also feature a highly conserved ~16 residue element at their extreme N-termini. Truncation, antibody blockade, or mutation of this element can result in complete loss of activity towards receptor substrates (Extended Data Table 1). However, the mechanism by which GRKs recognize and are in turn activated by GPCRs is unresolved. Recent technical advances in cryo-EM have greatly facilitated structure determinations of GPCRs in complex with heterotrimeric G proteins and arrestins, which also selectively recognize activated GPCRs. Unfortunately, analogous GPCR–GRK structures are currently lacking, likely because such complexes are transient, anionic lipid dependent, and of low to mid μM affinity. Rhodopsin and rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) have co-evolved since the emergence of vertebrates in the rod outer segments (ROS) of photoreceptors to regulate scotopic vision, and as such represent a highly optimized system to study the GPCR–GRK interaction. Herein we report four cryo-EM structures of the bovine Rho*–GRK1 complex ranging from 7 – 4 Å resolution, crosslinking with mass spectroscopy (CLMS) analysis, and functional studies that reveal the molecular mechanism by which GRKs recognize activated GPCRs and a rare glimpse of a protein kinase being allosterically activated by its physiological substrate. ISOLATION OF THE RHO*–GRK1 COMPLEX. In initial attempts, we determined that the Km of GRK1 for Rho* in LMNG micelles decreased 6-fold relative to native ROS membranes (Km > 5.8 μM), and that addition of 5% c8-PI(4,5)P2 further decreased the Km by 2-fold, to 0.33 μM. In contrast, the Km for ATP remained constant (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). We also documented a significant increase in the activity of GRK1 against Rho* when incorporated into nanodiscs containing negatively charged lipids (Extended Data Fig.1b–c), and then identified a cluster of basic residues in the GRK1 α0 helix, which bridges the small lobe and RH domain, that are involved in this activation (Supplementary Discussion and Extended Data Fig.1c–e). Despite these improvements in apparent affinity, an intact complex still could not be purified. Treating Rho* reconstituted in c8-PI(4,5)P2/LMNG micelles with the amine crosslinker DC4 or MC4 trapped a super-shifted species of ~100 kDa, consistent with the anticipated 1:1 Rho* (40 kDa):GRK1 (61 kDa) complex (Fig. 1c). Crosslinking was most efficient in presence of sangivamycin (Sgv), an adenosine analog with 180 nM Ki against GRK1 and that previously was used to trap GRK6 in what was proposed to be an active configuration. Dark-adapted rhodopsin failed to crosslink (Fig. 1d) and an active site directed small molecule inhibitor (CCG224062) that stabilizes GRKs in an inactive state competed with crosslinking in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1e). The absorption spectrum of the purified complex also confirmed the presence of Meta II rhodopsin (Fig. 1f). Thus, the isolated Rho*–GRK1 complex was dependent on the activated state of both GPCR and GRK. Crosslinking did not strongly depend on the phosphorylation status of Rho* or whether its C-terminal tail was truncated (Supplementary Fig. 1). CRYO-EM ANALYSIS. This purified complex (Supplementary Fig. 2) was vitrified for cryo-EM analysis, yielding a 7 Å severely anisotropic reconstruction (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2, Extended Data Table 2). Interpretation of this map (Supplementary Discussion) suggested that affinity could be improved if GRK1 residues Ser5, Ser488, and Thr489, which are endogenous sites of autophosphorylation, were substituted with glutamic aci",PMC,pos,1,pos,5792,pos_PMC,0.99779594,1
34299007,"A Concerted Action of UBA5 C-Terminal Unstructured Regions Is Important for Transfer of Activated UFM1 to UFC1. 1. INTRODUCTION. UFM1 is a small ubiquitin-like (UBL) protein spanning 85 residues. Like other UBLs, it has a low sequence identity to ubiquitin, but shares its specific (β-grasp) fold [1,2]. Unlike other UBLs (except for SUMO), UFM1 has a single C-terminal glycine residue, by which UFM1 gets attached to target proteins using an E1-E2-E3 enzymatic cascade [1,3,4]. Initially, the UFM1 precursor protein gets processed by the two specific proteases UfSP1 and UfSP2 to expose the C-terminal glycine residue [5,6,7]. Processed UFM1 gets activated by UBA5 (E1), a member of the ubiquitin-activating protein family [8,9,10], from which activated UFM1 is transferred to the catalytic cysteine 116 of UFC1 (E2) [1,8,11]. The last step is the transfer of UFM1 to the target proteins mediated by the specific UFM1 ligase 1 (UFL1), showing no typical E3 ligases domain organization [1,12]. The mechanism of this step is largely unknown and other proteins could be required for UFL1 ligase activity as well [13,14,15,16]. The first identified target of UFM1 was Ufm1-binding protein 1 (UFBP1, also known as DDRGK1 or C20orf116) [12]. Since then, discovery of new targets for UFM1 and the characterization of functional consequences of their ufmylation has constantly increased. Recently, new ufmylation targets involved in cancer progression [16,17], DNA damage response [18,19], translation machinery [20] and ribosome functioning [13,14] have been identified. Taking in account the broad range of biological pathways affected by ufmylation, it is not surprising that impaired ufmylation can be connected to many human diseases [16,21,22,23,24] and seems to be essential for embryonic development [25,26,27]. The exact mechanism of ufmylation and the full range of physiological consequences are not well investigated yet. The key elements of the ufmylation cascade (UBA5, UFC1, UFL1) show significant evolutionary differences to the well characterized enzymatic UBL cascades (e.g., ubiquitin or NEDD8) resulting in a number of structural and functional deviations from the canonical E1-E2-E3 pathways [3,4,28]. In contrast to other E1 family members, UBA5 does not display the characteristic domain architecture [28]. This 404-residue protein possesses a single well-folded adenylation domain (residues 57–329), comprising the active site Cys250 and provides a platform for ATP binding and UFM1 activation [8,29]. Two UBA5 regions—the N-terminal (1–56) and the C-terminal (334–404) segments—appear to be important regulatory elements for the function of UBA5 and in the ufmylation cascade. The N-terminal segment 1–56 (absent in one of the two existing UBA5 splice isoforms) significantly enhances ATP binding and therefore increases efficiency and velocity of UFM1 activation. Additionally, the N-terminal extension accelerates UFM1 transfer to UFC1 from the UBA5~UFM1 conjugate in presence of ATP [30]. The UBA5 C-terminal part (Figure 1A) plays a complex regulatory role, consisting of a few conserved regions that mediate interaction of UBA5 with other key players in the ufmylation cascade [31]. The first sequence is a conserved region (R1, residues 334–348), interacting with UFM1 [10,29,30,31,32] and also with LC3/GABARAP proteins [31,33]. This region (called LIR/UFIM by its dual nature) is important for the initial binding of UFM1 to UBA5 [10,29,31,32] and for the following UFM1 activation in a trans-fashion [29]. Trans-activation means that UBA5 forms an active homodimer, like other non-canonical E1 enzymes, and UFM1 bound to the LIR/UFIM segment of one monomer exposes its C-terminal Gly83 residue to the catalytic Cys250 of the other monomer [29]. GABARAP (and to a lesser extend LC3) proteins interact with the same UBA5 region and inhibit UFM1 binding to UBA5, thus modulating the conjugation of UFM1 to UBA5 and to UFC1 in vitro [31]. No evidence for the activation of LC3/GABARAP proteins by UBA5 was found so far. However, we showed previously that interaction between GABARAP proteins and UBA5 facilitates membrane localization of the latter [33]. The second region (R2, residues 364–372) is significantly less conserved among different species than the first region, with only Gly367 being evolutionary invariant. The role of this region is not understood, and no interacting proteins could be identified so far. However, a A371T mutation in the human protein located in this region decreases the ability of UBA5 to activate UFM1, to transfer the activated UFM1 to UFC1 and to mediate UFBP1~UFM1 formation [25,34]. Another conserved region in UBA5 is located at it very C-terminus (R3, residues 393–404) and is predicted to have a helical conformation. Initially, it was postulated by analogy with canonical E1 enzymes that the UBA5 C-terminal part possesses an ubiquitin-fold domain, mediating UBA5 interaction with UFC1 [8,11]. Later it was shown that a short UBA5 peptide (residues 381–404) is solely responsible for this interaction [32]. UFC1, the only known E2 enzyme for UFM1, was characterized structurally [11,35] a few years after discovery of the UFM1 cascade [1]. The common architecture of E2 enzymes—four α-helices, four β-strands and one 310-helix (reviewed in [28])—is conserved for the UFC1 core (25–157). Lack of C-terminal α-helices and conserved motifs as well as the presence of an N-terminal α-helix, which stabilizes the UFC1 structure [11] result in structural differences, which classify UFC1 as a non-canonical E2 enzyme. Computational modeling (based on the existing crystal structure of the E1:E2 complex for the NEDD8 cascade) revealed that the second α-helix in UFC1 is the most probable site for interaction with UBA5. Indeed, the UFC1 K33A mutation significantly reduces both UBA5 binding and UFM1 transfer from UBA5 to UFC1 [11]. Despite these previous investigations, structural aspects and molecular mechanisms of the interaction between UBA5 and UFC1 are still largely unknown. Additionally, it is not clear, if other factors (e.g., UFM1 conjuga",PMC,pos,1,pos,5807,pos_PMC,0.99666256,1
34306580,"A Longitudinal Analysis of Social Skills and Adolescent Depression: A Multivariate Latent Growth Approach. ABSTRACT. Ample research has shown that the link between social skills and adolescent depression is signiﬁcant. However, how the changes in diﬀerent domains of social skills inﬂuence the change in depression from early to middle adolescence remains largely unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, the current research used longitudinal data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1061) to examine the inﬂuences of the changes in cooperation, assertion, responsibility, and self-control on the change in depression from early to middle adolescence. Univariate latent growth modeling showed that, from early to middle adolescence, adolescents experience decreases in cooperation and assertion, increases in responsibility and depression, and stability in self-control. Multivariate latent growth modeling suggested that adolescents who had more increases in responsibility and self-control tended to experience a slower increase in depression from early to middle adolescence; while adolescents who had more decreases in cooperation and assertion tended to experience a faster increase in depression from early to middle adolescence. The results suggested that promoting adolescents social skills might be particularly salient for the prevention of adolescent depression. 1. INTRODUCTION. Adolescence is a period of increased vulnerability to depression because of complex changes in biology, cognition, and social domains. According to the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), in 2018, 14.4% (3.5 million) of adolescents aged 12 to 17 in the United States had at least one major depressive episode (MDE), and 70% of these adolescents had an MDE with severe impairment. Adolescent depression is associated with a number of negative functioning. For example, depression may impair adolescents cognitive functioning, relationships with parents and peers, academic performance, and even suicide attempt (e.g., Clayborne et al., 2019). Moreover, depressed adolescents are more likely to develop depression in adulthood (Benjet et al., 2020; Rutter et al., 2006). For example, Johnson, Dupuis, Piche, Clayborne, and Colman (2018) found that adolescents with depression had 2.78 times increased odds of depression in adulthood. Not surprising, adolescent depression is also associated with poor outcomes in adulthood, such as low-income levels, low educational aspirations, and high substance use (e.g., Howard et al., 2019; McKenzie et al., 2010). Most clinical depression starts in middle adolescence, which makes it a particularly vulnerable time for adolescent depression. For example, one-year point prevalence rate of major depressive disorder (MDD) is much higher in middle adolescence (ages 15-18) than in early adolescence (ages 13-15) (Kessler et al., 2001). Given the severity, chronicity, and long-term negative consequences of depression in middle adolescence, it is important to investigate the protective factors of depression from early to middle adolescence. Social skill deﬁcit theory of depression (Lewinsohn et al., 1985) and competence-based theory of depression (Cole, 1991) illustrate that social skills are important protective factors for depression. According to social skill deﬁcit theory of depression, social skill deﬁcit is an antecedent of depression. On one hand, social skill deﬁcit is associated with negative self-views of competence and worth in relationships, ineﬀective self-regulation abilities (e.g., lack of resilience), and high levels of perceived stress (Fehlinger et al., 2013; Schnell & Herpertz, 2018), which may directly contribute to depression. On the other, social buﬀering theories posit that social skill deﬁcit may indirectly increase ones vulnerability to depression by reducing social support or positive social reinforcement (Cohen & Wills, 1985; Moeller & Seehuus, 2019; Nilsen et al., 2013), as social support acts as a buﬀer against stressful events. Especially for adolescents who spend much time with age-mates and put great stock in the expectations and opinions of peers, lack of social support from peers may particularly exacerbate adolescent depression. In addition, competencebased theory of depression also posits that, social skill, as a competence in social domain, is a protective factor of depression (Cole, 1991). According to this theory, individuals receive competence feedback from many informants and internalize the feedback into the perception of self, and self-perception function as a strong inﬂuencing factor of depression. Basedon it, adolescents with high levels of social skills would receive more positive feedback in social interactions, and the positive feedback helps them build a positive perception of self (e.g., I am liked by others), which may protect them from depression. Although there aresubstantial empirical research studies demonstrating the association between social skills and adolescent depression (e.g., Feldman et al., 2017; Nilsen et al., 2013; Schiltz et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019), there does not appear to be any work investigating how the change in social skills inﬂuence the change in depression from early to middle adolescence. As discussed above, the prevalence of adolescent depression increases dramatically in middle adolescence. Thus, in order to develop eﬀective preventions for adolescent depression, researchers should not only depend on an understanding of the links between social skills and adolescent depression at given time, but also on an understanding of how the change in social skills is related with the change in adolescent depression from early to middle adolescence. In addition, the prior work has not paid sufﬁcient attention to the diﬀerent domains of social skills and their speciﬁc inﬂuences on adolescent depression. Social skill has been deﬁned as a class of learned, socially acceptable behaviors across a wide array of functional domains that allow an indivi",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,5810,far_neg_PMC,0.0021364216,0
34389544,"Structural and biochemical advances on the recruitment of the autophagy-initiating ULK and TBK1 complexes by autophagy receptor NDP52. INTRODUCTION. Autophagy is a highly regulated lysosome-dependent intracellular process that maintains cell homeostasis and/or cope with external stresses via degradation of superfluous or harmful cytosolic components, including damaged organelles and cytosol-invading pathogens (1–3). In contrast to the traditional “bulk” autophagy process that nonselectively engulfs cytoplasmic debris for autophagic degradation, a large number of selective autophagy processes that require specific cargo recognition and targeting by the autophagy machinery have been found recently (2, 4–6), such as xenophagy (the selective autophagy of invading pathogens) (7–9), mitophagy (the selective autophagy of dysfunctional mitochondria) (10–12), aggrephagy (the selective autophagy of protein aggregates) (13–15), and ER-phagy (the selective autophagy of endoplasmic reticulum) (16–21). Meanwhile, a set of unique adaptor proteins termed as autophagy receptors have been identified to play essential roles in these selective autophagy processes, such as Sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1/P62), NDP52, Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1), Next to BRCA1 gene 1 protein (NBR1), Optineurin, Nix, FUN14 domain-containing protein 1 (FUNDC1), Cell cycle progression protein 1 (CCPG1), Reticulophagy regulator 1 (RETREG1, also known as FAM134B), Testis-expressed protein 264 (TEX264), Reticulon-3 (RTN3), Atlastin-3 (ATL3), and Sec62 in mammals (22–24). As a master factor in selective autophagy, each autophagy receptor contains a cargo-associating domain that can specifically decorate prospective autophagic cargoes, and a unique LC3 (Microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3, MAP1LC3)-interacting region (LIR) that can recognize the key autophagic factors, ATG8 family proteins, including LC3A, LC3B, LC3C, GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2 in mammals (5, 22, 24–29). During selective autophagy, after recognization of relevant autophagic cargo, autophagy receptor can subsequently and effectively induce autophagosome formation in close proximity to the targeting cargo by recruiting relevant autophagy machinery. However, until now, many of the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the in situ initiation of autophagosome formation by autophagy receptors during selective autophagy are still not well understood. NDP52 (also known as CALCOCO2) is a crucial multifunctional autophagy receptor in mammals and plays important roles in selective autophagic degradations of invading infectious pathogens such as Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (7, 30, 31), depolarized mitochondria (12, 32), specific functional proteins such as Endoribonuclease Dicer and Argonaute-2 related to the microRNA pathway (33), and retrotransposon RNA (34). As a multidomain-containing autophagy receptor, NDP52 contain an N-terminal SKIP carboxyl homology (SKICH) domain, an unconventional LIR motif that can specifically bind to LC3C (35), a middle coiled-coil region for the self-dimerization of NDP52 (36), a Galectin8-interacting region (GIR) (31), and two C-terminal zinc fingers that can mediate the interactions of NDP52 with the Myosin6 motor for autophagosome maturation and ubiquitin molecules decorated on relevant cargoes (Fig. 1A) (27, 37–39). Notably, the SKICH domain of NDP52 can directly bind to two closely related adaptor proteins NAP1 and TANK-binding kinase 1-binding protein 1 (TBKBP1, also known as SINTBAD), which, in turn, can recruit the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) for NDP52 through their respective C-terminal TBK1-binding domains (TBD) (7, 36, 40, 41). The recruitment of TBK1 complex by NDP52 and the kinase activity of TBK1 are both required for the NDP52-mediated selective autophagy processes (7, 42). The active TBK1 can directly phosphorylate NDP52 (32, 43), but the precise downstream effects imposed by this TBK1-mediated NDP52 phosphorylation event are still poorly understood. Notably, except for binding to NAP1 and SINTBAD, the SKICH domain of NDP52 are also recently reported to interact with RB1CC1 (also known as FIP200) (44, 45), which is a large subunit of the autophagy initiation ULK complex and mainly contains an N-terminal domain, an LIR motif, and several coiled-coil regions followed by an extreme C-terminal Claw domain (Fig. 1A). The interaction between NDP52 SKICH and RB1CC1 is essential for the recruitment of ULK complex as well as the subsequent initiation of autophagosome formation during NDP52-mediated xenophagy and mitophagy processes (44, 45). However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underpinning the specific interaction of RB1CC1 with NDP52 SKICH as well as the relationship between NAP1 and RB1CC1 in binding to NDP52 SKICH remain elusive. As a key regulator in the initiation of autophagy, the ULK complex in mammals is composed of four subunits, a serine-threonine ULK1/2 kinase that serves as the catalytic subunit of the ULK complex, ATG101, ATG13, and RB1CC1 (46, 47). In addition to its crucial roles in bulk autophagy, the ULK complex is also recently proved to mediate the initiation of autophagosome formation in several distinct types of selective autophagy processes, including the CCPG1-mediated ER-phagy (20), P62-mediated aggrephagy (48), and NDP52-mediated xenophagy and mitophagy (44, 45). Intriguingly, during those selective autophagy processes, the relevant autophagy receptor can directly interact with RB1CC1, thereby recruiting the ULK complex to the targeting cargo for the subsequent autophagosome biogenesis (20, 44, 45, 48). Specifically, the autophagy receptors CCPG1 and P62 can directly recognize the C-terminal Claw domain of RB1CC1 mediated by their respective FIP200-binding regions (FIR) (20, 48), and, in contrast, autophagy receptor NDP52 is reported to interact with the second C-terminal coiled-coil region of RB1CC1 (44, 45). Other autophagic proteins including ATG16L1, the NDP52/TBK1-binding NAP1 and SINTBAD, are also reported to interact with RB1CC1 Claw through their FIR regions (45, 49, 50).

34418194,"PqsR-independent quorum-sensing response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 outlier-strain reveals new insights on the PqsE effect on RhlR activity. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium and an opportunistic pathogen that represents an important health hazard. The quorum-sensing response regulates the expression of several virulence factors and involves three regulons: Las, Rhl, and Pqs. The P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 strain, which belongs to the genetically diverse PA7 clade, contains a frame-shift mutation in the pqsR gene that encodes a transcriptional activator necessary for pyocyanin (PYO) synthesis in type strains PAO1 and PA14. Here we characterize the PqsE-dependent production of PYO in strain ATCC 9027. We show that this strain expresses pqsE independently of PqsR and in the absence of quinolone production, and that PqsE promotes the RhlR-dependent production of PYO, yet this production is not strictly dependent on PqsE. In addition, we show that in both strains ATCC 9027 and PAO1, PqsE overexpression causes an increased concentration of RhlR and enhances PYO production but does not affect rhamnolipids (RL) production in the same way. These results suggest that PqsE interaction with RhlR preferentially modifies its ability to activate transcription of genes involved in PYO production and provide new evidence about PqsE-dependent RhlR activation, highlighting the variability of the QS response among different P. aeruginosa clades and strains. HIGHLIGHTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 is able to produce pyocyanin in phosphate limiting conditions, even in the absence of a functional PqsR. This strain does not produce alkyl quinolones like PQS and HHQ, but expresses pqsE. Synthesis of pyocyanin by ATCC 9027 is only partially dependent on pqsE. The overexpression of pqsE in the ATCC 9027 and PAO1 strains causes pyocyanin overproduction. The overexpression of pqsE in these strains causes an increased RhlR concentration without affecting rhlR transcription or translation. Rhamnolipids production is not affected to the same extent as pyocyanin by overexpression of pqsE in these strains.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,5832,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.29775062,0

34439869,"Enthalpy-Entropy Compensation in the Promiscuous Interaction of an Intrinsically Disordered Protein with Homologous Protein Partners. 1. INTRODUCTION. Over the last two decades, it has become increasingly clear that a large fraction (up to 40%) of the human proteome is intrinsically disordered or contains disordered regions of significant length [1,2,3,4]. These intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play important regulatory roles in many biological processes, and they have been intimately linked to a number of human diseases underlining the importance of understanding their conformational properties and interactions at the molecular level. IDPs rely on short sequence segments (linear motifs) to mediate interactions with partner proteins [5,6], and several different binding modes have been identified including the folding-upon-binding mechanism, where the IDP folds into a specific conformation on the surface of the partner protein [7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. It has been suggested that folding-upon-binding results in an overall unfavorable entropic contribution to binding thereby allowing IDPs to achieve specific binding without displaying a concomitantly high binding affinity [14,15]. This would have advantages, for example, in signaling processes where reversible interactions are preferred [16]. However, in some cases, the large unfavorable entropic contribution may be partially or entirely compensated by a large favorable enthalpic contribution upon binding (enthalpy–entropy compensation) [17,18,19], by the pre-formation of secondary structure in the free-state ensemble of the IDP [20,21], and/or by a gain in solvent entropy from the release of water molecules at the binding interface that is usually of hydrophobic character [22,23]. For these reasons, the link between binding specificity and affinity is not straightforward and has to be independently evaluated for each IDP complex. In addition to these thermodynamic considerations, IDPs can be promiscuous in nature i.e., they can interact with different partner proteins, even via the same linear motif [24]. One prominent example is the C-terminal intrinsically disordered domain of the tumor suppressor p53 that folds into different conformations (α-helix, β-sheet or random coil) upon binding to different partners [25]. It is not clear how IDPs achieve this folding into different conformations and, in particular, how this feature is encoded in the primary sequence of the IDP and to what extent the surface properties and the shape of the binding cavity dictate the final bound conformation. To shed light on this, a more direct comparison of promiscuous IDP complexes in terms of structure, interaction kinetics and thermodynamics is necessary. We study the promiscuous interaction of an IDP within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cell signaling pathways. The MAPK pathways are essential components of eukaryotic signal transduction networks that direct appropriate responses to cellular stress [26], and four major MAPK pathways have been identified in mammalian organisms: the two ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) pathways, p38 and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) [27]. Docking site motifs play crucial roles in mediating signaling specificity in these pathways [28,29]. They are composed of two to three basic residues (arginine or lysine) and three hydrophobic residues (typically valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, methionine or phenylalanine) according to the following consensus sequence: K/R1–5–X1–6–ΦL–X1–3–ΦA–X–ΦB (where X is any amino acid type, and Φ indicates a hydrophobic residue) [30]. Docking site motifs are embedded within intrinsically disordered regions of MAPK activators (MKKs), deactivators (phosphatases), substrates and scaffold proteins and bind selectively to one of the three MAPKs (JNK, p38 or ERK) to ensure high fidelity in signal transduction. Thus, for example, all seven human MKKs have N-terminal intrinsically disordered regulatory domains containing docking site motifs that selectively recruit JNK, p38 or ERK leading to specific activation (phosphorylation) of the MAPK by the MKK. One exception is MKK4 that contains an 86-amino acid disordered domain with a docking site motif that can recruit both the JNK and p38 kinases. This makes MKK4 the only MKK that activates two different MAPK pathways [31,32]. This naturally poses the question of how the docking site motif of MKK4 has evolved to become promiscuous in nature, while other docking site motifs show clear selectivity between the p38 and JNK pathways [33]. Here we show, using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), that the promiscuous interaction of the disordered regulatory domain of MKK4 with p38α and JNK1 is facilitated by folding-upon-binding into two different conformations, despite the high sequence conservation and structural homology between the two kinases. Our results support a model whereby the specific surface properties of the two kinases dictate the bound conformation of MKK4 and that enthalpy–entropy compensation plays a major role in maintaining comparable binding affinities for MKK4 towards p38α and JNK1. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 2.1. SAMPLE PREPARATION. The regulatory domain of MKK4 (residues 12–86 of human MKK4, Uniprot P45985, hereafter named MKK4), the JNK1 kinase (residues 1–364 of human JNK1 (isoform α1) with a C-terminal 6xHis tag, Uniprot P45983) and the p38α kinase (residues 1–360 of human p38α, Uniprot Q16539) were expressed and purified as described previously [34,35]. The regulatory domain of MKK4 was either 15N-labeled (for NMR) or unlabeled (for ITC). 2.2. ITC EXPERIMENTS.

Injections of 1.5 μL were carried out every 180 s, 26 in total at a stirring speed of 800 rpm. Prior to the experiments, any impurities or aggregates of MKK4 and JNK1 were removed by size-exclusion chromatography in the ITC buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8.2, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.5 mM TCEP).

BACKGROUND The Venovo venous stent (BD/Bard Peripheral Vascular) is indicated to treat iliofemoral veno-occlusive disease. We present our own experience with the Venovo venous stent in treating iliac vein compression (ILVC). METHODS In this retrospective cohort, we included consecutive patients treated with the Venovo venous stent for ILVC at our center. Stent deployment and sizing were guided by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Minimal luminal areas at the compression before and after treatment were measured by IVUS. Clinical improvement was determined by symptoms reported by patients and the Clinical Etiologic Anatomic and Pathophysiologic (CEAP) score. The primary safety endpoint was freedom from acute venothromboembolic disease, stent migration, perforation, acute/subacute closure, and vascular complications. The primary safety endpoint was target-lesion revascularization at 1 year. RESULTS A total of 50 consecutive patients (57 Venovo stents, 36 women, mean age, 59.8 ± 16.3 years) were included. IVUS-measured mean percent stenosis at the compression site was 64.8% ± 12.8%. Mean total stent length and diameter were 78.0 ± 54.0 mm and 17.1 ± 1.9 mm, respectively. The primary safety endpoint was met in all subjects. Procedural technical success was 100% (successful deployment with no complications). At 1 year, 83.8% of patients reported improvement in their symptoms. Freedom from total occlusion at 1 year was 100% (data available for n = 30 patients). Target-lesion revascularization (TLR) was 2% at 1 year due to 1 patient who had stent explantation from worsening ipsilateral left leg and back pain.

34480254,"Acute hospitalization in a cohort of patients with systemic sclerosis: a 10-year retrospective cohort study. INTRODUCTION. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is associated with significantly high morbidity and mortality rates. Most studies in SSc have analyzed disease complications and survival in outpatient cohorts [1–3]. There are very few reports [4–6] evaluating acute hospitalization patterns of SSc cohorts, other than in intensive care units [7, 8], or related to specific complications of SSc, namely pulmonary hypertension and interstitial lung disease [9, 10]. Moreover, most of these studies are from more than a decade ago [11–14], and as such, they do not reflect the impact on survival of SSc patients of recent advances in the management and treatment of different aspects of this disease [15]. Our aim was to analyze the causes and predictors of acute hospitalizations and inpatient mortality, in a cohort of SSc patients. METHODS. We performed a retrospective review of all the 95 patients with SSc fulfilling the 2013 EULAR/ACR Classification Criteria followed in our Unit between January 2011 and December 2020. The total number of SSc patients registered in our hospital, in this time-period, was 123. Only acute admissions, i.e. hospitalizations due to unexpected conditions needing of urgent treatment, were considered. Our Unit has a specific clinic for SSc patients, integrated in an Internal Medicine department with a dedicated ward and direct access to the emergency department and intensive care unit. All acute hospitalizations were considered, even if they occurred outside our institution. Patient’s records due to elective admissions (programmed treatment administration, or needing of a specific complementary diagnostic test, for example) were excluded from this analysis. Clinical data were collected from the patients’ medical files of our Unit and from the National Healthcare Registry Platform. The patients’ characteristics analyzed were as following: age at SSc diagnosis, gender, race, duration of SSc (from the first non-Raynaud’s phenomenon symptom)), skin disease subtype, autoantibodies, prevalence of Raynaud’s phenomenon and organ involvement, including digital ulcers (DU), calcinosis, musculoskeletal symptoms, gastrointestinal involvement, interstitial lung disease (ILD), pulmonary hypertension (PH), cardiac involvement [left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic dysfunction and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction based on the last transthoracic echocardiogram available] and SSc-associated renal crisis. Immunosuppressive therapy, comorbidities, death, and cause of death were also reviewed. For patients who add at least one acute hospital admission further variables were collected was as following: age at the first admission, duration of SSc at first admission, cause of hospitalization, number of acute admissions for each patient, length of stay of each admission and type of department where the patients were admitted. This study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of our institutional research ethics committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Categorical data were presented as counts and percentages. Between-group comparisons of baseline covariates were performed with the Chi square test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Normality of the continuous data was tested with Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The skewed distributions were described with medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) and were compared with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Kruskal–Wallis test. Normal distributions were described with means and standard deviations and were compared with the use of student’s t test. The two-sided alpha level was set at 0.05. Since patients could have more than one admission, we assessed the effect of time until discharge (length of stay) longitudinally with multivariable generalized estimating equations to logistic regression analysis with repeated measures. This allowed for analysis with multiple admissions per patient correcting for the characteristics of a single individual over time. We used multivariable logistic and regression models for the primary analysis to determine possible associations with the development of hospital admission, and infection and mortality during the hospital stay. Variables were entered into the models when the alpha level of the risk factor was less than 0.10 in univariable analysis and if they were clinically relevant. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. We evaluated mortality in our cohort with a survival analysis using Cox proportional hazard regression models for univariable and multivariable analysis and to determine the hazard ratios (HR) and 95%CI. The proportional hazard assumption was evaluated by plotting Schoenfeld residuals as a function of time. Furthermore, we tested the assumption of proportionality by using generalised linear regression of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals on functions of time to test for a non-zero slope. Prediction models for multivariable analysis were developed with a stepwise selection. Variables entered the models when the alpha level of the risk factor was less than 0.10 in univariable analysis and if they were clinically relevant. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Analyses were conducted using STATA software, version 14.0 (StataCorp®). RESULTS. Of the 95 patients included in this cohort analysis, 53 (56%) patients needed acute hospitalization in a total number of 164 admissions. Most of the admissions were in a medical department (73.2%), and during the stay, 6.8% needed admission in the ICU (Table 1). The most frequent causes were infectious diseases in 27% (70% of them were pneumoniae), cardiac diseases in 16.5% (heart failure in 55.6%), peripheral vascular disease in 12.8% (all due to DU and Raynaud’s phenomenon, needing intravenous iloprost) and pulmonary hypertension in 9.8%.

BoNT-A: Botulinum Neurotoxin -A SNAP-25 Synaptosomal-Associated Protein VAMP Vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 SNARE Soluble N-ethylmaleimide Sensitive Factor Attachment Protein Receptor. 1. INTRODUCTION. Pain is a common experience that has profound societal effects, with a greater prevalence in women that increases with age (Johannes et al., 2010). Orofacial pain (OFP) is extremely debilitating and refers to pain associated with the hard and soft tissues of the head, face, and neck (Groenewegen e Uylings, 2000), affecting about 26% of the population (Macfarlane et al., 2002). Anamnesis should be detailed, individualized, and comprehensive. Usually, the clinical approach is multidisciplinary, proportional to the degree and level of involvement and chronification, always starting from less to more invasive interventions. The treatment for OFP conditions is a significant issue and a challenge for the health care services and pharmaceutical industry. Ruling out the possibility of toothache, management of OFP consists of stabilizing plaque, pharmacotherapy, physiotherapy, in addition to thermotherapy, laser, needling, or anesthetic trigger point infiltration are recommended and efficient (Groenewegen e Uylings, 2000). However, some individuals are resistant and/or refractory to conventional approaches, motivating research in search of new therapeutic options, including the use of botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) (Chaurand et al., 2017; Schwartz e Freund, 2002; Scott et al., 2009; Sim, 2011). Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, and there are seven (A – G) serotypes of botulinum toxin (Patil et al., 2016). The BoNT-A, initially intended to treat hyperactive movement disorders such as dystonia and blepharospasms, also demonstrated being effective to reduce dystonia-related pain and emerged as an alternative to treat chronic pain states as neuropathic pain, joint pain, back pain myofascial pain syndromes, migraine, and other headache types (Aoki, 2003; Dodick et al., 2010; Jankovic, 2018; Safarpour e Jabbari, 2018). The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of BoNT-A and BoNT-B for treatment in a variety of clinical and cosmetical conditions (Brin et al., 1989; Carruthers et al., 2002). In 2011, through the PREMPT protocol, the BoNT-A onabotulinum toxin A from Botox® (Allergan, Irvine, CA, USA), has been approved as a treatment for chronic migraine (Dodick et al., 2010). However, besides Botox®, at present, there are other BoNT-A products available worldwide as Botulift® (Medytox, Cheongwon, South Korea), Xeomin® (Merz Pharmaceuticals, Frankfurt, Germany), Dysport® (Ipsen, Paris, France), and Prosigne® (Lanzou Institute of Biological Products, Gansu, China), and their application for orofacial pain relieve has not yet been described. Despite differences among these formulations, the therapeutic effects are believed to be addressed to the presence of the 150 kDa BoNT-A neurotoxin, released by the C. botulinum as a large complex with 900 kDa, consisting in accessory proteins, which are non-toxic non-hemagglutinin plus three hemagglutinins proteins, and a 150 kDa neurotoxin (Aoki et al., 2006; Dressler et al., 2018). This neurotoxin has a heavy (100 kDa) and light (50 kDa) chain. In the site of injection, the heavy chain (100 kDa) of BoNT-A seems to bind to acceptors consisting of gangliosides and synaptic vesicle 2 (SV2A-C) protein isoform and enters the neuron (Muraro et al., 2009). At the cytosol, the light chain (50 kDa) cleaves nine amino acids from SNAP-25 forming SNAP-25 (1–197). SNAP-25 (1–197) reacts with syntaxin, and VAMP-2/synaptobrevin and forms a SNARE complex, which competes with the normal SNARE complex, blocking the neurotransmitter release at the vesicular site (Matak et al., 2019; Pirazzini et al., 2017). For pain relief, some mechanisms have been proposed like the blockage of neurotransmitters release as acetylcholine (Pirazzini et al., 2017), glutamate (Da Silva et al., 2014), substance P (Chien et al., 2012; Purkiss et al., 2000), Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) (Coelho et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2011), serotonin (Ibragić et al., 2016), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and enkephalin (McMahon et al., 1992), noradrenaline and dopamine (Ashton e Dolly, 1988), and glycine (Bigalke et al., 1981), all of them regulated by different targets as the activation of nociceptive receptors or SNARE modulation, for example. Each of these BoNT-A formulations has a unique manufacturing process and contains different excipients (Pickett, 2014), and may be effective to treat different disorders (Baker e Nolan, 2017; Von Lindern et al., 2003). Thus, this study aimed to evaluate different BoNT-A commercially available formulations as possible analgesics in the treatment of an orofacial animal model of pain in mice. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 2.1. ANIMALS. A total of 92 male C57/BL6 mice (20–25 g) were used in the experiments and were obtained from the Rodent Vivarium Network (REBIR) of the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU). The animals were housed in cages at 22 °C with a 12:12 h light/dark cycle, with free access to food and water, and environmental enrichment. The animals were used only once. All the animals were euthanized using xylazine and ketamine, followed by cervical dislocation.

The number of animals is indicated for each group on the legend of the figure.

34593993,"Structural basis of microRNA processing by Dicer-like 1. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that inhibit the expression of target genes by directly binding to their mRNAs. In animals, pri-miRNAs are cleaved by Drosha to generate pre-miRNAs, which are subsequently cleaved by Dicer to generate mature miRNAs. Instead of being cleaved by two different enzymes, both cleavages in plants are performed by Dicer-like 1 (DCL1). With a similar domain architecture as human Dicer, it is mysterious how DCL1 recognizes pri-miRNAs and performs two cleavages sequentially. Here, we report the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of Arabidopsis DCL1 complexed with a pri-miRNA and a pre-miRNA, respectively, in cleavage-competent states. These structures uncover the plasticity of the PAZ domain, which is critical for the recognition of both pri-miRNA and pre-miRNA. These structures suggest that the helicase module serves as an engine that transfers the substrate between two sequential cleavage events.

34652465,"Palliative care interventions in intensive care unit patients. PURPOSE The integration of palliative care into intensive care units (ICUs) is advocated to mitigate physical and psychological burdens for patients and their families, and to improve end-of-life care. The most efficacious palliative care interventions, the optimal model of their delivery and the most appropriate outcome measures in ICU are not clear. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of randomised clinical trials and observational studies to evaluate the number and types of palliative care interventions implemented within the ICU setting, to assess their impact on ICU practice and to evaluate differences in palliative care approaches across different countries. RESULTS Fifty-eight full articles were identified, including 9 randomised trials and 49 cohort studies; all but 4 were conducted within North America. Interventions were categorised into five themes: communication (14, 24.6%), ethics consultations (5, 8.8%), educational (18, 31.6%), involvement of a palliative care team (28, 49.1%) and advance care planning or goals-of-care discussions (7, 12.3%). Thirty studies (51.7%) proposed an integrative model, whilst 28 (48.3%) reported a consultative one. The most frequently reported outcomes were ICU or hospital length of stay (33/55, 60%), limitation of life-sustaining treatment decisions (22/55, 40%) and mortality (15/55, 27.2%). Quantitative assessment of pooled data was not performed due to heterogeneity in interventions and outcomes between studies. CONCLUSION Beneficial effects on the most common outcomes were associated with strategies to enhance palliative care involvement, either with an integrative or a consultative approach. Few studies reported functional outcomes for ICU patients. Almost all studies were from North America, limiting the generalisability to other healthcare systems.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,5875,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0028393746,0
34676472,"Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of CheY influences gene expressions of ABC transports and metabolism in Haemophilus parasuis. Haemophilus (Glaesserella) parasuis is a commensal bacterium that causes Glässer's disease (GD) in swine. As a global transcriptional factor, CheY regulates the expression of hundreds of genes in H. parasuis. In this study, we measured changes in gene expression at the whole transcriptome level using RNAseq. We identified 2058 co-expressed genes, and found 624 differentially expressed genes (q < 0.05) in ΔcheY and SC1401. Several important GO annotations and signaling pathways were identified. RNA-seq results were assembled according to the reference genome, compared with the annotated gene model, and 12 new transcriptional regions were found. Finally, q-PCR results validated the RNA-seq results with 8 randomly selected genes. The present study indicated that CheY is mainly involved in the regulation of ABC transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and β-Lactam resistance.

34702826,"Structural basis for protein glutamylation by the Legionella pseudokinase SidJ. INTRODUCTION. Protein ubiquitination is a fundamental posttranslational modification process that regulates a host of cellular processes including protein turnover, DNA repair, vesicular transport, innate immunity, and cell cycle. Pathogenic bacteria do not possess any ubiquitin (Ub) system of their own, but often secrete effector proteins that hijack the host Ub pathways to evade host defense mechanisms and facilitate intracellular replication of bacteria. LP secretes nearly 300 effector proteins into the host cytosol during infection, targeting a multitude of host pathways often by employing atypical biochemical activities. The SidE family of Legionella effectors carry out noncanonical ubiquitination to target multiple endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane resident proteins, trigger ER fragmentation, and recruit the ER-derived vesicles to the Legionella containing vacuole (LCV). SidE enzymes catalyze Ub transfer to substrate serines without the need of cellular E1 and E2 enzymes. SidEs, however, need multiple steps to catalyze this noncanonical ubiquitination. In the first step, the mART domain in SidEs ADPribosylates Arg42 of Ub using NAD+ as a cofactor. Subsequently, the PDE domain uses ADPribosylated Ub as a substrate and performs a histidine intermediate-driven phosphoryl transfer reaction, resulting in phosphoribosyl (PR) ubiquitination of target serine residues. A recent report found that SidEs can also transfer ubiquitin to substrate tyrosine residues through phosphoribosyl link. SidEs, including the most studied member of the family SdeA, are also deemed toxic to eukaryotic cells due to the phosphoribosylation of Ub activity which renders the canonical host Ub system inactive. A systematic study using yeast toxicity analysis has revealed that LP possesses at least 14 of the so-called metaeffectors which regulate the activity of some of Legionella’s own toxic effector proteins. SidJ is one such metaeffector of LP that represses the toxicity of the SidE family and effectively rescues SidE family-induced lethality in yeast. Interestingly, deletion of SidJ shows a more pronounced growth phenotype compared to deletion of SidEs in Legionella infection experiments conducted in amoeba and macrophages. During the infection, SidEs first get secreted into the cytoplasm, where they ubiquitinate several ER-resident proteins and exert their toxicity. Levels of SidEs in the host cytoplasm peak 30 minutes post-infection, and diminish thereafter in a SidJ-dependent manner. SidJ deletion, therefore, results in a marked Legionella intracellular growth phenotype, presumably due to persistent, uncurbed toxicity of SidEs in the host cytoplasm in the absence of SidJ. Although the deubiquitination (DUB) activity of SidJ remains uncorroborated, recent studies have shown that LP contains two effectors DupA and DupB, which act as bona fide DUBs for PR ubiquitination. More recently, we and other groups have independently shown that SidJ catalyzes ATP-dependent glutamylation of SdeA catalytic residues Glu860 and Glu862, thereby inhibiting ADP-ribosylation of Ub, and hence PR ubiquitination. The glutamylation activity of SidJ is strictly dependent upon the host protein Calmodulin (CaM), which binds to SidJ with nanomolar affinity. Structural studies of SidJ in complex with CaM have revealed that SidJ contains a kinase-like domain (KD) consisting of equivalent N and C-lobes sandwiching a canonical ATP-binding pocket. CaM binds to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of SidJ, and stabilizes the canonical pocket allosterically. Intriguingly, SidJ was also revealed to contain a noncanonical, migrated nucleotide-binding pocket within the C-lobe of the KD. Mutagenesis of residues lining both the canonical pocket and the migrated pocket resulted in the loss of SidJ’s glutamylation activity, indicating both nucleotide-binding pockets play an important role in catalysis. It has been suggested that SidJ-mediated glutamylation occurs through a two-step mechanism: in the first step, SidJ adenylylates (attachment of AMP) SdeA, forming a transient intermediate; in the second step, free l-glutamate launches a SidJ-enabled nucleophilic attack, leading to glutamylation and causing AMP release. But the basis for the specificity of SidJ towards SidE enzymes, and the precise roles of the two nucleotide-binding pockets in coordinating the catalysis remain unknown. Black et al. have hypothesized that the canonical pocket of SidJ is responsible for carrying out initial ATP hydrolysis, coupled to the adenylylation of Glu860 of SdeA, whereas the migrated pocket is suggested to be responsible for the glutamylation reaction. However, Sulpizio et al. have found that mutating residues in the migrated pocket also disrupted the adenylylation of Glu860 of SdeA, and argued that the migrated pocket could be an allosteric nucleotide-binding site necessary to stabilize the canonical pocket, which executes both adenylation and glutamylation reactions. Here, we trapped the pre-glutamylation reaction intermediate of the SidJ/CaM-SdeA complex for structural studies by introducing a single point mutation in SidJ. We purified a stable complex of adenylylated SdeA bound to SidJ, and using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined a 2.9 Å structure of this complex. The structure reveals that the adenylylated E860 residue of SdeA is inserted into the migrated pocket of SidJ, and is poised for glutamylation. We have also determined the post-catalytic state structure of SidJ/CaM and SdeA, in which we captured apo-SidJ bound to glutamylated SdeA, likely poised for the next adenylylation and glutamyl chain extension reactions. Both PDE and mART domains of SdeA interact with SidJ, explaining why a truncation in the PDE rendered SdeA resistant to SidJ in previous yeast toxicity rescue experiments. Our structure-based mutational analysis revealed that SidJ, despite adopting a pseudokinase fold, uses its noncanonical migrated pocket for glutamylation of its",PMC,pos,1,pos,5889,pos_PMC,0.9962419,1
34751649,"Structural insight into the dual function of LbpB in mediating Neisserial pathogenesis. INTRODUCTION. There are 17 species of Neisseria that colonize humans with only two being pathogenic, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae (Seifert, 2019; Tone Tønjum, 2017). N. meningitidis asymptomatically colonizes ~10% of the world’s population, however, once pathogenic can lead to meningitidis and sepsis and lead to high fatality rates in the absence of immediate treatment (Caugant and Brynildsrud, 2020; Read, 2019; Siddiqui et al., 2021). N. gonorrhoeae causes the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhoea (Boyajian et al., 2016). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have categorized N. gonorrhoeae as an urgent threat to public health, which requires immediate and aggressive actions to combat the emerging antibiotic-resistant strains recently discovered (Aitolo et al., 2021; Prevention (CDC), 2011). Although vaccines are now available against all pathogenic serogroups of N. meningitidis, there are well-documented drawbacks and limitations of these vaccines (Deasy and Read, 2011; Pizza et al., 2020). And despite decades of research, there is still no vaccine against gonococcal infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new and improved therapeutics for protection against these human pathogens, particularly against N. gonorrhoeae. Acquisition of nutrients is an essential step during Neisserial pathogenesis (Stork et al., 2013; Zackular et al., 2015). Iron is an essential nutrient for survival, growth, and virulence (Grifantini et al., 2003). Given that free iron is essentially non-existent in the human host, Neisseria have evolved specialized surface receptors to hijack iron from host iron-binding proteins such as transferrin (Tf) and lactoferrin (Lf) (Lee and Schryvers, 1988; Schryvers and Lee, 1989; Schryvers and Morris, 1988; Yadav et al., 2019). One of the more well-studied metal acquisition systems in Neisseria is the transferrin-binding protein (Tbp) system, which consists of an a TonB-dependent transporter called TbpA and a lipoprotein co-receptor called TbpB (Cornelissen et al., 1992; Irwin et al., 1993; Noinaj et al., 2012a; Noinaj et al., 2012b; Noinaj et al., 2010; Pintor et al., 1998). Here, TbpB serves to capture and deliver iron-loaded Tf to TbpA for iron extraction and import across the outer membrane in a process that requires energy from the Ton complex at the inner membrane (Cornelissen et al., 1992; Cornelissen and Hollander, 2011; Noinaj et al., 2010). A second analogous system is called the lactoferrin-binding protein (Lbp) system, which is composed of LbpA and LbpB, targets Lf as an iron source (Figure 1A; Biswas and Sparling, 1995; Gray-Owen and Schryvers, 1996; Lee and Schryvers, 1988; Noinaj et al., 2013; Schryvers et al., 1998; Schryvers and Morris, 1988). However, less is known structurally and functionally about the Lbp system as no structures of Lbp proteins in complex with Lf have been reported. While all strains of N. meningitidis contain a functional Lbp system, it is only observed in roughly half of the N. gonorrhoeae strains (Anderson et al., 2003; Biswas et al., 1999). Studies hint that the Lbp system may serve as a backup option to the Tbp system to assist in mediating pathogenesis within diverse host environments, as a Neisserial strain lacking the Tbp proteins were still able to use the Lbp proteins to cause infection (Anderson et al., 2003). Further, it was also shown that a strain expressing both systems was more competitive than a strain expressing just the Tbp system alone (Anderson et al., 2003). Moreover, anti-sera raised against the Lbp proteins displays bactericidal activity, exemplifying the promise of this system as a target for therapeutic intervention (Pettersson et al., 2006). Given its sequence homology to TbpB, LbpB is predicted to have a similar domain organization consisting of an N- and C-lobes, with each lobe composed of an eight-stranded β-barrel sitting adjacent to a handle domain (Beddek and Schryvers, 2010; Brooks et al., 2014; Ekins et al., 2004; Lee and Schryvers, 1988; Noinaj et al., 2013; Ostan et al., 2017; Schryvers and Lee, 1989). This was partially confirmed when the structure of the N-lobe of LbpB was reported, showing conservation with the N-lobe of TbpB (Brooks et al., 2014). However, reports have varied on the mode of interaction between LbpB and Lf. Docking studies predicted that N-lobe of Lf interacts with LbpB (Arutyunova et al., 2012; Brooks et al., 2014), while hydrogen-deuterium exchange studies, combined with site-directed mutagenesis, showed that the C-lobe of Lf interacts with LbpB (Ostan et al., 2017). Homology modelling studies predicted that binding would align with that observed in TbpB–Tf (Noinaj et al., 2013), however, no structure of LbpB in complex with Lf has been reported. In addition to its role in iron acquisition, LbpB has been shown to provide protection against the host cationic antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin (Lfcn), an 11-residue metabolized fragment from the N-lobe of Lf (Figure 1A; Morgenthau et al., 2014a; Morgenthau et al., 2012; Morgenthau et al., 2014b). Studies have been conflicting on exactly where LbpB interacts with Lfcn to neutralize this threat. One model proposes that it binds along the N-lobe (Brooks et al., 2014), while another model points to several anionic regions along the C-lobe (Morgenthau et al., 2014a; Morgenthau et al., 2014b). In addition to protecting the surface of Neisseria directly, LbpB has been shown to also be proteolytically cleaved by NalP, which enables it to diffuse into the host environment to pre-emptively neutralize Lfcn (Roussel-Jazédé et al., 2010). This additional role for LbpB serving as an antimicrobial peptide sink during Neisserial pathogenesis, in conjunction with its absence in many Neisserial strains despite LbpA being present, has cast some doubt onto its importance in iron import (Morgenthau et al., 2014a). To further characterize the role of LbpB in Neisserial pathogenesis, here we report the cr",PMC,pos,1,pos,5894,pos_PMC,0.99420255,1
34764280,"Cryo-EM structure provides insights into the dimer arrangement of the O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase OGT. INTRODUCTION. The modification of hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine residues of proteins with O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is implicated in transcription, translation, signalling, proteasomal degradation and cell homeostasis. Incorrect patterns of O-GlcNAcylation are linked to neurodegeneration and cancers. Remarkably, OGT is the sole enzyme modifying thousands of proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria. The O-linked GlcNAc is not elongated to form longer, complex glycans and instead cycles on and off the polypeptide target, more akin to phosphorylation than classical glycosylation. Indeed, it is suspected crosstalk occurs between phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation. Beyond glycosylation, OGT cleaves Host Cell Factor 1 (HCF-1) and functions as an interaction partner in large multi-protein complexes. OGT is composed of an N-terminal region comprising 13.5 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) units and a C-terminal multi-domain catalytic region. The catalytic region alone can glycosylate short peptide targets, however, the TPRs are necessary for modification of full-length proteins, promoting peptide cleavage, and engaging in protein-protein interactions. Underscoring their importance, detrimental mutations in the TPR region are linked to X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). XLID is characterised by an inability to understand complex ideas and having limitations in adaptive behaviour, which start before adulthood. Understanding the full-length structure of OGT, and how it interacts with target proteins is a major goal toward ultimately illuminating how OGT engages in protein complexes and selects its protein substrates. In addition, identifying how full-length OGT assembles may provide insights into how mutations contribute to disease. Difficulties in obtaining a full-length structure of OGT, however, has led to structural insights derived from only truncated proteins, initially a dimeric 11.5 TPR-only construct (TPR 1–11.5) and more recently the catalytic domains appended to TPR10-13.5 (Fig. 1a, b). The former demonstrated the TPR region generates an elongated superhelix with an internal groove lined by an asparagine ladder. These asparagine residues are involved in the selection and binding of OGT substrates by making bidentate hydrogen bonds with the peptide backbone. Recent work has also demonstrated aspartate residues which line the TPR lumen which are involved in peptide selection. Originally OGT was proposed to form a trimer in solution, but the crystal structure of the TPR 11.5 construct suggested OGT dimerised around an interface formed at TPR 6-7. This structural observation was supported by size-exclusion chromatography analysis, wherein disruptive mutation of residues lining the dimer interface reduced the size of the TPR 11.5 construct by roughly half. Mutating these same residues in the full-length protein led to a modest decrease of in vitro activity. This reduction in activity suggests the dimer arrangement to be important either for protein stability or supporting catalysis in the full-length structure. Since the current full-length model of OGT is a composite of two independently-solved structures, in this work we determine the structure by cryo-EM of full-length unliganded OGT to assess how the catalytic section is oriented with respect to the full 13.5 unit TPR region. Further, we provide an accurate understanding of the multimeric arrangement of OGT, which should aid in exploring how it complexes with large multi-protein partners. RESULTS. STRUCTURE OF FULL-LENGTH OGT. Through iterative cycles of particle classification in Relion we were able to resolve substantial heterogeneity in the particles and determine a 5.3 Å cryo-EM map (Supplementary Figs. 1–3). Into this map we could readily dock two copies of the X-ray structures of the catalytic region and most of the TPR 11.5 section (Fig. 1c, d). We find that OGT, in agreement with the 11.5 TPR-only crystal structure, forms a dimer supported by a relatively small interface (~560 Å2), which buries <1% of the total surface area of the full-length protein (Fig. 1). Early maps generated during data processing provided density into which only the catalytic domain appended to TPR units 6-13.5 could be modelled, TPR units N-terminal of the dimer interface (TPRs 1–5) exhibited high heterogeneity, suggestive of flexibility in the TPR units of this region. Inspired by the work focussed on resolving structural heterogeneity in the catalytic domain of human γ-secretase, we attempted to capture some of the conformational states adopted by the N-terminal TPR units by careful classification of particles. To search the volume around the missing N-terminal TPR repeats, a density map was created using molmap in Chimera from the atomic coordinates of the 11.5 TPR units crystal structure, which had been fitted into our map and localised to the poorly resolved N-terminal region. This density map was used to create a mask (binary map extension of 3 pixels and a soft edge of 12 pixels) through Relion to search a large volume where the TPRs domains might be found (Supplementary Fig. 3). The generated mask was used to subtract signal from the regions of OGT already modelled using the Relion particle subtraction program. This allowed us to perform careful clustering of the particles to identify TPR conformations within the masked section. Interestingly, we captured only one dominant conformation for this TPR region into which we could further model TPRs 3-5 for one chain of the dimer (Fig. 1e). We note that although the TPRs are flexible in this region, which may relate to their function, the dominant state we observed generally aligns well with the previous TPR 11.5 units crystal structure chain A (RMSD of 1.40 Å, residues 79–399). CONFIRMING THE DIMERIC STATE. Previously the dimeric state of OGT has only been inferred from size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using the 11.5 TPR construct.

34982960,"Comprehensive structure and functional adaptations of the yeast nuclear pore complex. SUMMARY. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of macromolecules. Here we provide a structure of the isolated yeast NPC in which the inner ring is resolved by cryo-EM at sub-nanometer resolution to show how flexible connectors tie together different structural and functional layers. These connectors may be targets for phosphorylation and regulated disassembly in cells with an open mitosis. Moreover, some nucleoporin pairs and transport factors have similar interaction motifs, which suggests an evolutionary and mechanistic link between assembly and transport. We provide evidence for three major NPC variants that may foreshadow functional specializations at the nuclear periphery. Cryo-electron tomography extended these studies, providing a model of the in situ NPC with a radially expanded inner ring. Our comprehensive model reveals features of the nuclear basket and central transporter, suggests a role for the lumenal Pom152 ring in restricting dilation, and highlights structural plasticity that may be required for transport. INTRODUCTION. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are cylindrical assemblies with 8-fold symmetry that form a gateway in the nuclear envelope (NE) for the selective exchange of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and nucleus. These transport machines stabilize a pore in the NE, termed the pore membrane, and are key players in RNA processing and chromatin organization (D’Angelo, 2018; Fernandez-Martinez and Rout, 2021; Kuhn and Capelson, 2019; Ptak et al., 2014). Given this central role, it is not surprising that NPC defects are linked to many diseases and that nuclear transport is a target for therapeutics (Jühlen and Fahrenkrog, 2018; Simon and Rout, 2014). NPCs from the Saccharomyces are smaller (52 MDa) (Kim et al., 2018) than their vertebrate cousins (~109 MDa) (Ori et al., 2013); however, both are composed of about 30 conserved nucleoporins (Nups). In the yeast NPC, ~550 Nups in multiple copies are arranged in three coaxial rings: an inner ring (IR) with 8 massive subunits (termed spokes) is flanked by cytoplasmic and nuclear outer rings to form the core scaffold. In addition, a Pom152 ring is anchored to the spokes and extends into the NE lumen (Kim et al., 2018). A cylindrical basket is attached to the nuclear outer ring and together with the Nup82 complex on the cytoplasmic side forms a pipeline for RNA processing and export (Fernandez-Martinez et al., 2016; Gaik et al., 2015). The scaffold provides anchor points for an array of Nups with intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) repeat domains that project inward to form the central transport path (Kim et al., 2018; Yamada et al., 2010); these FG domains provide binding sites for the bidirectional, facilitated diffusion of nuclear transport factors with macromolecular cargos (Knockenhauer and Schwartz, 2016; Paci et al., 2021). Positional maps and molecular models have been generated for NPCs from yeast, humans, amphibians, and algae using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), single particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), X-ray crystallography, and integrative structure determination (Bui et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2018; Kosinski et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2016; Mosalaganti et al., 2018; von Appen et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020). These models have revealed a remarkable structural redundancy and plasticity of the NPC. Thus, the number and composition of the outer rings can vary between species (Bui et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2018; Mosalaganti et al., 2018), and changes in the functional size of the NPC have been observed (Feldherr and Akin, 1994; Mahamid et al., 2016). Moreover, recent 3D maps obtained by cryo-ET of cell cryo-sections from C. reinhardtii, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, and H. sapiens have revealed a large radial expansion of the inner ring (Mosalaganti et al., 2018; Allegretti et al., 2020; Zimmerli et al., 2021; Schuller et al., 2021). Even with these steps forward, our understanding of NPC structure and its role in transport remains incomplete. To address this issue, we determined three-dimensional (3D) structures of isolated and in situ yeast NPCs with radially contracted and expanded inner rings. Our comprehensive model provides insights into the structure, assembly, transport mechanism, and evolution of the NPC. RESULTS. OVERVIEW OF ISOLATED AND IN SITU YEAST NPCS. The large size, flexibility, and dynamic properties of the NPC present a challenge to structural studies; thus, a divide-and-conquer approach is required to determine a comprehensive structure. We used cryo-EM and single particle analysis of isolated NPCs to generate a combined 3D map with the inner ring and double outer ring at 7.6 and 11 Å resolution, respectively (Figure 1A, top; Methods S1; Table S1). Cryogenic, focused ion beam milling of yeast cells, cryo-ET, and subtomogram analysis were then used to provide a 3D map of the in situ NPC at 30–40 Å resolution (Figures 1B [top]; Table S1). These density maps reveal the NPC in two different states and highlight important specimen differences. Notably, the isolated NPC lacks a pore membrane while retaining a lipid-detergent ring, has an hourglass-shaped central transporter, and contains a double outer ring on the nuclear side. In addition, the Nup82 complex and cytoplasmic outer ring are blurred due to detergent extraction (Figure 1A [top]). Conversely, the Nup82-Dynein 2 (Dyn2) complex of the in situ NPC is well resolved, and basket anchors are visualized on the single nuclear outer ring (Figure 1B [top right]). However, the central transporter was not imaged clearly with the limited in situ dataset. Crystal structures and homology models of Nups were docked within composite density maps to create molecular structures of the isolated and in situ NPC (Figures 1A and 1B [bottom]). We found that density for the Nup82 complex can be overlayed after aligning the inner rings of the isolated and in situ NPC to bring these maps into register,",PMC,pos,1,pos,5930,pos_PMC,0.99678373,1
35058356,"Pseudouridine synthase 7 is an opportunistic enzyme that binds and modifies substrates with diverse sequences and structures. SIGNIFICANCE. Pseudouridine is among the most-abundant RNA modifications. We present a framework for conceptualizing how eukaryotic pseudouridine synthases select their substrates. This work reveals the structure of yeast pseudouridine synthase 7 (Pus7) and presents cell-based and biochemical investigations of enzyme binding and activity. We demonstrate that Pus7 interacts promiscuously with RNAs containing UGUAR sequences. Our observations raise the question of why these enzymes only modify <5% of UGUAR sequences in the transcriptome, suggesting that factors beyond inherent enzyme properties—such as protein localization, local RNA structure, and RNA–protein interactions—principally shape Pus7 substrate selection. These findings support a role for Pus7 in providing cells with a mechanism to rapidly alter protein synthesis in response to cellular conditions. Posttranscriptional modifications to the four standard RNA nucleosides increase the structural and functional complexity of RNAs. The C5-glycosidic isomer of uridine, pseudouridine (Ψ), is incorporated into multiple RNA species including transfer RNAs (tRNAs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (Fig. 1A). While Ψ has been studied in the context of noncoding RNAs for decades, the significance of Ψ in mRNAs is less well understood. Like all mRNA modifications, Ψ has the potential to affect every step in the life cycle of an mRNA (1). In line with this idea, mRNA pseudouridylation has been implicated as a regulator of human alternative splicing, yeast protein synthesis, and toxoplasma mRNA metabolism (2–4). Nonetheless, despite its prevalence, how cells select mRNAs for Ψ modification and the impacts of individual mRNA Ψ-sites on biological processes remain to be established. Ψ is installed into RNAs in all organisms by pseudouridine synthases (Pus). This large class of enzymes is categorized into six families: TruA, TruB, RluA, RsuA, TruD, and Pus10 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Despite the observation that many Pus enzymes are not required for cellular viability in nonstressed conditions, wild-type cells outcompete Pus-deficient cells, suggesting that these enzymes confer a fitness advantage (5–7). Consistent with this, Pus proteins markedly enhance cellular fitness under heat shock (8–11). Furthermore, mutations in the human TruA, TruB, and TruD family members (Pus1, Pus4, and Pus7, respectively) are linked to inherited diseases such as mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia and intellectual disabilities (12–15). In addition to their enzymatic roles, there is emerging evidence that some Pus proteins can have alternative functions in the cell—acting as a tRNA folding chaperones or prions (16–18). One of the next horizons for the Pus field will be deconvoluting the contributions of each of the varied Pus activities (noncoding RNA– and mRNA-modifying or nonenzymatic) to gene expression. Bacterial Pus family members have been studied for decades, and their structures, chemical mechanisms, and modes of RNA target selection are well characterized (19, 20). However, it is unclear why some eukaryotic Pus enzymes exhibit an increased substrate scope, modifying hundreds of mRNAs in addition to their traditional noncoding targets (21, 22). The enzymes responsible for catalyzing the bulk of Ψ incorporation into eukaryotic mRNAs are Pus1, Pus4, and Pus7 (23, 24). Recent transcriptome-wide Ψ-mapping and reporter studies indicate that mRNA secondary structure and sequence contribute to substrate selection by human Pus1 and Pus4 (25, 26). Pus7 is distinct from Pus1 and 4, as it shares ∼10% sequence identity with these enzymes and incorporates Ψ into a particularly diverse set of RNAs (tRNA, tRNA fragments, small nuclear RNA [snRNA], rRNA, and mRNA) (23, 24, 27–29). Pus7 has been shown to preferentially incorporate Ψ into UGUAR (U = U converted to Ψ, R = A or G) consensus sequences (23, 24, 28). However, this sequence motif does not explain how Pus7 selects its substrates, because only a limited set (<5%) of the UGUAR sequences present in RNAs are Pus7 targets. To establish the determinants of Pus7 substrate selection, we first solved a crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pus7. Comparing the yeast and human Pus7 structures with their prokaryotic TruD counterparts, we noticed a large eukaryotic-specific insertion (insertion domain I, ID-I) sitting atop the active site in two distinct conformations. Both of the observed conformations for this domain are well positioned to potentially interact with incoming RNA substrates. Our biochemical and cell-based studies of Pus7 enzymes lacking ID-I (Pus7ΔIDI) support this supposition. We also evaluated the impact of RNA sequence and structure on Pus7 substrate binding and modification. Our results indicate that Pus7 preferentially associates with RNAs containing a UGUAR consensus sequence but only minimally discriminates between binding different RNA structures. The enzyme has a greater degree of selectivity during catalysis than binding, with the rate constant and extent of pseudouridylation increasing on RNAs with less predicted-structure both in vitro and in cells. Nonetheless, despite these preferences, Pus7 modifies all of the UGUAR containing substrates that we presented it in vitro. Our observations lead us to propose an opportunistic model for Pus7 substrate selection. In this model, Pus7 rapidly samples RNAs, binding and modifying any UGUAR sequence that it can access for long enough. This model is supported by observations that UGUAR sequences in structured contexts are modified more rapidly and efficiently at elevated temperatures, when RNA structures are destabilized. These findings extend the current framework for thinking about Pus enzymes by proposing that protein compartmentalization, local RNA structure, and RNA–protein interactions are among the most-substantive determinants for Pus7 substrate discrimination.

35077711,"Intricate coupling between the transactivation and basic-leucine zipper domains governs phosphorylation of transcription factor ATF4 by casein kinase 2. The activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), also called cAMP response element-binding protein-2 (CREB-2), is a transcription factor that mediates cellular gene expression changes in response to different types of cellular stress (1, 2, 3). While constitutively expressed at low concentrations, ATF4 can be rapidly induced under particular cell-stress conditions such as endoplasmic reticulum stress (4), amino acid deprivation (5), and oxidative stress (6). ATF4 expression is also found to be upregulated in response to cancer progression, making it an interesting therapeutic target for blocking angiogenesis and adaptation of cancer cells to hypoxia/anoxia (7). Activity of ATF4 as a transcriptional repressor includes repression of genes encoding encephalin, chromogranin (8), and the phosphodiesterase PDE4D9 (9). ATF4 is known to form heterodimers with other transcription factors such as ATF3 (10), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) (11), and HTLV1 transactivator Tax (12). The numerous dimerization and interaction partners of ATF4 determine its wide range of transcriptional activities. ATF4 GENERAL DOMAIN ARCHITECTURE. Human ATF4 is a 351 amino acid long protein organized into two functional domains, an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD, residues 1–275) and a C-terminal basic-leucine zipper domain (bZip, residues 276–351). The C-terminal bZip domain is composed of a basic region essential for DNA binding (residues 280–301) and leucine zipper region (residues 306–334) essential for homo/heterodimerization (Fig. 1A). The bZip domain forms an extended α-helix encompassing both the basic and leucine-zipper regions in a continuous helical structure (13). Like many other transactivation domains in transcription factors, the TAD is predicted to be structurally disordered but plays a key role in modulating the activation and degradation of ATF4 (14). The N-terminal TAD contains a known binding site for several important binding partners, including p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) (1) and βTrCP (14, 15, 16). The TAD is also the target of multiple posttranslational modifications. The primary phosphorylation sites of protein kinase A (PKA) (17), ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) (18), casein kinase 2 (CK2) (19), and RET tyrosine kinase (20), among others, are all known to be localized within the TAD of ATF4. Previous NMR studies have shown that a region of TAD encompassing the β-TrCP-binding motif (amino acids 208–230) is disordered in the unphosphorylated state but adopts a hairpin loop structure upon phosphorylation of serines 219 and 224 (15). This phosphorylation-induced conformational change appears to be critical for formation of the β-TrCP-ATF4 complex (16). However, very little is known about the structural features of the full TAD sequence, as an isolated domain or in the context of the full-length ATF4. Furthermore, the mechanisms of interdomain communication and potential coupling with the bZip domain remain unclear. In the present study, we used a combination of bioinformatic sequence analysis, circular dichroism (CD), analytical size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS), and solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structural features of TAD. We found that the transactivation domain is predominantly disordered in solution with the exception of a short stretch of amino acids with a higher helical propensity at the N-terminus of the TAD. In addition, our results show that the TAD and bZip domains are not structurally independent but are coupled through long-range interactions involving the N-terminal region of the TAD. Finally, we found that the presence of the bZip is required to achieve complete phosphorylation of the TAD by the casein kinase CK2, suggesting that coupling between the TAD and bZip domains is essential for optimal posttranslational modification, a crucial mechanism controlling ATF4 proteasomal turnover. RESULTS. ATF4 SEQUENCE ANALYSIS. We first examined the degree of sequence conservation of ATF4 by comparing the human protein sequence (Uniprot P18848) with those of frog (Xenopus laevis, Uniprot Q3V796), chicken (Gallus gallus, Uniprot Q9W610), bovine (Bos taurus, Uniprot F1MXZ1), goat (Capra hircus, Uniprot A0A452EN02), and mouse (Mus musculus, Uniprot Q06507). These sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega (21). Figure 1B shows the conservation score obtained throughout the sequence and highlights the regions that are highly conserved (score >8 in red) and those that are poorly conserved (score <2 in blue). As expected, the bZip domain, which is essential for DNA binding and dimerization of ATF4, is highly conserved among the compared species (Fig. 1B). In contrast, amino acids of the TAD are generally poorly conserved, especially at C-terminus of the transactivation domain. A few notable exceptions include several residues at the N-terminus of the TAD (residues 18, 39, 85, 87, 90, and 95). Analysis of ATF4 amino acid sequence with IDDomainSpotter (22) reveals that the TAD sequence is predominantly enriched in hydrophilic and disorder promoting amino acids (Pro, Ser, and Thr) and depleted in Arg and Lys (represented by positive +PST-RK scores in Fig. 1C). Yet, the amino acid composition of two short regions at the N-terminal of the TAD (residues 34–47 and 82–98), which contain conserved amino acids, noticeably differs from the rest of the TAD. Indeed, these regions have negative +PST-RK scores, which indicate a lower propensity for structural disorder (Fig. 1C). These differences in amino acid composition within the TAD sequence were confirmed by disorder propensity predictions from DisEMBL (23), PONDR-FIT (24), and DISOPRED (25). Altogether, these predictions show a clear difference in propensity for structural disorder between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the TAD.

35474152,"Backbone and side chain resonance assignment of the intrinsically disordered human DBNDD1 protein. BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT. The dysbindin (dystrobrevin-binding protein) protein family is a group of evolutionarily related proteins of moderate size (Mw 13–45 kDa) in higher Eukaryotes. Their amino acid sequences suggest that they are mainly cytosolic or nuclear proteins partly associating with membranes (Talbot et al. 2009). The human dysbindin protein sub-family consists of the supposed paralogs dysbindin-1 (alternative short names: DTNBP1, BLOC-1 Subunit 8 or HPS7 protein; UniProtKB: Q96EV8), dysbindin-2 (alternative short name: DBNDD2, CK1BP or HSMNP1; UniProtKB: Q9BQY9), and dysbindin-3 (alternative short name: DBNDD1; UniProtKB: Q9H9R9), with each of them expressing various isoforms. In humans this results in at least eight family members (dysbindin-1A, -1B, -1C, -2A, -2B, -2C, -3A, and -3B) currently reported (Talbot et al. 2009). The designated dysbindin paralogs show very limited sequence homology which raised the question whether DBNDD1 and DBNDD2 are dysbindin-like proteins or proteins that share a less conserved domain with DTNBP1 in the context of otherwise unrelated sequences (Ghiani and Dell’Angelica 2011). Human dysbindin domain-containing protein 1 (DBNDD1) is encoded by the gene DBNDD1 at chromosome locus 16q24.3. Currently, three human isoforms produced by alternative splicing are known for DBNDD1 (Bateman et al. 2021). The human DBNDD1 isoforms 1 (UniProtKB: Q9H9R9-1) and 2 (UniProtKB: Q9H9R9-2) differ only in the N-terminal region where 20 amino acids are additional in isoform 2. In contrast, isoform 3 (UniProtKB: Q9H9R9-3) carries a 100 amino acids long N-terminal sequence extension. The canonical human protein DBNDD1 (UniProtKB: Q9H9R9), the focus of our study, is 158 amino acids long with a high content of the acidic residues glutamate and aspartate (13% and 7%, respectively) as well as serine (6%) and threonine (8%). Unlike other dysbindin family proteins, DBNDD1 isoforms are probably non-classical secretory proteins (Talbot et al. 2009). Additionally, it is a proline-rich (10% prolines) cytoplasmatic protein with expression in nearly all organs and e.g., neuronal cells. No expression could be detected in the ovary, the adipose tissue, and the bone marrow [(Uhlen et al. 2015), https://www.proteinatlas.org]. The Pfam database [(Mistry et al. 2021), https://pfam.xfam.org/] predicts human DBNDD1 mainly as an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) and also the recently released AlphaFold database (Jumper et al. 2021; Varadi et al. 2022) predicts human DBNDD1 – with a short stretch of helical propensity between residues L77 and S95 – entirely as an IDP. Interestingly, S95 (beside S119) is one of the two reported phosphorylation sites. Along with S65, S95 is proposed to constitute a casein kinase 1 interaction site while S119 might be modified by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Talbot et al. 2009). We performed a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis to identify regions of local similarity between the human DBNDD1 and protein sequences from other species (Fig. 1). As an outcome human DBNDD1 revealed a high sequence identity to dysbindin domain-containing proteins from other Hominidae (e.g., G. gorilla gorilla and P. paniscus 99% and 97% identity, respectively). Likewise, the proteome of Old and New World monkeys contains DBNDD1-like proteins with sequence identities to human DBNDD1 of approximately 95%. Proteins with high sequence identity to human DBNDD1 can also be found in evolutionarily more distant species (e.g., M. musculus and X. laevis 80% and 61% identity, respectively). The sequence conservation of the putative dysbindin domain across all selected species is notable (Fig. 1 shaded region). Although, a high sequence conservation also suggests a conservation of structure and function, current experimental insights into the structure or function are missing on human DBNDD1 with the exception of some experimental data indicating that the DBNDD1 gene is associated with melanoma risk and that the DBNDD1 level is decreased in Parkinson’s disease mouse models (Auburger et al. 2016; Fang et al. 2020). Also, a negative regulation of protein kinase activity is predicted for DBNDD1. In contrast, its paralog dysbindin-1, the first family member discovered (Benson et al. 2001), is more intensively described. Dysbindin-1 contains a coiled-coil domain, a structural component known to e.g., facilitate biological maintenance, repair, replication, trafficking processes and enzymatic activities (Truebestein and Leonard 2016). Expression of dysbindin-1 is ubiquitous in the body and in virtually all neuronal cells (Talbot et al. 2009). For instance, dysbindin-1 was shown to be involved in neurite extension and synaptic vesicle trafficking (Auburger et al. 2016). Mutations in dysbindin-1 are responsible for the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (Li et al. 2003) and genetic variations of dysbindin-1 are associated with psychiatric conditions like psychosis, bipolar disorder, major depression, and schizophrenia (Straub et al. 2002; Talbot et al. 2009). From the data available for DBNDD1 and its paralogs, it becomes clear that DBNDD1 may be involved in essential cellular processes. Thus, investigation of human DBNDD1 can broaden our understanding of the exact function of this protein and help to explain the previously observed associations with pathological manifestations. METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS. PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. We ordered a synthetic gene coding for full-length human DBNDD1 from Thermo Fischer Scientific (Germany).

However, challenges producing PPxY polypeptides containing the full binding domain has limited understanding of the assembly process.

35625550,"Structural Insights into the Intrinsically Disordered GPCR C-Terminal Region, Major Actor in Arrestin-GPCR Interaction. 1. INTRODUCTION. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins involved in signal transduction. They are central in the cellular response for a wide range of extracellular ligands, such as hormones, nucleotides, lipids, ions, photons, and neurotransmitters [1]. Their signaling outcome regulates a large number of biological functions and, therefore, their dysfunctions are linked to various pathologies [2]. Consequently, GPCRs are the target of a third of the current clinical drugs [3]. Their functional diversity comes from the existence of a large number of GPCRs (~800 members in humans), classified according to their sequence and phylogenetic analyses [4]. While they share a highly conserved core domain (7TM) composed of seven transmembrane helices connected by three extracellular (ECL) and intracellular (ICL) loops, their extracellular N- and intracellular C-termini, as well as the loops, are highly variable in both sequence and length (Figure 1) [5,6]. Upon extracellular ligand binding, GPCR conformational rearrangements allow G protein association and G protein dependent signaling initiation. Besides G proteins, GPCRs can trigger other signaling pathways by interacting with arrestin, i.e., desensitization, internalization, and receptor trafficking [7]. Arrestin interaction requires GPCR C-terminal domain (GPCR-Cter) phosphorylation by specific G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). The current model of GPCR:arrestin interaction, the so-called phospho-barcode model [8,9], states that, upon activation, GPCRs become phosphorylated at specific sites on their C-terminal domain, and this impacts their interaction with arrestin, in turn affecting its conformation and, ultimately, the intracellular signal triggered by arrestin. However, we are just beginning to grasp the mechanistic basis of this mode of functioning as experimental demonstrations are still scarce even for the best-studied GPCRs. GPCR:arrestin complex formation leads to arrestin activation through conformational changes (for a review see [10]). However, putative conformational changes of GPCR-Cter induced by GRK phosphorylation or arrestin binding are still poorly described. These C-terminal regions are predicted to behave as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) [11,12]. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDRs are highly dynamic proteins/regions with a low content of transient secondary structures, which make their structural characterization difficult [13]. Atomic structures of GPCR-arrestin complex revealed that the C-terminus of the vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) and rhodopsin are partially folded on arrestin surface [13,14,15,16]. This suggests a mechanism by which the IDR undergoes conformational changes upon post-translational modification and/or binding to its target [14]. Indeed, IDPs/IDRs most likely contain some pre-formed secondary structure elements that are often involved in the recognition of specific partners and modulate the affinity [15]. In order to better understand how the structural features of the GPCR C-terminal regions could impact on their functional role, we characterized the structure of the truncated C-terminal regions of three GPCRs, namely the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R), the ghrelin receptor type 1a (GHSR) and the β2-adernergic receptor (β2AR) (Figure 1). These three class-A receptors are important therapeutic targets [2] and are representative of the two different classes of arrestin binders [16]. The first class, which includes β2AR and GHSR, forms a transient complex with arrestin that dissociates near the plasma membrane. Thus, arrestin does not internalize with the receptor. In contrast, the second class, which includes V2R, forms a more stable complex allowing the internalization of the whole assembly. Here, we confirmed the disordered nature of these three GPCR-Cters and the presence of transient secondary structures by a set of biophysical tools: circular dichroism (CD), multi angle light scattering (MALS), and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Then, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to probe the conformational and dynamic preferences at residue level, using a set of complementary experiments, such as secondary chemical shifts (SCS), scalar (J) and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) and relaxation [17,18,19,20]. We show that the three C-terminal regions of the chosen GPCRs displayed different transient secondary structures, which could be involved in arrestin binding. These regions could act as short linear motifs (SLiMs), partner recognition IDP segments that are embedded in poorly conserved, disordered regions. By comparison with crystallographic structures of synthetic peptides in interaction with arrestin [21,22,23], our results suggest that structural changes in these putative SLiMs occur either after phosphorylation of the C-terminal region or upon arrestin binding. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 2.1. SAMPLE PREPARATION.

35679397,"AI-based structure prediction empowers integrative structural analysis of human nuclear pores. INTRODUCTION The eukaryotic nucleus pro-tects the genome and is enclosed by the two membranes of the nuclear envelope. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) perforate the nuclear envelope to facilitate nucleocytoplasmic transport. With a molecular weight of ∼120 MDa, the human NPC is one of the larg-est protein complexes. Its ~1000 proteins are taken in multiple copies from a set of about 30 distinct nucleoporins (NUPs). They can be roughly categorized into two classes. Scaf-fold NUPs contain folded domains and form a cylindrical scaffold architecture around a central channel. Intrinsically disordered NUPs line the scaffold and extend into the central channel, where they interact with cargo complexes. The NPC architecture is highly dynamic. It responds to changes in nuclear envelope tension with conforma-tional breathing that manifests in dilation and constriction movements. Elucidating the scaffold architecture, ultimately at atomic resolution, will be important for gaining a more precise understanding of NPC function and dynamics but imposes a substantial chal-lenge for structural biologists. RATIONALE Considerable progress has been made toward this goal by a joint effort in the field. A synergistic combination of complementary approaches has turned out to be critical. In situ structural biology techniques were used to reveal the overall layout of the NPC scaffold that defines the spatial reference for molecular modeling. High-resolution structures of many NUPs were determined in vitro. Proteomic analysis and extensive biochemical work unraveled the interaction network of NUPs. Integra-tive modeling has been used to combine the different types of data, resulting in a rough outline of the NPC scaffold. Previous struc-tural models of the human NPC, however, were patchy and limited in accuracy owing to several challenges: (i) Many of the high-resolution structures of individual NUPs have been solved from distantly related species and, consequently, do not comprehensively cover their human counterparts. (ii) The scaf-fold is interconnected by a set of intrinsically disordered linker NUPs that are not straight-forwardly accessible to common structural biology techniques. (iii) The NPC scaffold intimately embraces the fused inner and outer nuclear membranes in a distinctive topol-ogy and cannot be studied in isolation. (iv) The conformational dynamics of scaffold NUPs limits the resolution achievable in structure determination. RESULTS In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction to generate an exten-sive repertoire of structural models of human NUPs and their subcomplexes. The resulting models cover various domains and interfaces that so far remained structurally uncharac-terized. Benchmarking against previous and unpublished x-ray and cryo-electron micros-copy structures revealed unprecedented accu-racy. We obtained well-resolved cryo-electron tomographic maps of both the constricted and dilated conformational states of the hu-man NPC. Using integrative modeling, we fit-ted the structural models of individual NUPs into the cryo-electron microscopy maps. We explicitly included several linker NUPs and traced their trajectory through the NPC scaf-fold. We elucidated in great detail how mem-brane-associated and transmembrane NUPs are distributed across the fusion topology of both nuclear membranes. The resulting architectural model increases the structural coverage of the human NPC scaffold by about twofold. We extensively validated our model against both earlier and new experimental data. The completeness of our model has enabled microsecond-long coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the NPC scaffold within an explicit membrane en-vironment and solvent. These simulations reveal that the NPC scaffold prevents the constriction of the otherwise stable double-membrane fusion pore to small diameters in the absence of membrane tension. CONCLUSION Our 70-MDa atomically re-solved model covers >90% of the human NPC scaffold. It captures conforma-tional changes that occur during dilation and constriction. It also reveals the precise anchoring sites for intrinsically disordered NUPs, the identification of which is a prerequisite for a complete and dy-namic model of the NPC. Our study exempli-fies how AI-based structure prediction may accelerate the elucidation of subcellular ar-chitecture at atomic resolution.

35682829,"The Disordered EZH2 Loop: Atomic Level Characterization by 1HN- and 1Hα-Detected NMR Approaches, Interaction with the Long Noncoding HOTAIR RNA. 1. INTRODUCTION. Epigenetic regulator proteins play key roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. The enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a part of the gene-regulating polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is responsible for the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27), resulting in the silencing of several genes, including tumor suppressors. This effectively fuels cancer proliferation [1]. Recent scientific evidence has highlighted the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the targeting of the PRC2 complex [2,3]. Amongst the PRC2 subunits, EZH2 shows the highest affinity towards lncRNAs [4,5], although it lacks a well-defined RNA-binding motif [6]. A great variability was observed among the binding partners [7,8], and EZH2 was postulated to be promiscuous for RNAs [9], albeit it can discriminate between different lncRNAs, and its specificity can be fine-tuned in vivo by other factors [4,5,10]. Details of the RNA features that the EZH2 can recognize remain elusive, as many but not all of the interacting RNA partners are reported to fold into secondary structural elements [11,12]. This includes the important binding partner, HOX Transcript Antisense Intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) [13]. This lncRNA plays a crucial role in the recruitment of the PRC2 complex to its target genes [5,14,15]. Two binding motifs, a duplex and a quadruplex structure, were proposed [5], and recent studies have suggested that the G-quadruplex is more likely to interact with the PRC2 [16,17]. Since EZH2 does not contain a canonical RNA-binding element, the location of the RNA-binding site on EZH2 is debated in the literature. Long et al. reported on different key binding residues throughout EZH2, most of which are located in the N-terminal helical region, and they noted that residues from other PRC2 components may be involved in RNA binding as well [18]. Based on literature information, it appears that RNA binding is mediated by a fragmented binding surface formed by different PRC2 subunits and several RNA-recognizing regions within separate proteins [4]. One of the key questions that remains still unanswered is the regulation and specificity of the PRC2-RNA interaction, as PRC2 shows promiscuous RNA binding in vitro [9], yet elicits highly specific reactions to certain RNAs in vivo [19]. An indication of in vivo regulation emerged when it was shown that RNA binding and subsequent PRC2 recruitment is enhanced upon the phosphorylation of Thr345 [13,20]. The reported region, including Thr345, is located at the beginning of a 96-residue-long loop of EZH2 (Figure 1a), which is considered to be disordered, as suggested by the missing electron densities from the X-ray structure of PRC2 [6]. Its presumed disordered nature was further confirmed by the AlphaFold-generated structure [21,22], in which the per-residue confidence score is below 50 for the whole loop region (Figure 1b). Moreover, the disorder prediction programs IUPred3 [23] and ODinPred [24] show a high propensity of the sequence to be unstructured (Figure 1c). Structural effects and the mechanistic background of the effect of phosphorylation has not been offered, and no explanation is given as to how phosphorylation might increase affinity to RNA molecules. RNA-binding intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) have received increasing attention during the previous years, as more and more information surfaces on their abundance and biological relevance [25,26]. While there are well-known disordered RNA-recognition elements, such as the RGG motifs or the serine-rich regions, many identified RNA-binding disordered segments lack these signature characteristics [27]. Scarcity of detailed structural studies of these complexes render the molecular details of the RNA recognition by these IDRs still enigmatic. A closer inspection of the EZH2 loop sequence (Figure 1a) reveals that it does not resemble neither the RGG nor the serine-rich type RNA-binding IDRs. Thus, studying its RNA-binding capabilities not only offers a unique opportunity to understand how a non-canonical, RNA-binding IDR recognizes its cognate partner, but also helps us uncover the structural background of the phosphorylation that may fine-tune protein–RNA recognition. Since disordered proteins are famously recalcitrant to crystallize, NMR spectroscopy is the only method [28] to give an atomic-level characterization. Nevertheless, physiological conditions (pH~7.0, 310 K) may pose challenges for the well-known 1HN-detected approach. Proline residues, which are more abundant in IDPs than in folded proteins [29], and lack HN protons, further complicate assignment strategies, especially if Pro–Pro motifs are present. Moreover, proline cis/trans isomerization might give rise to minor components, and a certain equilibrium is established [30]. In the light of all these, we aimed to understand how the disordered loop of EZH2 recognizes one of its most important RNA partners, HOTAIR, and whether phosphorylation modifies the interaction. To achieve these goals, we performed a detailed atomic-level characterization, and we studied the changes caused by the phosphomimetic mutation and characterized the interaction with the HOTAIR140 (1–140 nt) lncRNA, localizing binding regions on the EZH2 loop. 2. RESULTS. 2.1. COMPARISON OF 1HN AND 1HΑ DETECTED APPROACHES. Under physiological conditions, the performance of the classical 1HN detected method is limited due to the fast chemical exchange of amide protons with water [31]. For the EZH2 loop, the 1H,15N-HSQC measurement at 310 K, pH = 7.2 delivered only ~30% of the expected signals (Figure 2a) due to broadening of several resonances below the detection limit. The problem was solved when working at a lower temperature (278 K), the assignment of ~85% of the peaks was already done. Acidic pH helped further: at pH = 5.1, a 92% assignment was achieved.

However, there are relatively few staff trainers in rural areas and areas outside of the United States, which may make synchronous training difficult or impossible (Gerencser et al., 2019). There is also a relative deficit of trainers compared to the number of staff who require training (Karsten et al., 2015). In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused many service providers to make the transition to telehealth services (Cox et al., 2020), which necessitated the use of more technology-based training procedures. Therefore, synchronous procedures may have limited accessibility for some trainees. Asynchronous training is an alternative procedure that does not require trainers and trainees to be present at the same time. A variety of asynchronous training procedures are available, including video modeling, computer-based instruction (CBI), and self-instruction in the form of manuals or task analyses (e.g., Gerencser et al., 2019; Gutierrez et al., 2019; Tyner & Fienup, 2016). Some asynchronous training procedures involve a combination of training strategies, including using both video models and self-instructional materials. A review of the available literature on asynchronous training strategies found that self-instructional packages are one of the most effective methods for training staff across a wide variety of skills (Marano et al., 2020). The existing literature can serve as a guide for researchers because they can apply the techniques to train other skills that have not yet been evaluated in the published literature. For example, the literature on training graph creation can provide direction for training individuals to perform other skills on a computer. Mitteer et al. (2018) taught behavior technicians to create publication-quality graphs using a video model. A subsequent study also demonstrated that video modeling effectively trained participants to input data and create graphs (Mitteer et al., 2020). Tyner and Fienup (2015) also contributed to this line of research by comparing video modeling and text-based instruction on the creation of multiple-baseline design graphs. Results showed that video modeling was the more effective technique; text-based instruction in the form of a task analysis also improved performance. Berkman et al. (2019) extended the literature by comparing video modeling with voiceover instructions and enhanced written instructions for training graphing skills. Results indicated that both training procedures were effective. These findings suggest that video models, task analyses, or potentially a combination of both may be effective for training computerized skills (i.e., graph creation). Therefore, similar training techniques may be effective for training other skills that are performed on a computer. Despite the efficacy of various training strategies for teaching a range of skills that behavior analysts are required to learn, there are some skills that staff training research has not targeted. For example, equivalence-based instruction (EBI) refers to a teaching procedure designed to increase instructional efficiency by incorporating the principles of stimulus equivalence (Stromer et al., 1992). EBI incorporates the principles of stimulus equivalence by teaching individuals to treat physically disparate stimuli as functionally interchangeable. During EBI, the instructor designs training so that some relations are directly taught (e.g., A goes with B), whereas other derived relations emerge without direct teaching (e.g., B goes with A). This makes EBI an economical and generative procedure because some responses emerge in the absence of direct teaching due to the programmed contingencies inherent to EBI (Brodsky & Fienup, 2018). EBI is important to learn because the procedure can lead to expanded repertoires without direct teaching of all components (e.g., learning less vs. more, learning additional language skills; Cooper et al., 2020). Researchers have effectively used EBI to train a variety of skills to adults of typical development, including statistics (Critchfield & Fienup, 2010), interpreting operant functions (Albright et al., 2016), and portion-size estimation (Vladescu et al., 2020). EBI is a viable strategy for teaching individuals with developmental disabilities because it has the potential to optimize instructional efficiency (Arntzen et al., 2010; Rehfeldt, 2011). Despite the potential benefits of EBI, it does not appear to be widely adopted by clinicians. According to Critchfield et al. (2018), one possible reason EBI is not used is that the majority of EBI research is basic in nature and conducted in laboratory settings targeting skills that are of limited social significance. In addition, the terminology and symbolic notation system used to describe EBI and define equivalence classes may also be unfamiliar to behavior analysts who have limited training in this area. Moreover, the extant EBI literature spans approximately 50 years (originating with Sidman, 1971), which may present a formidable challenge for practitioners to consume in light of numerous competing contingencies. Taken together, these barriers may make it difficult for staff to design EBI procedures themselves, let alone train other staff to use EBI. However, the Behavior Analyst Certification Board’s Fifth Edition Task List (Behavior Analyst Certification Board, 2017) requires that behavior analysts seeking certification can define and provide examples of derived stimulus relations. This makes EBI an ideal skill for researchers to teach as a way of extending the literature on staff training. There is currently no research investigating directly training staff to create or administer EBI. However, Blair a",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,6041,far_neg_PMC,0.0019955388,0
35865780,"Presentation and treatment of aggressive, Triple-Negative carcinosarcoma of the breast. 1. INTRODUCTION. A rare and aggressive tumor, carcinosarcoma is a mixed, dedifferentiated carcinoma consisting of an epithelial, carcinomatous component and a non‐epithelial, mesenchymal component. Distinct from other metaplastic carcinomas, carcinosarcoma is crucially biphasic , , lacking a clearly identifiable transition zone and historically has been known by several names, including biphasic metaplastic carcinoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, and metaplastic sarcomatoid carcinoma. Various organs have been known to be affected by this malignancy, including the skin, breast, bladder, ovaries, lung, larynx, and the uterus, where uterine carcinosarcomas are known as malignant mixed Müllerian tumors. A diagnosis of carcinosarcoma in the breast typically accompanies a poor prognosis because of the tumor's propensity toward lymph, pleural, and pulmonary metastasis. Evidence suggests that the hybrid components of breast carcinosarcoma have a monoclonal origin from an original breast myoepithelial (or its precursor) cell that differentiate in a biphasic manner. , A proteomics study by Djomehri et al. suggests that relative to non‐metaplastic breast carcinomas, breast carcinosarcoma is upregulated in its epithelial–mesenchymal transition pathway and is downregulated in its oxidative phosphorylation pathway. In the breast, carcinosarcoma accounts for less than 0.2–1% of new cases. , , , One oft‐cited study of this malignancy demonstrated a cumulative 5‐year survival rate of 49%, with a precipitous decrease in survival odds at later stages of the disease. Lacking a treatment standard, options for remedying breast carcinosarcoma include surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation, , although recurrence of disease has been known to occur in these approaches toward treatment. 2. CASE REPORT. 56‐year‐old woman presented to the hospital with a palpable mass 12 cm from the nipple. An ultrasound revealed a neoplasm in the upper inner quadrant of the left breast, with a diameter of 2.2 cm (Figure 1A). Having developed within the span of a year, initial impressions of the mass were unremarkable and thought to be benign. EKG results for the patient were similarly unremarkable. The patient reported an unconfirmed medical history of untreated ovarian and cervical cancers, as well as fibroids. Subsequent biopsy and immunohistochemical staining on the breast mass indicated it was a malignancy negative for ER, PR, and HER2, though positive for E‐cadherin and p‐120 catenin. Following a chest X‐ray (Figure 1B), as well as a lumpectomy of the mass and surrounding tissue, the malignancy was diagnosed as a ductal‐type carcinoma, with troubling sarcomatous, squamous, and chondroid elements (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5). The tumor was an irregularly shaped, white‐tan mass of ductal origin with dimensions of 3.0 × 2.3 × 1.7 cm that had become partly necrotic and adjoined to an 8 mm diameter cyst. While the skin overlying the tumor and the marginal tissue surrounding the tumor were benign, positive vimentin staining confirmed that elements of the malignancy were of a mesenchymal origin. Other immunohistochemistry results indicated positive stains of AE‐1, AE‐3, GATA‐3, P63, PD‐L1, and s100, but negative stains of SMA, actin, desmin, factor XIIIa, CD34, CD68, and CD117. The cancer was shown to have greatly metastasized into the left axillary lymph node. The tumor was highly proliferative, with a Ki‐67 expression of 80%. The patient, who has a medical history of anemia, was found to have depleted erythrocyte and hemoglobin levels at the time of treatment, as well as elevated platelet counts. The patient's alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated, which suggested the tumor may have metastasized into the skeletal system and caused lesions. This possibility was ruled out following PET/CT and bone scans. 3. DISCUSSION. The carcinosarcoma exhibited by the patient falls into a larger umbrella category of metaplastic breast carcinomas (MpBCs), a rare type of neoplasm accounting for 0.5%–3% of mammary carcinomas. According to WHO guidelines, MpBCs are classified as spindle cell, squamous cell, matrix‐producing, carcinosarcoma, or osteoblastic, although they can be further described according to unique histotype. , , , A biphasic MpBC, carcinosarcoma contains both epithelial and sarcomatous components, indicated by co‐expression of epithelial indicators like AE‐1/3, and mesenchymal indicators like vimentin and SMA. Differential histological diagnoses of MpBC include myoepithelial carcinoma, myofibroblastic tumors, malignant phyllodes tumors, pleomorphic adenoma, and adenomyoepithelioma. Poorly understood and difficult to diagnose and treat, MpBC poses a greater risk than more common types of breast cancer. MpBC was not officially recognized as a distinct histological carcinoma until 2000, which has limited research on this devastating cancer. , Breast carcinosarcoma resembles the clinical features of invasive ductal carcinoma and is often treated in a similar way, utilizing anthracycline and taxane‐based regiments. This treatment paradigm, however, contradicts growing evidence that MpBC is a distinct molecular entity. MpBCs have a high incidence of a triple‐negative (TN) phenotype, lacking receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and HER2, , , , limiting targeted treatment options. One retrospective analysis by Xuexin et al. concluded that in TN MpBC patients, chemotherapy was not associated with improved survival. Large‐scale studies have investigated how receptor presence impacts the survival outcomes of MpBC patients, although the results are contradictory. A study by Schroeder et al. found that HER2 positivity was correlated with greater MpBC survival than other MpBC molecular subtypes, but a similar study by Jinquian et al. did not find this effect. A study by Hu et al. compared patients with TN MpBCs to patients with receptor‐positive MpBCs, and found that only the patients with the TN molecular subtype experienced greater survival rate",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,6048,far_neg_PMC,0.017242776,0
35871249,"Rep15 interacts with several Rab GTPases and has a distinct fold for a Rab effector. INTRODUCTION. Vesicular trafficking involves a precisely controlled flow of transport vesicles between the endocytic and secretory/exocytic pathways and this flow is tightly controlled by Rab GTPases. Rab GTPases have defined membrane locations and mediate the exchange of cargos between different organelles via selective binding and recruiting of distinct Rab interacting proteins. Rab GTPases are the largest branch of the small GTPase family and more than 70 Rab family members have been reported so far. Similar to other small GTPases, Rab GTPases act as molecular switches. In the GTP-bound form, Rab is in an active state (on) and GDP-bound Rab is inactive (off). Two regulatory proteins tightly control the cycling between the on and off states. These are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that catalyze exchange of GDP by GTP and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) that deactivate Rab by increasing the rate of GTP hydrolysis. GTP-bound Rabs interact with various downstream effector molecules and Rab:effector complexes spatiotemporally control the distinct steps of vesicular trafficking. Rab:effector recognition provides functional specificity and determines the various stages of trafficking. Most Rabs can interact with more than one effector molecule and similarly, effectors are also capable of interacting with phylogenetically similar Rabs. Dysfunction of Rabs or their regulators or effector proteins contributes to various disease states. Rab15 is enriched explicitly in the brain and its distinct isoforms are expressed in neuroblastoma cells. In CHO cells, Rab15 co-localizes with Rab 4 and 5 on early endosomes/sorting endosomes (SE) and also with Rab11 on the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC), suggesting that it has distinct roles in the different endocytic compartments which can be achieved by recruiting different sets of effector molecules. In previous work, we have shown that Rab15 interacts with a plethora of bMERB family member effectors such as MICAL1, MICAL3, MICAL-cL, EHBP1 and EHBP1L1. However, additional studies are required to elucidate the functional significance of the Rab15:bMERB interaction. Apart from bMERB family members, Rep15 is another Rab15 effector molecule that regulates transferrin receptor trafficking. Recently multi-omics analysis data suggested REP15 as a novel colorectal cancer-specific driving gene. Rep15 interacts with Rab15 at the ERC, and overexpression and depletion of Rep15 by si RNA attenuates the recycling of internalized transferrin receptor recycling via ERC without affecting receptor trafficking through sorting endosomes. Rep15 is one of the least well-characterized Rab effectors; hence there remains a large gap in understanding the binding mode of the Rep15:Rab15 interaction and it also raises the question as to whether Rep15 only interacts with Rab15 or also has other uncharacterized interaction partners. Rab3 family members are also brain and neuro-endocrinal enriched GTPases and are implicated in the secretory pathway. The mammalian Rab 3 subfamily is comprised of 4 paralogs (Rab3A, 3B, 3 C, and 3D). Rab3 proteins are associated with secretory vesicles and have a role in the secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters. Active Rab3 is localized to secretory vesicles and synaptic vesicles and dissociates upon depolarization of the nerve terminal. Active Rab3 has been shown to interact with various effector proteins, including Rabphilin3A, Rabin3A, RIM, Noc2, synapsin, Myo5a, Slp4-a and NMHC IIA. Single/double knockout mice of Rab3 paralogs are viable, whereas a triple knockout was lethal only if Rab3A was deleted. Knockout mice lacking all four mammalian RAB3 paralogs (RAB3A–D) show perinatal lethality, however, they show no changes in synaptic organization and only a minor change in neurotransmitter release. This might be due to the presence of highly expressed Rab27A/B on the synaptic vesicles, since Rab3 and Rab27 share some common effector molecules. Besides having a role in vesicular transport and early development, Rab 3 family members are also implicated in several cancers, but effector molecules involved are still to be identified. Here, we describe the mechanistic basis of Rep15:Rab interactions and show that Rep15 forms a stable complex with Rab15 with 1:1 stoichiometry. Using the yeast two-hybrid approach, we have identified Rab3 paralogs and Rab34 as novel Rep15 interaction partners and further validated the interaction by co-localization and biochemical experiments. To decipher the binding mode, we have determined the structure of Rep15:Rab3B and Rep15:Rab3C complexes, respectively. The structures show that Rep15 is a globular Rab effector. Detailed biochemical studies reveal that Rep15 is selective for Rab15, Rab3 paralogs and Rab34 and does not bind to other evolutionarily similar Rab GTPases. Mutational analyses of both Rep15 and Rab3A reveal the molecular basis for Rab selectivity. Rep15 knockout experiments in U138MG glioblastoma cells show that Rep15 depletion leads to a decrease in cell proliferation and cell migration and also influences transferrin recycling. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. BIOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF REP15:RAB15 INTERACTION. Rep15 is composed of 236 amino acids (UniProt ID: Q6BDI9) and in the present work, a naturally occurring N101D Rep15 variant (VAR_039548) was used (Supplementary Fig. 1a). SMART and IterPro database searches show that the Rep15 has no putative functional domains and shares no homology with any known Rab effector or other proteins. By yeast-two hybrid and pull-down approaches, Strick et al., have shown that the Rep15 is an effector molecule for Rab15 and co-localizes to endosomal membranes. However, the biochemical characterization of this complex is not available. To understand the mechanism underlying Rep15:Rab15 complex formation, we purified full-length Rep15 and Rab15GppNHp and monitored their complex formation by analytical size exclusion chromatography (aSEC).

No significant difference has been found on the amount of border extension under the influence of training. However, 70 to 85% of the subjects had some improvement after verbal instruction practicing, while only 50 to 65% of the same subjects showed improvement through visual feedback. It is suggested that doing research related to the jaw border movement on healthy subjects does not have to train them to obtain comparable data.

ZUT-8 shows high chemical stability, functional adjustability, and excellent output performance of friction power generation, which is superior to traditional coordination polymer materials. The cathodic protection system with ZUT-8 can prevent metal corrosion significantly. The output performance can be improved effectively by enhancing the conjugate effect of the linker.

In this study, we have investigated the structural dynamics of full-length ZIKV NS4B protein through 3D structure models using molecular dynamics simulations and experimental techniques. Also, we employed a reductionist approach to understand the dynamics of NS4B protein where we studied its N-terminal (residues 1-38), C-terminal (residues 194-251), and cytosolic (residues 131-169) regions in isolation in addition to the full-length protein. Further, using a series of circular dichroism spectroscopic experiments, we validate the cytosolic region as an intrinsically disordered protein region. The microsecond-long all atoms molecular dynamics and replica-exchange simulations complement the experimental observations. Furthermore, we have also studied the NS4B proteins C-terminal regions of four other flaviviruses viz.

36136910,"Predicting Septic Shock After Emergent Ureteral Stenting in Stone-Related Obstruction and Presumed Infections. Introduction: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria have long been used to predict septic shock. The sequential organ failure assessment and quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) scores have been suggested to be more accurate predictors. This study aims to compare SIRS and qSOFA for predicting of septic shock in the setting of retrograde ureteral stenting for obstructing stones and concomitant urinary tract infection. Methods: A retrospective review of records at two centers of consecutive patients was performed. Patients with unilateral ureteral obstruction by a stone who underwent ureteral stent placement and suspicion of urinary tract infection were identified. Primary endpoints were SIRS and qSOFA positive scores, intensive care unit admission, and vasopressor requirements. Results: A total of 187 patients were included. SIRS criteria were met in 103 patients (55.1%) and in 30 patients who experienced septic shock. qSOFA criteria were met for 24 patients (12.8%) and in 18 patients who experienced septic shock. Specificity for postoperative septic shock was significantly higher for qSOFA than for SIRS criteria (75 vs 29.1%, McNemar test p < 0.001). Both SIRS and qSOFA had significant areas under the curve (AUC), qSOFA had a fair AUC of 0.750, p = 0.001, whereas SIRS had a poor AUC of 0.659, p = 0.008. Univariate logistic regression of SIRS and qSOFA for septic shock showed: qSOFA (odds ratio [OR] 46 [0.25-228], p = 0.001) and SIRS (OR 2.29 [0.716-7.37], p = 0.162). Conclusion: Although SIRS offers higher sensitivity, qSOFA score may offer advantages over SIRS criteria in evaluation of risk for septic shock for patients who present with obstructing ureteral stone and urinary tract infection.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,6076,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.002458213,0
36167302,"Surgical Treatment of Pineal Region Tumors: An 18 year-Experience at a Single Institution. BACKGROUND The pineal tumor was once considered as a restricted area for surgery. Such cases are rare, with many different opinions on surgical treatment. This study aimed to review our experience of tumor treatment in the pineal region and explore the optimal treatment strategy. METHODS The clinical data of 72 patients with pineal tumors from January 1997 to May 2015 (18 years) were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative preparation, pathology type, tumor resection rate, surgical approach, and follow-up outcomes were used as the indicators to evaluate the treatment efficacy. RESULTS The Krause approach was used in 46 cases, the Poppen approach in 10 cases, and the transcallosal-lateral ventricle-choroid fissure approach in 16 cases. The postoperative pathological results were as follows: 24 cases of germinoma, 11 of teratoma, 15 of glioma, 6 of meningioma, 11 of Pineocytoma, 2 of cholesteatoma, 2 of cavernous hemangioma, and 1 of choriocarcinoma.

36194634,"Evolution avoids a pathological stabilizing interaction in the immune protein S100A9. SIGNIFICANCE. Protein stability constrains protein evolution. While much is known about evolutionary constraints on destabilizing mutations, less is known about the constraints on stabilizing mutations. We recently found a mutation to an innate immune protein that increases its stability but disrupts its function. Here, we show, through careful biophysical and functional studies, that this mutation stabilizes a nonfunctional form of the protein through a direct interaction with another amino acid. We find that specific amino acids can be tolerated at each of the interacting positions individually but not at both simultaneously. This pattern has been conserved over millions of years of evolution. We highlight an underappreciated evolutionary constraint on stabilizing mutations, namely, that they must avoid inappropriately stabilizing nonfunctional protein conformations. Protein stability constrains protein evolution (1–5). This is intuitive for destabilizing mutations, as a mutation that disrupts the folded form of a protein will likely be deleterious. The evolutionary constraints on stabilizing mutations are, however, harder to understand. Under what circumstances does it matter that a mutation makes a protein too stable? Conflicting arguments have been advanced for enzyme stability–function tradeoffs. In many cases, increasing stability can decrease important dynamics related to catalysis or product release (6–9); in contrast, other studies show a positive correlation between enzyme stability and function (10, 11). The generic constraints on excess stability as proteins evolve, particularly for nonenzymatic proteins, remain poorly understood. We recently identified a site in a protein that seemingly evolved to avoid deleterious stabilization (12), providing an excellent opportunity to probe how the requirement to avoid stabilizing mutations might constrain evolution. We isolated the mutation in question while studying the evolution of proinflammatory activity in mammalian S100A9 proteins. S100 proteins across amniotes activate the receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) by an as-yet poorly understood mechanism (Fig. 1A) (13–16). This activity evolved in the ancestor of all mammals when a gene shared by all amniotes (ancCG) duplicated and diverged into the last common S100A9 ancestor (ancA9) (Fig. 1B) (12, 17). Using Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (ASR), we found that ancCG had negligible proinflammatory activity, ancA9 had moderate activity, and S100A9 proteins from placental mammals had high activity (Fig. 1B). This proinflammatory function arose, in part, when Met replaced Phe at position 63 in S100A9. Here, and throughout the manuscript, we identify amino acids by their numbering in the human sequence. Intriguingly, we found that reverting this position in human S100A9—hS100A9/M63F—both compromised the proinflammatory activity of the protein and increased its stability (Fig. 1C) (12). Relative to hS100A9, hS100A9/M63F required a higher concentration of urea to unfold, exhibited slower unfolding kinetics, and was much more resistant to proteolysis (12). We also showed that intact hS100A9, but not its proteolytic products, was the active TLR4 agonist, indicating that the mutation disrupts activity by altering the native functional state of the protein. Here, we combine chemical denaturation experiments, structural biology, and hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) to understand the molecular mechanism for the stabilizing and functionally disruptive effects of this mutation. We find that a single position, Phe37, forms a “molecular staple” with Phe63. This interaction stabilizes a distorted, nonfunctional structure of the protein. A bioinformatic analysis reveals that S100A9 proteins frequently have Phe at either site but rarely at both sites. Thus, for this family of immune proteins, evolution must avoid a pathological stabilizing interaction that compromises function by stabilizing nonfunctional protein conformations. RESULTS. In our previous work, we found that reverting Met63 to its ancestral Phe state in human S100A9 (hS100A9) both increases its stability and decreases its proinflammatory activity (Fig. 1C) (12). To better understand evolutionary constraints on stability, we set out to understand the origins of this altered stability and function. M63F STABILIZES A CALCIUM-BOUND CONFORMATION OF THE PROTEIN. We first hypothesized that the mutation disrupts function by stabilizing an inactive, calcium-free form of the protein. Like most S100 proteins, S100A9 forms a homodimer with two pairs of calcium binding sites (18). Upon calcium binding, S100A9 undergoes a conformational change that exposes a hydrophobic cleft (Fig. 2A; shaded red) (18). This cleft is the surface through which S100 proteins typically interact with target proteins (19–23). If the mutation stabilized an inactive, calcium-free conformation, this would explain how increased stability altered protein function. To test this hypothesis, we determined which conformation(s) of hS100A9 were stabilized by M63F. We measured the unfolding free energy (ΔGunfold) of hS100A9 and hS100A9/M63F in increasing concentrations of calcium, as follows: 0 mM, 0.5 mM, and 5 mM Ca2+. We measured equilibrium unfolding of the protein in urea by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy monitored at 222 nm, which reports on protein α-helical content. We fit a two-state model to the data, which had free parameters describing ΔGunfold in water, the dependence of ΔGunfold on urea concentration (m-value), and the native and denatured baselines (24). We analyzed the data in two ways. First, we fit a global m-value for all protein variant/calcium concentrations. This is a reasonable assumption for hS100A9 and hS100A9/M63F, as the proteins differ by a single amino acid and the m-value is strongly correlated with the amount of hydrophobic surface area that is exposed upon protein unfolding (25). These are the data presented throughout the text and figures. Se",PMC,pos,1,pos,6089,pos_PMC,0.05696638,0
36359960,"Artificial Neural Network Assisted Multiobjective Optimization of Postharvest Blanching and Drying of Blueberries. 1. INTRODUCTION. Blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) is a popular soft fruit grown in broad locations around the world. The presence of bioactive compounds such as ascorbic acid and anthocyanins makes them powerful free radical scavengers [1]. However, fresh blueberries are highly perishable and should be processed to extend their shelf life and off-season availability. As one of the oldest food preservation methods, drying is widely used in preserving seasonal fruit and reducing postharvest losses [2]. The surfaces of blueberries are covered by a waxy hydrophobic layer, which has low moisture permeability and significantly limits mass transfer and slows the drying process [3]. Numerous mechanical, chemical, and thermal pretreatments have been used to overcome this limitation of drying. Chemical dipping and hot water blanching pretreatments can ameliorate the permeability of the berry skin and enhance moisture transfer. However, the chemical residue may lead to food safety risks and cause additional environmental problems with wastewater [4]. In addition, hot-water blanching usually leads to a mass of soluble components lost in the hot water by leaching. High-humidity hot air impingement blanching (HHAIB) is a unique and effective thermal treatment technology that combines the advantages of steam blanching and air impingement technologies. Recently, HHAIB has been used to pretreat peppers [5] and grapes [6]. In a typical HHAIB process, berries are directly impinged by superheated steam at a high velocity for a short duration, which destroys the waxy hydrophobic layer and avoids the loss of water-soluble nutrients [7]. However, the optimal HHAIB conditions for blueberries remain to be determined. In order to provide high-quality dried berries to meet the growing demands of health-conscious consumers, multistage or combined drying technologies have been applied for berries. Among them, hot air (HA) drying is one of the most extensively used technologies. However, the low drying efficiency and high energy consumption are not favorable for the quality preservation and sustainability of the process. Hot-air-assisted IR drying offers many advantages, such as low capital investments, greater energy efficiency, and a higher heat transfer rate, which result in reduced drying times and higher drying rates for different products [8]. However, the conventional infrared emitters, such as ceramic emitters, quartz emitters, and gas combustion emitters are usually large in size, complex in configuration, and difficult to install. In recent years, a new type of IR emitter made from carbon-fiber sheets was developed. The thickness of this new IR emitter is only 2 to 4 mm, and it can easily be activated by a regular voltage (220 V/110 V). This new emitter has a relatively simple configuration, a thinner thickness, and a more compact volume, which makes it easy to install in limited spaces such as an HA drying chamber or a vacuum chamber [9]. The proper design of an HAIR drying system that couples the advantages of both HA and carbon-fiber infrared heating may be more efficient compared to the single technologies for the postharvest processing of blueberries. The main goals of optimizing the postharvest blanching/drying processes for fresh agricultural products are to maximally maintain quality features, including texture and chemical composition, and to minimally consume energy and drying time. Rehydration capability is an important property of dried blueberries, which reflects the irreversible changes in the microstructure and texture properties of food material subjected to different processing conditions. A higher rehydration capability usually indicates lower microstructure damage [10]. Ascorbic acid, a major antioxidant substance in blueberries, is vulnerable to heating. The content of ascorbic acid in dried blueberries is commonly monitored to track the nutrient loss during thermal processes. It is often assumed that if sufficient ascorbic acid is preserved, other nutrients will be preserved as well [11]. Interest in high-quality dried blueberries has increased in recent years, particularly due to its popularity as an ingredient in pizza, breakfast cereals, and various vegetable and fruit dishes [12]. In fact, the optimization of drying conditions is usually multiobjective in nature and involves minimizing the drying time (DT) and specific energy consumption (SEC) and maximizing the ascorbic acid content (VC) and rehydration capacity (RC). Currently, the highly nonlinear relationships between drying parameters and objective functions can be simulated using machine learning approaches, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), which have been proven to be effective in modeling complicated and ill-defined engineering problems [13]. The multiobjective optimization (MOO) problem using an ANN model is to find a vector of decision variables that satisfy the restrictions of all objective functions. MOO problems can be resolved in two different approaches. The typical strategy is to convert other objectives into constraints or to merge two or more objectives into a single objective variable using the weighted sum method. However, the weight selection is easily prejudiced by human subjectivity [14]. The other approach for solving MOO problems where multiple objective functions are optimized and obtained under conditions that are in conflict with each other is finding the Pareto-optimal solution. The Pareto-optimal solution is a set of solutions that are not dominated by any other solution in the solution space, where improvement in one objective requires a certain sacrifice of the others [15]. The most critical step in this solving procedure is to find the Pareto front, which contains a series of Pareto optimal solutions within the design space. Once the Pareto front is established, it is simple to choose the best one according to the specific drying requirements.

36361557,"Molecular Mechanism of Sirtuin 1 Modulation by the AROS Protein. 1. INTRODUCTION. Reversible lysine acetylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification (PTM) regulating all types of proteins, from metabolic enzymes to scaffold and signaling proteins [1]. Sirtuins are an evolutionarily conserved family of NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases, with seven isoforms, Sirt1-7, in mammals [2]. They regulate metabolic programs and stress responses and have been implicated in aging-related diseases [3]. Sirtuins are part of complex signaling networks and act as metabolic sensors via their NAD+ dependency, and they are further regulated by PTMs and interacting proteins, but these regulatory mechanisms are little understood. Sirt1 is a nuclear isoform and regulates, e.g., metabolism and gene expression. It is considered a therapeutic target for cancer, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington’s disease and metabolic syndrome, and a variety of small molecule Sirt1 modulators have been developed [3,4,5]. Sirt1 features the conserved Sirtuin catalytic core of ~270 amino acids, which consists of a large NAD+-binding Rossmann fold subdomain and a small, structurally more variable Zn2+-binding subdomain (Supplementary Figure S1A) [6]. The binding site for the acetyllysine-containing protein substrate is a cleft between these two subdomains, which undergo a closure movement upon binding of substrate and/or NAD+ cosubstrate [7,8]. The cores of the other human Sirtuin isoforms show the same fold and between 22% and 45% sequence identity to that of Sirt1, with Sirt2 and Sirt3 being its closest homologs (Supplementary Figure S1B). Sirtuins feature isoform-specific N- and C-terminal extensions, however, and the rather large Sirt1-specific extensions contribute to its stability and activation [9,10]. The C-terminal region comprises a ~25 residue “essential for Sirt1 activity” (ESA) motif, which integrates into the Rossmann fold and supports catalytic core stability and thereby activity (Supplementary Figure S1A) [10,11]. At the N-terminus, a small three-helix bundle domain mediates binding and activation by sirtuin-activating compounds (STAC) and thus is referred to as the STAC-binding domain (SBD). It appears to serve as a docking site for the compounds and to wedge them against the active site entrance of the catalytic domain/substrate complex [5,6,12]. Several interacting proteins have been described to regulate Sirt1 activity. The proteins “deleted in breast cancer 1” (DBC1) [13,14] and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) “transactivator of transcription” (Tat) [15] inhibit Sirt1. DBC1 appears to compete with the C-terminal ESA region for binding to the Sirt1 catalytic core to prevent Sirt1 activation by ESA [9,11]. The protein Tat was initially identified as a Sirt1 substrate, but it also binds to the Sirt1 catalytic domain in an inhibitory mode, a complex interplay that is not fully understood [15]. The only Sirt1-binding protein that seems to activate its deacetylase activity is the “active regulator of Sirt1” (AROS) [16], a small nuclear and cytoplasmic protein, which has a role in ribosomal function [17] and was originally identified as ribosomal protein S19 binding protein 1 (RPS19BP1) [18]. AROS was reported to enhance Sirt1-mediated deacetylation of its substrate p53 in vitro and in vivo, thereby inhibiting the p53-dependent transcriptional activation [16]. The Sirt1-specific activation was proposed to result from a direct interaction of AROS with Sirt1 residues 114–210, which comprise the SBD and part of the likely flexible Sirt1 N-terminus [16]. However, other studies showed activation of cellular Sirt1-dependent p53 deacetylation by AROS only after cell damaging stress [17] and in vitro even inhibition of Sirt1 by AROS instead of activation [10]. Similarly, Kokkola et al. [19] reported AROS-dependent inhibition in vitro and no Sirt1 modulation in mammalian cells after AROS overexpression and suggested that substrates, biological context, and even buffer composition might affect the interaction and the effect on SIRT1 activity. The functional and mechanistic details of the interaction of Sirt1 and AROS thus remain to be clarified. Here, we describe a molecular characterization of AROS and how it regulates Sirt1. We find that AROS is a partly intrinsically disordered protein that inhibits through competition with the substrate peptide. Mapping interaction epitopes in Sirt1 and AROS and a crystal structure of a Sirtuin/AROS peptide complex provide a model for the regulatory complex, with an AROS motif occupying the substrate peptide binding channel. Our results thus provide molecular insights into the modulation of Sirt1 by a physiological regulator protein and suggest the peptide site as an opportunity for Sirt1-targeted drug development. 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. 2.1. MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HUMAN AROS PROTEIN. Analysis of the AROS protein sequence revealed no significant similarity to other protein sequences or motifs. It indicated, however, a potential disorder (Figure 1A,B). Predictions of secondary structure elements with PSIPRED [20] suggest that unstructured regions alternate with potential α-helical regions (Figure 1A). The sequences analysis with the programs DISOPRED [21] and PONDR [22] led to partially differing results (Figure 1B): For residues 21–54, DISOPRED and PONDR concordantly predicted a disordered region, while PSIPRED predicted an α-helical structure for residues 37–49. Nevertheless, these results indicate that AROS might be an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), possibly with a partial and/or temporary fold. For the experimental analysis of AROS’s structure and Sirt1 modulation mechanism, we aimed to establish its mg scale recombinant production in E. coli. AROS was highly expressed but accumulated as inclusion bodies, despite the variation of parameters such as construct and temperature. We thus established a refolding protocol for the preparation of mg amounts of AROS, starting from an earlier prot",PMC,pos,1,pos,6106,pos_PMC,0.994146,1

BACKGROUND Non-invasive ventilation may alter the morphology and histology of the upper airway mucosa. This study aimed to investigate the alterations of hypopharynx and oropharynx mucosa, identified during oro-tracheal intubation procedure via video-assisted laryngoscopy, in severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 related, treated by non-invasive ventilation via full-face mask or helmet. METHODS Data of patients affected by Coronavirus 2 admitted to COVID Hospital of L'Aquila (Italy), presenting hypopharynx and oropharynx morphology alterations, requiring oro-tracheal intubation for invasive ventilation and initially treated with non-invasive ventilation were included in the study. The study aimed to investigate the upper airway mucosa alterations using oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal images and biopsies taken during video-assisted-laryngoscopy. Data from the hypopharynx and oropharynx morphology and histology alterations between non-invasive ventilation via a full-face mask or helmet used during hospitalization were compared. RESULTS From 220 data recorded, 60 patients were included in the study and classified into non-invasive ventilation full-face mask group (30/60) and via helmet group. Comparing data between groups, significant differences were found with respect to hyperemia (77% vs. 20%), laryngeal bleeding ulcerations (87% vs. 13%), and vocal cord edema with >50% narrowing of the tracheal lumen (73% vs. 7%), respectively. The histology examination revealed fibrin-necrotic exudate with extensive necrotic degenerative changes in the sample tissue of the groups. There were not any differences in the duration time of non-invasive ventilation, time from hospitalization and the start of ventilation between groups. CONCLUSIONS The data from this research suggested that there were differences in airway mucosa damages among patients treated with a full-face mask or helmet.

The purpose of this study is to validate lung ultrasound score (LUS) for prediction of surfactant replacement therapy (SRT) in Indian infants of 27-336/7 weeks gestational age (GA). This prospective diagnostic accuracy study was conducted in a level 3 neonatal care unit in India. Consecutively born preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) were enrolled. Surfactant was administered if oxygen requirement exceeded > 30%. Baseline characteristics, respiratory parameters, and lung ultrasound images were recorded soon after admission and compared between surfactant and non-surfactant groups. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) and diagnostic accuracy of LUS were calculated for SRT. Among 78 infants with RDS included in the final analysis, 62 received surfactant (79.48%). Median time of performing lung ultrasound was 50 min of life in both groups. Median LUS in the anterior and posterior chest areas of either side as well as total LUS was significantly higher in the surfactant group. After adjusting for other confounders, LUS was found to be a significant predictor of SRT (adjusted OR (95%CI): 1.55 (1.15-2.087)). Diagnostic accuracy of LUS was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (AUC (95% CI): 0.751 (0.64-0.842), p < 0.001). A cutoff score of ≥ 9 for LUS was considered optimal for SRT (sensitivity (95%CI): 70.97% (57.87-81.45), specificity (95%CI): 68.75% (41.48-87.87)). CONCLUSION Lung ultrasound is a valid diagnostic tool for SRT in Indian setting with a cutoff score ≥ 9. TRIAL REGISTRATION CTRI/2021/11/038269.

36500104,"Prediction of the Sound Absorption Coefficient of Three-Layer Aluminum Foam by Hybrid Neural Network Optimization Algorithm. 1. INTRODUCTION. Noise pollution is one of the four major environmental problems in the world at present; long-term exposure to a noisy environment affects people’s everyday life and rest, reducing people’s quality of life [1], and causes more serious can induce cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [2,3]. In recent years, sound-absorbing materials have been widely used. Traditional sound-absorbing materials such as sound-absorbing felt, sound-absorbing cotton, and rock wool, have a short service life, severe environmental pollution, and other problems. Open-cell aluminum foam, a new type of porous acoustic material [4], has low specific gravity, non-combustibility, corrosion resistance, and easy processing while absorbing noise [5,6]. There is no secondary pollution during production, use, and end-of-life recycling, and it is called “green material” [7]. The available research results show that the open-cell aluminum foam composite structure with double-layer sandwich cavity has better sound absorption performance at low and medium frequencies [8,9,10,11,12,13], and this study tries to investigate the sound absorption coefficient of the three-layer aluminum foam plus composite cavity structure at low and medium frequencies [14]. The absorption coefficient measurement of three-layer aluminum foam requires experiments through standing wave tubes. Testing the absorption coefficient of the three-layer plus cavity open-cell aluminum foam composite structure is complicated and challenging. In this case, an accurate model for sound absorption estimation is necessary [15,16,17]. The transfer matrix method is traditionally used to obtain the absorption coefficients of multilayer acoustic materials [17,18]. The commonly used models are the D-B empirical model [19], the equivalent fluid model proposed by Johnson-Champoux-Allard [20], and the Miki model obtained by Miki by modifying the D-B model [21]. The absorption coefficients calculated by several of the above models and the transfer matrix method have some accuracy. However, the accuracy for calculating the low-frequency case is low and requires unique structural parameters (flow resistivity, characteristic length, and curvature coefficient). With the development of intelligent algorithms and neural networks, more and more researchers are choosing neural networks to predict the acoustic properties of materials. Artificial neural networks (ANN) [22,23,24,25,26,27], radial basis function neural networks (RBF) [9], and generalized regression neural networks (GRNN) [28], are commonly used to predict sound absorption coefficients. The above neural network prediction methods have good accuracy but require a large amount of training data and are unsuitable for predicting small sample data. Among them, GRNN, as a powerful regression tool with a dynamic network structure, has nonlinear solid mapping capability, fault tolerance, and robustness [29,30]. However, the disadvantage is that its prediction accuracy is often affected by the spread value. A good set of spread values can significantly improve the accuracy of GRNN. Optimization algorithms can be used to optimize the spread value of GRNN. Afshin Faramarzi et al. (2019) proposed the equilibrium optimization algorithm (EO) [29,30], whose principle is inspired by the control volume mass balance, which can estimate the kinetics and equilibrium state, where each particle and its concentration as a search agent will randomly update the current best concentration value. The optimum solution we need is the concentration value obtained when the system reaches equilibrium. In addition to the more novel EO algorithm, researchers have also used the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-GRNN) [31] and the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA-GRNN) [32,33] in different neural networks for optimization adjustments to suit different research contents. In this study, the simple structural parameters of aluminum foam are used as input variables to construct a GRNN model with several parameters and sound absorption coefficients. The spread values in the model are optimized to obtain a model suitable for small sample sizes and have high accuracy. The error between predicted and experimental values is used to measure model accuracy. The study’s key is to optimize the spread value. The GRNN model with suitable spread value can guide the design of material structure parameters according to the model and obtain a more efficient sound absorption structure. In this study, Section 2 introduces the principle of the GRNN model and the specific steps of combining the EO algorithm. Section 3 is the acquisition of the structural parameters of aluminum foam in the experiment and the testing of the sound absorption coefficient, and proposes the criteria for measuring the model. Section 4 is the discussion of the model prediction results and experimental results, and Section 5 is the summary of the content of this study. 2. EQUILIBRIUM OPTIMIZER-GENERALIZED REGRESSION NEURAL NETWORK. 2.1. GENERALIZED REGRESSION NEURAL NETWORK. Donald F. Specht introduced the Generalized Regression Neural Network in 1991, a radial basis neural network. The GRNN has strong nonlinear mapping capability, flexible network structure, high fault tolerance, and robustness, which is suitable for solving nonlinear problems. The GRNN is established based on non-parametric regression [34,35]. The GRNN usually constructs its input pattern representation through an intermediate layer that provides a specific number of units. Each unit of this intermediate layer is intentionally defined and characterized by an activation function. The GRNN is a kind of neural network whose function is to construct the internal representation of the input model through the proper configuration of the middle layer and can personalize the “features” of each input belonging to the training set [36].

36539586,"1H, 13C, and 15N assignments of the mRNA binding protein hnRNP A18. BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT. Heterogeneous ribonuclear protein A18 (hnRNP A18), also known as cold inducible RNA binding protein (CIRBP) is an RNA binding protein (RBP) differentially upregulated in breast, melanoma, pancreatic, and colon solid tumors in response to low oxygen tension (Chang et al., 2016; Pamboukian, 2011; Yang and Carrier, 2001; Yang et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2010). In response to cellular stress, such as UV or hypoxia, hnRNP A18 translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol where it stabilizes target mRNAs for pro-survival genes, such as hypoxia inducible factor 1-α (HIF1-α), thioredoxin (TRX), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) (Chang et al., 2016; Solano-Gonzalez et al., 2021). HIF-1α is the master regulator of the hypoxic cellular response, which controls gene expression for functions such as angiogenesis, tumor metastasis, cellular metabolism, glucose uptake, cellular proliferation, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis (Rankin and Giaccia, 2016; Rankin et al., 2016; Semenza, 2012). Elevated expression of HIF-1-α and hnRNP A18 is associated with poorer cancer patient prognosis (Chang et al., 2016; Rankin and Giaccia, 2016). Applications that either directly or indirectly decrease HIF1-α expression and are utilized in combination with other anti-cancer therapies have demonstrated an increase in response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Tang and Zhao, 2020). However, there are currently no FDA approved therapies that target HIF-1-α. CTLA-4 is an immune checkpoint receptor that downregulates the cellular immune response toward self-tissues and treatment of patients with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, such as Ipilimumab, have demonstrated increased progression-free survival in late stage metastatic melanoma, when compared to traditional chemotherapeutics alone (Lipson and Drake, 2011; Walunas et al., 1994). To address the unmet need of HIF-1-α inhibition, but also combine the therapeutic benefits of immunotherapy modulation, potent and selective hnRNP A18 inhibitors are needed to provide effective treatment options for patients with disease refractory to immunotherapy modulators. hnRNP A18 is an 18.6 kDa protein that contains an RNA binding domain (RBD), consisting of an RNA recognition motif (RRM) (aa. 1–89), and an intrinsically disordered domain (IDD) (aa. 90–172). Upon cellular stressors, casein kinase 2 (CK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylate hnRNP A18 in the nucleus. hnRNP A18 translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol where it interacts with target mRNAs (Yang et al., 2006). The RRM of hnRNP A18 recognizes target mRNAs with a 52 nucleotide hnRNP A18 consensus sequence and interacts with the nitrogenous bases of such targets through conserved aromatic residues within two ribonucleoprotein consensus sequences (Creigh-Pulatmen 2014; Yang et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2010). However, the strongest interactions between hnRNP A18 and target RNAs require both the RRM and IDD (Yang et al., 2010). Recently, a multi-disciplinary team developed hnRNP A18 specific small molecule inhibitors that disrupt hnRNP A18 from interacting with target mRNAs (Solano-Gonzalez et al., 2021). These inhibitors were identified through the computer aided drug design (CADD) through a site identified ligand competitive saturation pharmacophore (SILCS-Pharm) protocol, which developed pharmacophore models that exploit the X-ray crystal structure of the hnRNP A18 RRM (aa. 1–91) (Coburn et al., 2017; Guvench and MacKerell, 2009; Raman et al., 2011; Raman et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2015). Over 720,000 potential drug-like compounds were screened against the pharmacophore models and 264 compounds were identified for further investigation based on their chemical and physical properties. NMR investigations produced lead compounds that subsequently demonstrated specificity and inhibition of hnRNP A18 (Solano-Gonzalez et al., 2021). However, structural, and dynamic changes of hnRNP A18 in the presence of posttranslational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation by CK2 and GSK-3β, may impact small inhibitor binding dynamics. The sequence-specific backbone and sidechain resonance assignments for hnRNP A18 were completed as a step toward probing dynamic changes in the structure and function of hnRNP A18 upon phosphorylation by CK2 and GSK-3β. These data are important for the longer-term goal of designing higher affinity and more selective small molecule inhibitors for hnRNP A18 that will enable both targeting of the hypoxic cellular response and the immune modulatory pathways exploited by cancer cells. METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS. PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION. hnRNP A18 was cloned into the Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression plasmid pET21a in frame with a 6x-His tag upstream. The pet21a-His6hnRNPA18 construct was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and a single colony was grown in 5 L of M9 minimal medium (Sambrook and Russell 2006) at 37 ºC with 15 N-labeled (> 99%) ammonium chloride (0.5 g/L) as the single nitrogen source and 13 C-labeled (> 99%) D-glucose (2.0 g/L) as the single carbon source. When the A600 reached 0.8, the incubation temperature was reduced to 18 ºC. His6-hnRNP A18 expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside), and cells were grown for an additional 16 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 20 min and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM Imidazole, 6 M urea and 1 mM PMSF). The resuspended cells were sonicated and subsequently centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 45 min to pellet cellular debris and the supernatant was filtered with a 0.45 μm syringe. Protein purification was achieved through Ni-affinity chromatography. A hand poured 10 mL Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare, catalog number 17-5318-01) column was equilibrated with lysis buffer and loaded with the filtered cleared lysate.

36604564,"Structure, sequon recognition and mechanism of tryptophan C-mannosyltransferase. MAIN. The posttranslational modification of proteins with carbohydrates includes glycosidic linkages to nitrogen, oxygen and carbon atoms, referred to as N-linked, O-linked and C-linked glycosylation. Among them, C-glycosylation is the least-well understood. It involves the formation of a carbon–carbon glycosidic bond between the C2 atom of the tryptophan side chain indole moiety and the anomeric carbon of an α-d-mannopyranose sugar (Fig. 1a). In humans, approximately 20% of all secreted or transmembrane proteins are predicted to be C-mannosylated. The modification has an essential role in the folding, stability, trafficking and function of secretory- and transmembrane proteins. This includes critical signaling proteins such as the type-I cytokine receptors, myelin-associated glycoprotein, adhesion GPCRs and Wnt/β-catenin. C-mannosylation is also found on important pathogen antigens, such as the soluble glycoprotein of Ebola virus, and essential adhesins of apicomplexan parasites, including the toxoplasmosis-causing Toxoplasma gondii and malaria-causing Plasmodium spp.. Beyond mammalian biology and diseases, C-mannosylation has been studied in the model nematode C. elegans, where it was shown to control Wnt-signaling to establish left/right asymmetry in neuroblast polarization and migration during development. While tryptophan C-mannosylation was discovered nearly three decades ago, the first tryptophan C-mannosyltransferase (CMT) was identified less than a decade ago: the C. elegans protein DPY19 (ref. 18). This enzyme was predicted to be an integral membrane protein belonging to the C-type glycosyltransferase superfamily (GT-Cs). All known CMTs are homologous to the C. elegans enzyme (CeDPY19), after which they are named. Unlike C. elegans, which contains a single CMT enzyme, humans have four paralogs, termed HsDPY19L1, HsDPY19L2, HsDPY19L3 and HsDPY19L4 (ref. 18), with HsDPY19L1 sharing the greatest sequence similarity with the C. elegans homolog. The human paralogs differ in their tissue expression profile and sequon preferences. HsDPY19L1, HsDPY19L3 and HsDPY19L4 are expressed ubiquitously, whereas HsDPY19L2 is found exclusively in the testis, where it plays an essential role in spermatogenesis. Loss of function mutations in HsDPY19L2 induce globozoospermia to cause male infertility. The reaction catalyzed by CMT enzymes occurs on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum and involves the transfer of a mannose unit from a dolichylphosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) donor to an acceptor protein containing a WxxW or WxxC consensus sequon (Fig. 1a). Like N-glycosylation and O-mannosylation, tryptophan C-mannosylation occurs before or during protein folding. The true extent and the physiological role of tryptophan C-mannosylation has long remained poorly understood. Biochemical tools that allow addressing these questions have only recently been developed. These include synthetic C-mannosyl-tryptophan conjugates, yeast-based high-throughput in vivo CMT-activity assays, bacterial lectins and monoclonal antibodies for the enrichment and mass spectrometric analysis of C-mannosylated peptides. These tools have been used to map the ‘C-glycome’ of the mouse brain and are driving rapid growth in the field. Yet important unanswered questions remain, including how the CMTs recognize their substrates and catalyze the formation of this unique carbon–carbon bond between protein and carbohydrate. While the structures and mechanisms of enzyme complexes catalyzing N-linked and, in part, O-linked protein glycosylation have been described, the mechanism of CMT-catalyzed tryptophan C-mannosylation is unknown. To understand how CMTs recognize sequons in unfolded proteins and covalently modify acceptor tryptophans with C-linked mannose, we determined high-resolution cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the archetypical C. elegans enzyme (CeDPY19) in complex with synthetic acceptor and donor substrates to capture distinct states along the reaction coordinate. Structure-guided mutagenesis facilitated a functional analysis of key residues involved in substrate recognition and catalysis. Collectively, these data reveal the basis of CMT substrate specificity and allow a structure-based mechanism to be proposed for this unique glycosylation reaction. RESULTS. CMT ACTIVITY IS NOT DIVALENT METAL ION DEPENDENT. We purified recombinantly expressed CeDPY19 and developed an in vitro assay that recapitulated the tryptophan C-mannosylation reaction using synthetic, fluorescently labeled peptides (WEHI-1881196, WEHI-1881197, WEHI-1881198, WEHI-1886494, numbered 1–4) based on known acceptor substrate sequences. As a donor substrate, we used a synthetic Dol-P-Man analog (Dol25-P-Man, 5), a compound that contains five isoprenoid units (25 carbon atoms) and had been successfully used as a mannose donor for the endoplasmic reticulum-resident GT-CMTs ALG3, ALG9 and ALG12 of the N-glycosylation pathway. We measured in vitro C-mannosylation using Tricine–SDS–PAGE (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a) and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) (Fig. 1c), which demonstrated the covalent attachment of a single hexose unit to the peptide. The activity of purified recombinant CeDPY19 was unchanged when reactions were supplemented with Mn2+ or Mg2+ salts, or with the metal ion chelator EDTA, suggesting that the enzyme does not require divalent metal ion cofactors (Fig. 1d). This is in stark contrast to oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) and O-mannosyltransferase (PMT1/2), the related GT-C enzymes responsible for N- and O-glycosylation of proteins: OST activity is metal dependent and available evidence indicates that PMT1/2 activity is likely also metal dependent. CMT’s metal independence and the unique nature of the chemical bond it forms suggests its mechanism diverges from that of PMT1/2 and OST, despite it using the same donor substrate (Dol-P-Man) as PMT1/2.

Polyacrylamide/urea gel electrophoresis reveals that lipid extract surfactant contained a major apoprotein band with apparent Mr 3500 and minor apoprotein bands with apparent Mr 15,000 and 7000. After reduction, the 15 kDa band disappears and is replaced by a prominent band with apparent Mr = 5000. Reduction also results in a relative diminution of the 7 kDa band and a relative increase in the intensity of the 3.5-kDa band. Edman degradation reveals two major peptide sequences which have been designated surfactant-associated peptide (N-terminal Phe) and surfactant-associated peptide (N-terminal Leu) and a minor sequence designated surfactant-associated peptide (N-terminal Ile). The latter surfactant-associated peptide appears to be related to the N-terminal Leu peptide but lacks the terminal Leu. N-Terminal analysis by dansylation demonstrates that the 15 and 5 kDa (reduced) apoprotein species contain N-terminal Phe, Leu and Ile. The 3.5 and 7 kDa bands contain only N-terminal Leu and Ile. Chromatography of lipid extracts on silicic acid columns gives rise to fraction I, which contains protein and phosphatidylglycerol, and fraction II, which contains protein, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. Fraction I was primarily composed of the 15-kDa apoproteins, while fraction II contained mainly the 3.5 and 7 kDa apoproteins. Both fractions exhibited biophysical activity after reconstitution with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. These results indicate that lipid extracts contain an oligomer of 15 kDa containing surfactant-associated peptide (N-terminal Phe) and surfactant-associated peptides (N-terminal Leu or Ile) which interact through sulfhydryl and perhaps other bonds. Lipid extracts also contain 3.5 kDa monomers of surfactant-associated peptides with N-terminal Leu and N-terminal Ile which can dimerize through sulfhydryl and perhaps hydrophobic interactions.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,6140,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.9701835,1
36643486,"Biophysical Characterization of the C-Terminal Tail of T. rubrum PacC Reveals an Inherent Intrinsically Disordered Structure with pH-Induced Structural Plasticity. INTRODUCTION. Trichophyton rubrum is a major fungal pathogen that causes superficial infections in human skin, hair, and nail to cause dermatophytosis. Upon infection, T. rubrum breaks down keratin and other proteins of skin and releases amino acids, whose further degradation leads to the secretion of ammonia, resulting in a shift in pH. The fungus hence encounters a shift in pH on the skin, from the initial pH ∼ 5.0 to pH > 8.5, during disease progression on the human host. The ability to sense and adapt to changing pH is key to survival and pathogenicity of T. rubrum and is regulated by the PacC transcription factor. The disruption of pacC in T. rubrum has been shown to result in a decreased secretion of keratinolytic proteases and reduced the ability of the mutant strain to infect human nails in vitro, highlighting its importance. PacC is a zinc finger-containing transcription factor with a conserved DNA-binding domain at its N-terminus and an acid-rich unique C-terminal tail. PacC, however, is synthesized in an inactive form and must undergo proteolytic removal of its C-terminal tail to attain an active state capable of initiating cellular response to pH change. Although the PacC-mediated pH-responsive signal transduction pathway is highly conserved among fungi, the molecular details of its activation vary. For instance, while the ∼625-residue Rim101-homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans is activated through a one-step proteolytic removal of the C-terminal tail to yield the active protein, a two-step cleavage reaction is required for the activation of the 674-residue inactive PacC of Aspergillus nidulans (PacC72). In S. cerevisiae, the one-step cleavage of ∼100 residues from the C-terminus results in a 531 residue long active protein. In A. nidulans, the first pH signal transduction-dependent cleavage removes ∼180 C-terminal residues from PacC72, yielding an inactive intermediate (PacC53), followed by a second pH-independent cleavage that removes additional ∼245 C-terminal residues from PacC,53 resulting in the functional ∼250-residue PacC. In the absence of alkaline ambient pH signaling, the inhibitory C-terminal tail is thought to assume a protease-inaccessible “closed conformation,” through interactions involving three regions in the tail, termed as interacting regions A, B, and C, thereby preventing activation. However, the molecular basis of pH-induced conformational changes in the C-terminal tail enabling proteolytic cleavage for activation remains unclear. The C-terminal tail of T. rubrum PacC is variable when compared to homologues (Figure S1A), with several insertions in the interacting regions A, B, and C, suggesting the incorporation of unique sequence features that may require organism-specific activation. In order to understand the structural properties of this C-terminal tail that aid its activation in response to pH, we have carried out its structural characterization, employing a diverse array of bioinformatics and biophysical methods. We find that the C-terminal tail is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) with intrinsic conformational flexibility and exhibits a stable initial structure at a wide range of pH but can attain a molten globule-like partially disordered structure under highly acidic conditions (pH 3.0 or lower). The unique IDP-like structural features of the C-terminal tail of T. rubrum PacC exhibited under in vitro conditions indicate inherent conformational flexibility necessary for the transcription regulator to shift from the inactive to active state during the adaptation to pH change in host cells. RESULTS. SEQUENCE PROPERTIES OF T. RUBRUM PACC REVEAL IT AS AN INTRINSICALLY DISORDERED PROTEIN. The PacC transcription factor of T. rubrum CBS118892 is encoded by TERG_00838 that yields a protein product corresponding to 815 residues. A search for conserved domains and sequence motifs identified an uncharacterized Q/N-rich region at its N-terminus, which appears to be unique to dermatophytes, followed by a short, 88 residue long Zn-finger domain (ZFD) and a long C-terminal tail (Figure 1A). The zinc-finger DNA-binding domain shows a high level of sequence conservation and harbors a conserved nuclear localization signal and the three C2H2 zinc-finger motifs required for its role as a transcription factor (Figure 1A). The C-terminal tail shows intermittent sequence conservation in contrast to the ZFD. The C-terminal tail consists of three interacting regions A, B, and C, which are required for locking the protein in its inactive state at acidic pH. Among the conserved sequence features in the tail are the two proteolytic sites required for the activation of PacC into its functional form, present in the interacting regions A and C, and the YPXL/I motifs required for binding to the pH-signaling PalA protein, present in the interacting region C (Figure 1A). Apart from these, no sequence motifs are present in the C-terminal tail. In addition, the interacting regions contain several insertions, especially in the interacting region C, thereby increasing the length of the extended C-terminal tail of PacC in T. rubrum in comparison to other homologues. A search for identifiable structural features in the C-terminal tail of PacC was carried out by first analyzing the predicted secondary and tertiary structures. Secondary structure prediction indicated a large number of random coil regions in PacC. The C-terminal tail was predicted as a disordered protein by PONDR, with intermittent long stretches of unfolded regions, typical of IDPs (Figure 1B). A substantial enrichment of charged and disorder-promoting amino acids (Glu, Asp, Lys, Gln, Pro and Ser) and the depletion of order-promoting residues, namely the hydrophobic (Ile, Leu and Val) and aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr and Trp), corroborate the predicted intrinsically disordered nature of the 231-residue C-terminal tail, PacCΔ1–584 (Figure 2).

The integrated surface electromyogram (IEMG) of the lumbar erectores spinae and the torque generated were simultaneously recorded from 27 healthy subjects in the standing posture while they pulled isometrically against resistance provided by a harness around the shoulders. The IEMG-torque ratio (efficiency of electrical activity, or EEA) was used to characterize each subject. Individual recordings showed evidence of nonlinearity of the IEMG-torque relationship in that a statistically better fit to experimental recordings was obtained by using two straight lines with a breakpoint between them. However, with repeated testing, the gradients of these two lines were more variable than the slope of the single straight line fitted to the entire recording. The slope of the best fit line (EEA) was less for recordings made during torque decrease than for increasing-torque recordings. This also showed as a ""hysteresis"" pattern in the recordings. The coefficient of variability (within subjects) of the EEA was greater in day-to-day testing (24%) than with repeated pulls at the same testing session (14%). This was similar to variability of the maximum generated torque. About 25% of the variability between subjects was found to be due to anthropometric differences. The residual variability of the relationship would limit the accuracy of IEMG as a measure of muscular effort under changing torque conditions.

36864742,"YbiB: a novel interactor of the GTPase ObgE. INTRODUCTION. Proteins of the Obg family belong to the TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases. In general, P-loop GTPases or G-proteins are found in all domains of life where they act as central regulators in numerous cellular processes by alternating between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state. The conversion of GTP to GDP is carried out by their characteristic G-domain, harboring five conserved sequence motifs responsible for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (1–3). As the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of P-loop GTPases is generally low, the reaction is often accelerated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), while guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) usually stimulate the exchange of GDP for GTP as nucleotide affinities are typically high in these GTPases (low nanomolar range) (4,5). The Obg protein family is further divided in five subfamilies: YchF, Ygr210, Nog1, DRG and Obg. GTPases from the Obg subfamily are widely conserved among bacteria, and also occur in many eukaryotes (3,6). In bacteria, Obg proteins typically consist of an N-terminal glycine-rich domain, followed by the G-domain and a less conserved C-terminal domain. In Obg from Escherichia coli (ObgE), the latter is an intrinsically disordered region of about 50 amino acids, containing a high number of negatively charged amino acids (7–10). Similar to many other G-proteins, Obg displays a very low intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate (6–8). However, while binding to the ribosome was reported to increase the GTPase activity (7,11), no ‘canonical’ GAP proteins have been assigned to Obg. Moreover, in contrast to ‘classical’ Ras-like G-proteins, Obg displays only a moderate nucleotide affinity (high nanomolar to low micromolar range) and correspondingly high nucleotide exchange rates, seemingly rendering regulation by GEF proteins obsolete (7,8,12–15). Finally, while G-proteins generally function as protein binding hubs to exert their function as cellular regulators, very little interactors of Obg have been firmly established so far (16,17). A role of Obg in a wide variety of fundamental cellular processes has been proposed over the years (6). The Obg protein was first described in Bacillus subtilis, where it is important for sporulation initiation (18). Additionally, in Streptomyces Obg was found to be involved in the formation of aerial mycelium (19,20), indicating that Obg plays a role in the onset of morphological differentiation in some bacteria. A plethora of experimental data indicates that Obg also plays a role in ribosome biogenesis as a late-stage assembly factor for the large 50S ribosomal subunit, while it also prevents untimely association of the 30S subunit and sterically hinders premature association of tRNA to the ribosome (11,21,22). Besides this regulatory role in ribosome biogenesis, Obg has been implicated in DNA replication, chromosome segregation and cell division (23–29). Furthermore, studies in E. coli and Vibrio harveyi suggest that Obg confers protection against UV-induced DNA damage, most probably by directly or indirectly activating RecA-dependent DNA repair systems (30–32). The observation that Obg binds efficiently to the alarmone ppGpp also suggests a functional link between Obg and the stringent response (7,8,13,33). This is further corroborated by coprecipitation and two-hybrid assays demonstrating that ObgE interacts with SpoT, a ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase regulating the stringent response in E. coli (15,34). Finally, Obg was identified as a key regulator of bacterial persistence in E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35,36). Bacterial persistence allows a small subset of bacteria within an isogenic population to withstand antibiotic treatment and is considered to be a major cause of chronic bacterial infections (37,38). Due to its conservation, functional versatility and its implication in bacterial persistence, Obg has been suggested as an attractive novel target for the development of antimicrobial compounds (39,40). Nevertheless, the exact role of Obg in the above-described processes and the interactions it makes within the associated pathways are still largely elusive. Upon searching for new ObgE interactors, we identified the DNA-binding TrpD2 protein YbiB. The TrpD2 protein family is part of the phosphoribosyl transferase III superfamily and shares a common fold with the homologous anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase (TrpD) and nucleoside phosphorylase class II (NP-II) families. Correspondingly, the X-ray crystal structure of the E. coli TrpD2 protein, referred to as YbiB, shows a head-to-head homodimeric architecture in which each monomer consists of an N-terminal α-helical domain and a C-terminal α/β domain. Despite their structural similarity, proteins of the TrpD2 family do not share the catalytic function of the TrpD nor the NP-II family. In contrast, the YbiB dimer displays two highly positively charged grooves on its surface with which it binds nucleic acids in a seemingly sequence-independent manner. Interestingly, in E. coli, the ybiB gene is part of a LexA-regulated operon, together with the dinG helicase gene. As LexA is the main suppressor of the SOS stress response, this suggests that YbiB may play a so far unknown role in the SOS stress response, which is activated upon DNA damage (41). In this paper, we establish YbiB as a novel high-affinity interactor of ObgE. Biochemical experiments, together with computational docking and X-ray crystallography establish that the binding is mediated by interaction of the negatively charged tail of ObgE with the positively charged patches on the surface of YbiB. Accordingly, ObgE interferes with YbiB’s DNA-binding capacity. MATERIALS AND METHODS.

Fatty acid binding protein was purified from renal medulla, and its binding activity and fatty acid composition were determined in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats. Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as controls. Fatty acid binding activity was higher in 5-week-old prehypertensive spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (0.155 +/- 0.006 mol palmitic acid/mol protein) as compared with control values in Wistar-Kyoto rats (0.030 +/- 0.001). However, in 40-week-old rats, the activity was decreased only in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats with established hypertension (0.035 +/- 0.002), and it did not decrease in Wistar-Kyoto rats (0.028 +/- 0.003).

36949076,"The RRM-mediated RNA binding activity in T. brucei RAP1 is essential for VSG monoallelic expression. INTRODUCTION. Monoallelic gene expression (MAE), or allelic exclusion, is essential for many organisms. Notable examples include genome imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, and random monoallelic expression of autosomal genes in mammals. Many genes that undergo MAE encode cell surface receptors. For example, each human and mouse olfactory sensory neuron expresses only one odorant receptor gene. Several microbial pathogens, including Trypanosoma brucei, employ MAE as part of their antigenic variation strategy. Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite that causes human African trypanosomiasis. It sequentially expresses distinct Variant Surface Glycoproteins (VSGs), its major surface antigen, to evade the host’s immune surveillance. VSG is monoallelically transcribed by RNA polymerase I from one of the ~15 nearly identical VSG expression sites (ESs). In these subtelomeric polycistronic transcription units, VSG is always the last gene located within 2 kb of the telomeric repeats. Parasites that express multiple VSGs are more rapidly eliminated by the host, underscoring the importance of VSG MAE for T. brucei survival. Many factors affect VSG MAE, such as nuclear lamina, the inositol phosphate pathway, transcription elongation, and a subtelomere and VSG-associated VEX complex. Our previous studies have demonstrated that TbRAP1, a nuclear and essential telomere protein, is a key regulator of VSG MAE. Depletion of TbRAP1 leads to derepression of silent VSGs up to a thousand-fold. The TbRAP1-mediated silencing is stronger at loci closer to the telomere than those further away. We recently reported that TbRAP1 possesses a dsDNA binding activity mediated by its R/K patch (737RKRRR741) in the DNA binding (DB) domain (aa 734–761). This dsDNA binding activity is essential for TbRAP1’s association with the telomere chromatin and TbRAP1-mediated VSG silencing. However, we do not understand the underlying mechanism of how TbRAP1 selectively permits the active VSG to be fully expressed while silencing other VSGs. Here our NMR studies identify an RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) in TbRAP1, while known RAP1 homologs have not been reported to have any RRM domains. Assisted by the R/K patch, TbRAP1 RRM binds the 16-mer consensus sequence of VSG 3’UTRs in vitro, while TbRAP1 binds the active VSG RNA in vivo. Strikingly, mutations in the RRM domain that specifically abolish the TbRAP1-VSG RNA interaction lead to an acute decrease in the active VSG RNA level by ~50% and subsequent derepression of all silent VSGs, thus disrupting both aspects of VSG MAE. In contrast, mutations in the R/K patch alone or in both the R/K patch and RRM lead to acute depression of silent VSGs, but the active VSG RNA is only moderately decreased by ~13%. Mechanistically, TbRAP1’s RNA and dsDNA binding activities compete in a substrate concentration-dependent manner. Such competition suggests a mechanism of VSG MAE where the active VSG’s abundant RNA antagonizes TbRAP1’s dsDNA binding-mediated silencing effect at the active VSG locus to sustain its full-level expression. RESULTS. TBRAP1 INTERACTS WITH THE ACTIVE VSG RNA IN VIVO. RAP1 homologs have been identified from kinetoplastids to mammals. None of the known RAP1 homologs has been reported to have any RNA binding activity. We previously found that TbRAP1 does not bind the telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) in RNA IP experiments. However, to our great surprise, we found that TbRAP1 interacts with the active VSG RNA (Fig. 1a, b). RNA crosslinking immunoprecipitation (RNA CLIP) assays were performed in TbRAP1F2H+/- cells that express VSG2 as the major surface antigen (Table 1), in which one TbRAP1 allele is deleted and the other has an N-terminal FLAG-HA-HA (F2H) tag. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis detected significantly more active VSG2 RNA in the TbRAP1 CLIP product than in the negative control IgG CLIP product (Fig. 1a). RNAs of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TbTERT), small nuclear RNA gene activation protein 50 (SNAP50), and Protein Kinase A catalytic subunit (PKAC1) were also examined in CLIP products. Approximately the same amount of TbTERT, SNAP50, and PKAC1 RNAs were detected in both TbRAP1 and IgG CLIP products (Fig. 1a). Therefore, TbRAP1 interacts with the active VSG RNA but not TbTERT, SNAP50, or PKAC1 RNAs. We also performed RNA CLIP in PVS3-2/OD1-1 cells (Table 1) that express VSG9 as the major surface antigen. Again, qRT-PCR detected significantly more VSG9 RNA in the TbRAP1 CLIP product than in the IgG control (Fig. 1b), indicating that TbRAP1 can interact with the active VSG RNA regardless of which VSG is expressed. Therefore, we report for the first time that TbRAP1 is associated with the active VSG RNA in vivo, an unprecedented finding for RAP1 homologs. THE TBRAP1 MYBLIKE DOMAIN CONTAINS AN RRM MODULE. To investigate whether the TbRAP1 MybLike domain (aa 639–761) is responsible for binding to the active VSG RNA, we first determined the solution structure of TbRAP1639-761 by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1). The N-terminal region of TbRAP1639-761 does not adopt a typical Myb fold but forms a canonical RRM (aa 653–727) with the characteristic topology of a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and two α-helices packed behind the β-sheet (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Fig. 1b). The DB domain (aa 734–761) at the C-terminus of TbRAP1639-761 forms a long and flexible loop (Supplementary Fig. 1b, left). In contrast, none of the known RAP1 homologs has been reported to have an RRM domain. RRM is a conserved structural platform that binds to diverse RNAs and ssDNAs. Sequence analysis shows that TbRAP1 RRM contains the signature RNP1 and RNP2 sequence motifs, with F655 in RNP2 and F694 in RNP1 representing the two conserved aromatic residues critical for substrate binding (Supplementary Fig. 1c). TbRAP1 RRM superimposes well with RRM1 of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 bound with an RNA oligo [10.2210/pdb5M",PMC,pos,1,pos,6176,pos_PMC,0.997065,1

PURPOSE To determine the relationship between imaging frequencies and prostate motion during CyberKnife stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer. METHODS Intrafraction displacement data for 331 patients who received treatment with CyberKnife for prostate cancer were retrospectively analysed. Prostate positions were tracked with a large variation in imaging frequencies. The percent of treatment time that patients remained inside various motion thresholds for both real and simulated imaging frequencies was calculated. Results: 84,920 image acquisitions over 1635 fractions were analysed. Fiducial distance travelled between consecutive images were less than 2, 3, 5, and 10 mm for 92.4%, 94.4%, 96.2%, and 97.7% of all consecutive imaging pairs respectively. The percent of treatment time that patients received adequate geometric coverage increased with more frequent imaging intervals. No significant correlations between age, weight, height, BMI, rectal, bladder or prostate volumes and intrafraction prostate motion were observed. CONCLUSIONS There are several combinations of imaging intervals and movement thresholds that may be suitable for consideration during treatment planning with respect to imaging and calculation of the margin between the clinical target volume and planning target volume (CTV-to-PTV), resulting in adequate geometric coverage for approximately 95% of treatment time.

It occurs without the prerequisites of population inversion or macroscopical coherence, rendering lower power consumption than the widely explored superlinear low-coherence emissions including superfluorescence, amplified spontaneous emission, and random lasing, and holds great potential for speckle-free imaging and interferometric sensing.

INTRODUCTION. 1.1. PREAMBLE. The Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) has developed scientific and clinical documents that have guided clinical care in the management of cardiac arrhythmias since 1996. This HRS-led expert consensus statement was developed in partnership with the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS), and the Latin American Heart Rhythm Society (LAHRS), and in collaboration with the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES), and the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology (ISHNE). This international expert consensus statement is intended to provide comprehensive guidance to cardiac electrophysiologists, allied professionals, and other supportive health care technicians and administrative professionals who participate in the management of cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) remote monitoring (RM) programs. 1.2. DOCUMENT SCOPE AND RATIONALE. The years since the publication of 2015 HRS Expert Consensus Statement on Remote Interrogation and Monitoring of Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Devices (2015 HRS Expert Consensus Statement on RM) have seen several key factors that have had direct and lasting impact on RM and RM management. The number of CIEDs implanted on an annual basis has grown to approximately 1.7 million worldwide. The number of patients followed remotely has increased significantly. Possible drivers of this increase in RM have been the class 1 recommendation in the 2015 HRS Expert Consensus Statement on RM to use RM for CIED patients as standard of care and the use of RM for staff safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, implantable loop recorders (ILRs), which are designed for alert-based management, have added significantly to the daily volume of data generated for RM clinic workflow. The overarching goal of this document is to provide evidence-based and expert consensus recommendations on how to effectively operate an RM clinic, whether hospital or nonhospital based. This takes a joint effort from RM clinic staff―which includes clinical and nonclinical personnel―hospital and health system administrators, payers, manufacturers, and regulators. Many topics considered for this document were identified through a survey of RM device clinic staff. RM is an international issue, but different jurisdictions face very different challenges related to RM availability and reimbursement. Although RM is beneficial, its increased use can place an extra strain on already limited device clinic resources. This additional workload magnifies preexisting challenges associated with CIED RM. Some of the issues identified by RM clinic stakeholders include managing differences unique to each CIED manufacturer (eg, monitoring hardware, connectivity, programmability, nomenclature, accessibility, and web-based platforms) as well as the dynamic evolution and complexity of new devices and technology. There are other issues specific to the needs of individual RM clinics, which include the coordination of patient enrollment, scheduling, reporting, billing, and interfacing with electronic medical records. Adequate staffing with both clinical and nonclinical personnel is required for an effective and efficient RM program. Appropriate staffing roles, ratios, and credentialing are discussed. Third-party services have emerged that allow for outsourcing some or all RM services. Some of the advantages, challenges, and costs that can come with these third-party services are presented. While RM is available around the world, some regions and jurisdictions face challenges in RM availability, uptake, and reimbursement. The barriers that lead to this disparity in RM use are explained. Patients and their caregivers are central to the RM process. Education is key to maintaining patient adherence and connectivity.

37255528,"Environmental determinants of infectious and chronic disease prevention behaviours: A systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative research. INTRODUCTION. The global burden of disease can be reduced through the modification of behavioural risk factors (Abbafati et al., 2020; Linardakis et al., 2015). However, an analysis of globally aggregated data from 2019 reported there was no meaningful progress in reducing exposures to behavioural risks between 1990–2019 (Abbafati et al., 2020) which indicates current interventions and approaches may not be sufficient in achieving long-term, sustainable health behaviour change. This has led to increased support and recommendations for regulatory health policies as an effective public health intervention when other strategies such as educational interventions and community programmes fail (Abbafati et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2014; Frazer et al., 2016; Hillier-Brown et al., 2017; Thomas et al., 2008). In 1986, the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion advocated for the socioecological model, which proposes two concepts: (i) behaviour both shapes and is shaped by multiple levels of influence; and (ii) individual behaviour affects and is affected by the social environment (World Health Organization, 2022). Health models which included the ecological component were early advocates for community wellbeing, which emphasized factors in the environment - such as community, neighbourhood, cultural norms, and policies - rather than modifying individual habits and behaviours. This also acknowledged the existence of complex individual-environmental interactions across all levels of behaviour (Golden and Earp, 2012; McLeroy et al., 1988; Stokols, 1992). As a result, people were viewed within the context of their environments, and health promotion programs highlighted solutions to modify these conditions to promote favourable health behaviours (Golden and Earp, 2012). The success of environmental interventions has been demonstrated previously in the implementation of regulatory smoke-free policies and more recently in the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) government restrictions. Although tobacco use is still prevalent globally, public health approaches to tobacco interventions in the form of regulatory health policies have reduced smoking, reduced second-hand smoke exposure, and improved health outcomes over time in many regions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; Linardakis et al., 2015; World Health Organization, 2014). COVID-19 was also a major worldwide public health burden which led to the swift introduction of regulatory policies promoting prevention and control, such as stay-at-home orders, physical distancing, and mandatory mask use in community settings (Gebru et al., 2020). In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions for much of 2020, government restrictions reduced COVID-19 transmission (Brauner et al., 2021; Haug et al., 2020; Wibbens et al., 2020). Particularly, more intrusive regulations which focus on movement restriction such as workplace and school closures, stay-at-home orders, and travel bans reduced infection rates (Haug et al., 2020; Wibbens et al., 2020). Through this, it is evident the implementation of regulatory policies drives behaviour change through increased compliance. However, downstream impacts and between-level relationships with other environmental (e.g., built environment, culture, community), social, and individual factors of disease prevention behaviours are underexplored. Qualitative research exploring smoke-free policies and COVID-19 restrictions have investigated public perceptions and beliefs surrounding impacts of such factors on preventive health behaviours (Chen et al., 2021; Hackshaw et al., 2012; Heid et al., 2021; Highet et al., 2011). The outcomes of this review will provide insights into the environmental influences of behaviour, reveal relationships between levels of behaviour, and offer guidance for future policy implementation and behaviour change interventions. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative primary research investigating the environmental determinants of smoke-free policies and COVID-19 restrictions on individuals' infectious and chronic disease prevention behaviours to generate overarching themes and novel interpretations of results (Mays et al., 2005; Thomas and Harden, 2008). The literature on smoke-free policies and COVID-19 restrictions were combined as both: (a) were under the direct influence of regulatory policies at the time of this review, (b) emphasize preventive actions in community settings to protect health, and (c) have a substantial amount of published primary qualitative literature. No study has used structured and transparent knowledge synthesis methods to identify, characterize, and synthesize themes from all available qualitative studies in this area. METHOD. REVIEW APPROACH. This review followed the Cochrane Collaboration handbook (Higgins et al., 2021), and thematic synthesis guidelines outlined by Thomas & Harden (Thomas and Harden, 2008). A reporting guideline for qualitative research syntheses, known as the Enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research (ENTREQ) framework was also followed (Tong et al., 2012). The review question was: “What are the cultural, societal, and regulatory policy determinants on individuals’ infectious and chronic disease prevention attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours?” The population and setting of interest were adults aged 18 or older in a community setting. Studies were excluded if they investigated preventive health behaviours in the private setting such as the home and multiunit housing; employees in the organizational context (e.g., healthcare staff, restaurant workers); institutionalized individuals (e.g., patients, prisoners); and adolescents and children <18 years old. The outcome of interest was behavioural determinants (e.g., attitudes, beliefs, intentions) and behaviour.

Formation of the autophagosome, sequestration or capture of content, and closure all require the ATG proteins, which act together in an efficient process set up as a hierarchy of complementary activities that are highly conserved [1]. Autophagy is upregulated by external stress conditions, such as nutrient deprivation, UV damage, and hypoxia. In long‐lived cells such as neurons, health and survival are dependent on autophagy [2], in particular selective forms of autophagy such as aggrephagy (removal of protein aggregates), mitophagy (removal of mitochondria) and ERphagy (removal of ER). In general, the role of autophagy, in particular selective autophagy, in human diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer is complex [3] and will not be discussed here. Initially identified in yeast through genetic screens, there are about 15 core ATG genes in mammalian cells (for comprehensive reviews, see Refs [4, 5]). Briefly, the initiation of autophagy begins with the formation of a phagophore, a double membrane with a curved cisterna, which expands, captures content (cargo) and closes, becoming an autophagosome. The phagophore and autophagosome are well described in morphological studies by many techniques, including confocal imaging, transmission electron microscopy, correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), and cryo‐soft X‐ray tomography (Cryo‐CLXM) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Visualisation of autophagosome formation has largely relied on the detection of the lipidated tagged‐ATG8s both in vitro and in vivo experiments, although other peripheral membrane‐associated ATGs (e.g. ULK1, ATG13, Beclin1, WIPI2, ATG5, ATG16L1) can be detected to allow the different stages of autophagosome formation to be revealed. The composition of the initiating membrane, called the omegasome [11], which precedes the phagophore, is not precisely known, but its formation is driven by lipid synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [12, 13] and the transfer of lipids through the ATG2A/B proteins, which are equilibrated through the activity of the lipid scramblase ATG9A [14, 15]. The consensus view is that the omegasome and phagophore membranes are similar to the ER, containing proportionally more phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) than the plasma membrane [16]. In yeast, Atg9 vesicles have been shown to nucleate a membrane around cargo, which can expand to become an autophagosome [17]. In mammalian cells, the picture is more complex. Vesicles containing the lipid scramblase ATG9A are thought to either provide a seed membrane (similar to the yeast system [18]) or contribute significantly to the protein composition to alter the lipid composition of the phagophore membrane (Fig. 1), perhaps using a kiss‐and‐run mechanism [15, 19]. The central autophagy kinase complex ULK1/2 plays a key role in orchestrating these early events, in particular the trafficking of ATG9A [7]. Recruitment of ATG13, a subunit of ULK1, to the initiating membrane [20] occurs by binding PtdIns 4‐Phosphate (PtdIns 4‐P). PtdIns 4‐P is produced by PtdIns‐4 Kinase IIIβ (PI4KB), which is delivered by ATG9A vesicles [19]. Additional modification of the PtdIns in the early stages of the omegasome and later of the forming phagophore by the class I PtdIns‐3 kinase complex I (PI3KC3‐C1) occurs downstream of the key autophagy kinase, ULK1 [21]. ATG14, the class I‐specific component of the PI3KC3‐C1 complex, localises to the ER [20], and binds through the BATS domain [22], which recognises PtdIns in higher curvature membrane domains [23, 24]. The BATS domain in ATG14 contains an amphipathic lipid packing sensor (ALPS) motif, which senses the packing of lipids in the bilayer [25]. ALPS motifs are considered long amphipathic α‐helixes. An amphipathic α‐helix (AH) is also found in VPS34, another subunit of the PI3KC3. Acquisition of PtdIns3P on the omegasome and phagophore recruits autophagy‐specific effectors such as DFCP‐1 [11] and WIPI2 [26]. WIPI2 then recruits the E3‐like complex ATG12—ATG5‐ATG16L1 to the phagophore, which directs the association of ATG8s with membranes through covalent modification by PtdEtn (lipidation). Interestingly, ATG16L1 contains two regions that allow membrane association, one being an amphipathic α‐helix [27]. Lipidation mediated by the ubiquitin‐like conjugation pathway (see below) is critical for phagophore expansion, autophagosome growth and closure in both non‐selective and selective autophagy. During and after lipidation, discrete perturbations of the membrane bilayer mediated by the conjugation pathway proteins and ATG8 occur due to the intrinsic association of these proteins with the bilayer. Recent findings about the mechanism of membrane association of ATG3 [28] and the ATG8 proteins [29], described below, have contributed to a further understanding of how protein‐membrane interactions influence autophagosome formation. THE ATG8 FAMILY. In yeast, there is a single Atg8, while in mammalian cells, there are six ATG8s, three in the LC3 family and three in the GABARAP family [30, 31]. ATG8s are small ubiquitin‐like proteins that have essential roles in autophagy and unique functionality. ATG8s have a ubiquitin core and a unique N‐terminal domain formed by two α‐helices. Most critical for selective autophagy and the best studied function of the ATG8s is their ability to bind cargo containing a LIR (LC3‐interacting region) motif (for review, see Ref. [31]).

37339717,"The 5-HT7 receptors in the VLO contribute to the development of morphine-induced behavioral sensitization in rats. The 5-hydroxytryptamine 7 receptor (5-HT7R) is one of the most recently cloned serotonin receptors which have been implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including drug addiction. Behavioral sensitization is the progressive process during which re-exposure to drugs intensified the behavioral and neurochemical responses to drugs. Our previous study has demonstrated that the ventrolateral orbital cortex (VLO) is critical for morphine-induced reinforcing effect. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of 5-HT7Rs in the VLO on morphine-induced behavioral sensitization and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that a single injection of morphine, followed by a low challenge dose could induce behavioral sensitization. Microinjection of the selective 5-HT7R agonist AS-19 into the VLO during the development phase significantly increased morphine-induced hyperactivity. Microinjection of the 5-HT7R antagonist SB-269970 suppressed acute morphine-induced hyperactivity and the induction of behavioral sensitization, but had no effect on the expression of behavioral sensitization. In addition, the phosphorylation of AKT (Ser 473) was increased during the expression phase of morphine-induced behavioral sensitization. Suppression of the induction phase could also block the increase of p-AKT (Ser 473).

37448718,"The impact of basketball on the social adjustment of Chinese middle school students: the chain mediating role of interpersonal relationships and self-identity. 1. INTRODUCTION. Social adjustment is the process by which individuals’ perceptions and behaviors change in response to changes in the social environment, adapting to the social environment in which they live (Weissman, 1975). In social life, each individual has their unique way of dealing with the world and people and has aspirations and needs for interpersonal interaction, cooperation, friendship, respect, reputation and achievement, all of which depend on the individual’s social adaptation for their fulfilment. Social adjustment is an essential competency for the student population, and the development of social adjustment is an important responsibility of schools. In contrast, middle school is critical in developing students’ physical and mental health. Physical maturity creates a sense of adulthood in middle school students, who want to acquire some of the powers of the majority, find new standards of behavior and desire to change social roles. However, their minds are still immature, many expectations cannot be met, leading to mental health problems such as frustration (Yao, 2002). The study showed that while middle school students’ levels of positive adjustment were relatively stable, their negative adjustment tended to increase with grade level (Li et al., 2017). If a person is not in tune with society, they will develop a state of mind incompatible with everything in their environment, leading to psychological distortions over time. Strong social adjustment skills can help middle school students reduce stress, regulate negative emotions and control aggressive behaviors, effectively promoting mental health (Heath et al., 2017). Scholars have widely discussed the question of how to improve young people’s social adjustment skills. A recent cross-sectional survey with a large sample showed a strong positive correlation between physical activity and social adjustment (Chen et al., 2022). Social adjustment theory and integrated adaptive development theory suggest that an individual’s adjustment skills are developed through continuous learning and exploration in life practice (Bristol, 1915). At that level, physical activity as a positive social interaction activity may improve individuals’ social adjustment. Therefore, this study also takes this as a starting point to explore the effects of physical exercise on the social adjustment of middle school students and the mechanisms of its influence using an experimental approach of basketball intervention. There may be an essential mediating role in physical exercise to improve the social adjustment of individuals. Interpersonal relationships are the mutual psychological relationships that people establish with each other during ordinary activities to satisfy their various needs (Hartup, 1989). Social connection theory suggests that healthy adolescent development requires good connections with those around them. When relationships with others are faulty, adolescents feel less secure and regular interpersonal communication is compromised, leading to poor interpersonal and social adjustment (Hirschi, 2002). The interpersonal relationships of middle school students entering middle school have changed significantly (Fuligni et al., 2001), The interpersonal relationships of middle school students entering middle school have undergone significant changes They are less psychologically and emotionally dependent on their parents and teachers and are more eager to build good interpersonal relationships with their partners (Steinberg, 1990). Therefore, at this particular time, the interpersonal relationships of middle school students may be one of the most critical factors affecting their level of social adjustment. The theoretical model of the psychological benefits of physical exercise suggests that physical exercise can directly influence behavioral performance, such as interpersonal interactions (Tomporowski et al., 2011). Some studies have found that individuals who regularly participate in physical exercise are more likely to have improved interpersonal relationships (Kim et al., 2021), consistent with the concept proposed by this theoretical model. Thus, interpersonal relationships may mediate the pathway by which physical exercise influences middle school students’ social adjustment. Self-Identity generally refers to “the principle orientation of an individual’s self-perception, the conviction of self-emotional experience, the monitoring of self-regulation and the fixation of self-evaluation” (Johnson, 1982). According to Erikson’s self-identity theory, the positive and stable development of self-identity is a primary psychological task during adolescence and is of great importance for adolescents’ physical and mental health and individual wellbeing (Zahn-Waxler et al., 1995). Research has shown that a positive self-identity of young people can help them adapt to society (Kim and Yang, 2019). At the same time, positive self-identity enables young people to have good personality traits, good survival skills and a healthy psychological state, to maintain a positive and enthusiastic attitude toward life to face the pressures and challenges of reality, to study hard, to work hard and to take up social responsibilities, all of which are concrete manifestations of identification with society and adaptation to culture (Gao and Feng, 2013). Research has shown that during physical exercise, individuals continue to feel positive changes in themselves and thus receive positive feedback, increasing their self-efficacy, self-confirmation and self-confidence levels (Anderson et al., 2007). This virtuous cycle increases the individual’s psychological capital, reduces low self-esteem, increases self-confidence and helps the individual develop positive and healthy values and worldviews, which in turn positively affects the individual’s self-identity. Currently, there is a general consensus in the research on moderate intensity physical activity that moderate",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,6257,far_neg_PMC,0.0023141266,0
37459524,"Intramolecular structural heterogeneity altered by long-range contacts in an intrinsically disordered protein. SIGNIFICANCE. Mean-field and scaling theories have repeatedly been used to describe many physics phenomena. Natural candidates for such theories in proteomics are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that lack secondary structures and fluctuate between numerous conformations. Using small-angle X-ray scattering and time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer, we study the intramolecular structural heterogeneity of a model IDP system. Similar to the folding of structured proteins, we find that short-range interactions and long-range contacts play an essential role in the IDP’s flexibility and its ensemble of conformations. Our findings show that while the average structure can be predicated based on minimal parameters, specific sequence motifs and context are needed to describe the ensemble. Consequently, simplified homopolymer theories are insufficient to describe heterogeneous IDPs. It has been more than two decades since the structure-to-function paradigm was challenged by the discovery that intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), that lack fixed 3D structures, have significant biological functions (1, 2). Yet, many questions relating the primary sequence to biological function remain open (3–5). IDPs are known to participate in many cellular functions (6, 7) and to remain unstructured even in the crowded environment of the cell (8). IDPs can become structured or remain unstructured while participating in protein–protein interaction (9). Either way, the interaction can be very strong while fully retaining the IDP’s structural disorder (10). For IDPs, a dynamic ensemble of conformations characterizes its “structure” (11). But, a fundamental yet unresolved question is to what extent IDPs can be treated as conventional polymers, versus requiring consideration of intramolecular structural heterogeneity derived from the amino acid sequence? Some IDPs have minimal sequence heterogeneity [e.g., PAS repeats (12, 13), GRGDSPYS repeats (14), SR and RRRRR repeats (15), and FG repeats (16)] and are thus expected to behave as conventional long homopolymers. However, other more heterogeneous IDPs show discrepancies with these polymeric models (17, 18). Therefore, evaluating intramolecular structural heterogeneity may highlight fundamental properties and their relation to the IDPs’ sequence, allowing unraveling of their function. IDPs can be divided into three major archetype sequences (19): polar tracts, polyelectrolytes, and polyampholytes. Each type could exhibit intramolecular structural heterogeneity depending on its sequence (17). For example, it was shown that polyelectrolyte regions are locally stretched due to electrostatic repulsion as opposed to electrostatic bridges in the polyampholyte regime (20). Moreover, it was found that IDPs can include collapsed domains due to the hydrophobic interaction (16). The conformational ensemble (i.e., sizes and shapes) of many polyelectrolytic IDPs vary, as expected, as a function of the net charge per residue (NCPR) (15, 20–22). The NCPR is a simple average metric, which by definition cannot capture heterogeneity. Therefore, in the case of IDPs that are more polyampholytic or richer in polar residues, NCPR might not fully capture its heterogeneity. The next level of description would be the variances of charge and hydrophobicity patterning parameters, which can capture additional heterogeneity and long-range contacts (23–27). Unlike the coarse-grained metrics above, the impact of long-range contacts on an IDP’s ensemble of structures is difficult to evaluate. These contacts contribute on case-by-case bases, similarly to structural folded proteins. For example, long-range contacts were found to contribute to the intramolecular heterogeneity of the IDP prion monomer, which adopts collapsed and extended regions (28). Recently, it has been shown that, long-range contacts in the cold denatured state made the ensemble contract, deviating from the homopolymer model (29). Similarly, long-range stickers of aromatic residues tend to contract IDPs (30). Another work showed that long-range interactions can contract an IDP after swapping < 2% of the residues (31). These results show that IDPs’ ensembles are highly sequence dependent. IDPs are often measured in isolation. This raises the question to what extent does their context influence their behavior. Here, we will show that IDP segments measured in the context of flanking sequences have long-range contacts that can expand the ensemble of conformations. We will demonstrate the conditions that such contacts are rather common phenomena and influence the ensemble in a consistent manner. The structural flexibility of IDPs encourages us to approximate and describe them with mean-field polymer physics theories. Treating IDPs as polymers suggests that, for large intermonomer spacing, they would display fractal-like behavior with an approximate scaling relation . Here, < .. > denotes the ensemble average, are the coordinates of monomers x ∈ {i, j}, and ν is the Flory scaling exponent. For rigid rod, self-avoiding, and ideal polymer, ν is expected to be 1, 3/5, and 1/2, respectively (34). The polymer radius of gyration (Rg) and end-to-end distance (Ree) are common measurable properties of the polymer’s ensemble average structure. However, the Flory exponent is a more convenient parameter to compare the structural compactness of polymers with a different number of residues (N) as Rg ∝ Ree ∝ Nν (35). For example, this was used to show that denatured unfolded proteins behave as excluded volume random coils with ν = 0.598 ± 0.028 (36). On average, across different sequences, IDPs behave as ideal chain (or chain in θ-solvent) with ν = 0.522 ± 0.01 (37). The latter indicated that IDPs are more compact than chemically denatured proteins and that individual IDPs can show large deviations from the average value.

37507019,"Activation of human RNA lariat debranching enzyme Dbr1 by binding protein TTDN1 occurs though an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain. The RNA lariat debranching enzyme, Dbr1, hydrolyzes the 2′-5′ bond in intron lariats produced by the spliceosome (1, 2). These intron lariats are rapidly degraded by exonucleases following Dbr1 hydrolysis. The DBR1 gene was first identified in yeast genetic screens aimed at identifying factors which restrict Ty1 retrotransposition (3). Saccharomyces cerevisiae develop a modest growth defect with Dbr1 ablation, and Saccharomyces pombe exhibit a more severe growth defect attributed to the greater number of intron-containing genes in the latter strain (4). In metazoa, DBR1 is an essential gene, and Dbr1 knock-out mice are inviable (5, 6). Loss of Dbr1 impairs class-switch recombination of immunoglobulin genes, promotes oncogenesis, impairs HIV replication, and compromises cell-intrinsic immunity to viruses (5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11). Inhibition of Dbr1 could be protective from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases linked to toxic aggregates of TDP-43. Excess lariats can reduce the toxicity of TDP-43 aggregates (12, 13, 14). Dbr1 is a metallophosphoesterase (MPE) enzyme. MPEs are nucleases and phosphatases that use a two-metal ion active site cluster formed by a highly conserved GNHD/E motif. In Dbr1, this motif contains an Asn(N) which coordinates an Fe2+ ion, a catalytic His (H) which protonates the 2′ leaving group, and a structural Asp (D) that forms solvent-inaccessible hydrogen bonds with a neighboring beta-strand. Dbr1 enzymes are unique MPEs because they have a Cys (C) residue in place of an Asp (D) that is conserved in every other MPE. This substitution leads to a stable Zn2+-Cys bond that has been observed in crystal structures from two independent groups. This bond protects the adjacent Fe2+ co-factor from oxidation (15, 16, 17). Metazoan Dbr1 homologs (i.e., human, mouse) contain ∼200 aa at the C terminus that are absent in yeast or amoeba Dbr1 enzymes. A nuclear localization sequence is located in this region (residues 511–528) (18, 19), but no other biological functions are ascribed to this region, and no structural data are available for human Dbr1. Crystal structures are available for Entamoeba histolytica Dbr1, and in these structures, the C terminus is ∼50 aa and plays a structural role only, consisting of three alpha helices ∼8 to 20 aa which lay along the backside of the enzyme, distal to the active site and RNA binding surfaces (16, 20). All disease-causing human Dbr1 mutations identified to date affect buried residues in the N-terminal MPE domain and are predicted to destabilize the catalytic domain (21). Dbr1 forms a complex with the homologous, noncatalytic protein Drn1 in yeast and humans. In yeast, this interaction enhances the turnover of branched RNA (22). In human cells, Dbr1 immunoprecipitates with the human Drn1 homolog (Cwf19-L1) (18). Mutations in Drn1 homolog are linked to cerebellar ataxia (23). Additionally, several high-throughput co-IP-MS screens have identified interactions between human Dbr1 and the protein trichothiodystrophy nonphotosensitive 1 (TTDN1) (24, 25). TTDN1 is a protein previously implicated in trichothiodystrophy (26) but has no known biochemical function. The effects of Drn1 or TTDN1 interactions with Dbr1 on either activity or substrate specificity are unknown. Here, we examine biochemical and biophysical properties of human Dbr1. We examine how the C-terminal domain contributes to Dbr1 activity and stability. We determine the metal cofactors required for human Dbr1 catalysis. We demonstrate that TTDN1 protein levels are determined by Dbr1 levels in human cells and that Drn1 and TTDN1 interact directly with Dbr1. We find that TTDN1 increases the catalytic efficiency of Dbr1 by 19-fold but does not alter the substrate specificity of Dbr1. These data clarify the requirements for lariat metabolism in humans and offer new mechanistic details on the role of Dbr1 in human health and disease. RESULTS. THE C-TERMINUS OF HUMAN DBR1 IS INTRINSICALLY DISORDERED. Analysis of the human Dbr1 amino acid sequence with BLAST (27, 28) reveals a MPE domain spans approximately the first 300 aa residues, and aligns to many other MPE enzymes, while the C-terminal domain (residues ∼350–544) has no homology to any annotated functional domain (Fig. 1A). The order/disorder predictor PONDR uses the relative frequency of charged and hydrophobic residues to forecast the presence of disordered regions (29), and PONDR clearly predicted that the C-terminal ∼150 aa of Dbr1 are unstructured (Fig. 1B). Consistent with this PONDR prediction, unstructured polypeptide is present in the C-terminal domain of an hDbr1 Alpha-Fold model (Fig. 1C) (30, 31). We tested this prediction by expressing and purifying Dbr1 from a prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) and a eukaryotic (Sf9 insect cell) expression system, and we performed 1D-proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on the purified protein samples (Fig. 1D, top). Both samples gave intense peaks from methyl groups (0.8–0.5 PPM), consistent with the presence of random coil polypeptide (Fig. 1D, middle) (32). The amide and aliphatic proton regions were indistinguishable for the two samples. We concluded that hDbr1 had the same folded state when expressed in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells and that the presence of the random coil was not an artifact of heterologous expression in prokaryotic cells. A circular dichroism spectra of E. coli expressed hDbr1 is presented in Fig. S1B. THE DISORDERED C TERMINUS STABILIZES DBR1 BUT IS NOT REQUIRED FOR ACTIVITY. To measure how the disordered C terminus contributed to Dbr1 activity or stability, we created a series of C-terminal truncations by introducing stop-codons after residues 253, 314, 332, 399, 443, and 502.

37516919,"Determinants of iFGF13-mediated regulation of myocardial voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels in mouse. INTRODUCTION. Voltage-gated Na+ (NaV) channels are key determinants of myocardial excitability, driving the fast upstroke of the action potential and the conduction of electrical impulses through the myocardium (Chen-Izu et al., 2015). While most NaV channels undergo rapid activation and inactivation to generate the transient Na+ current (INa), a fraction (∼0.5%) of the channels remains open, generating a small persistent Na+ influx, known as the late Na+ current (INaL), which contributes to determining action potential duration. In ventricular myocytes, NaV channels are composed primarily of the NaV1.5 pore-forming (α) subunit, and these channels function in macromolecular protein complexes. As such, channels are embedded within local signaling domains in which they are dynamically regulated by a rich repertoire of accessory proteins and posttranslational modifications (PTMs; Marionneau and Abriel, 2015). Defects in NaV1.5 channel functioning and/or regulation underlie diverse forms of inherited or acquired cardiac arrhythmias (Remme and Bezzina, 2010). Impaired inactivation of NaV1.5 channels, notably, alters channel availability and/or enhances INaL, both of which can cause arrhythmia syndromes, including long QT syndrome type 3, Brugada syndrome, or conduction slowing. Leveraging the endogenous regulatory mechanisms of NaV1.5 channels is therefore essential for deciphering arrhythmogenic NaV current defects. Several recent studies demonstrated that the cardiac NaV1.5 protein is highly phosphorylated, and that phosphorylation-dependent regulation of NaV1.5 channels is critical in regulating the expression and functioning of these channels, as well as interactions between the NaV1.5 α subunit and channel accessory proteins (Marionneau et al., 2012; Lorenzini et al., 2021). This is the case, for example, of serines 1933 and 1984 in the C-terminal domain of NaV1.5, which regulate interactions with intracellular fibroblast growth factor 13 (iFGF13) and calmodulin, and modulate associated channel inactivation properties (Burel et al., 2017). While numerous phosphorylation sites have been identified on the NaV1.5 protein, phosphorylation of the other channel components and the impact of these modifications on NaV1.5 channel expression or properties remain largely unexplored. Potential candidates for NaV channel regulation by phosphorylation are the iFGFs, also known as fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs). The iFGFs have emerged as pivotal players in controlling the inactivation properties of cardiac NaV1.5 channels, tuning both channel availability, inactivation kinetics, and INaL (Wang et al., 2011a, 2017; Park et al., 2016; Abrams et al., 2020; Gade et al., 2020; Chakouri et al., 2022; Santucci et al., 2022). The iFGF family comprises four members (iFGF11 = FHF3, iFGF12 = FHF1, iFGF13 = FHF2, and iFGF14 = FHF4), and further diversity is achieved through the generation of alternatively spliced isoforms with highly divergent N-termini (Munoz-Sanjuan et al., 2000). The iFGFs are small intracellular proteins that have been shown to interact directly with the membrane-proximal portion of the C-terminal domain of NaV channel α subunits in a 1:1 stoichiometry through their highly homologous FGF core domain (Goetz et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011b). The structural basis by which iFGFs regulate NaV channels emerged in 2012 with the crystal structure of the ternary complex formed by a NaV C-terminal domain, an iFGF and Ca2+-free calmodulin (Wang et al., 2012), and was more recently modeled using the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the American cockroach NaV channel, NaVPas (Shen et al., 2017; Gade et al., 2020). The different iFGF isoforms demonstrate species-, age-, tissue-, and subcellular-specific expression patterns, and affect NaV channel properties distinctively (Yang et al., 2016). In addition to their broad distribution in the nervous system, the iFGFs are prominently expressed in the mammalian heart. While iFGF13-VY is the predominant iFGF isoform in adult mouse ventricles, with in vivo Fgf13 knockout mice displaying conduction slowing (Park et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017), iFGF12-B is the preponderant iFGF in human heart (Santucci et al., 2022) and has been linked to inherited arrhythmias including Brugada syndrome (Hennessey et al., 2013), long QT syndrome type 3 (Liu et al., 2003), idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (Li et al., 2017), and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias with sudden cardiac death (Musa et al., 2015). In addition to its ascribed function in regulating NaV channel inactivation properties, it has also been reported that iFGF13 influences the cell surface expression of NaV1.5 channels in cardiomyocytes (Wang et al., 2011a, 2017). Evidence for a role for iFGF phosphorylation in regulating iFGF-dependent regulation of NaV channels has been provided for neuronal NaV channels, driven in large part by the identification of kinases that regulate the iFGF-NaV channel interface. Specifically, it has been reported that phosphorylation of neuronal NaV channels by glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β; Shavkunov et al., 2013; James et al., 2015; Hsu et al., 2017), protein kinase CK2 (Hsu et al., 2016), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII; Wildburger et al., 2015), as well as the tyrosine kinase janus kinase 2 (JAK2; Wadsworth et al., 2020), promotes binding of iFGF proteins to NaV channels and associated iFGF-mediated channel regulation. In this study, we investigated the pattern of phosphorylation of native iFGF13 in adult mouse left ventricles and explored the effects of manipulating the identified iFGF13 phosphorylation sites in the regulation of cardiac INa. In addition, we explored iFGF13 isoform expression profiles and the consequences of iFGF13 knockdown/knockout and rescue on cardiac INa in ventricular myocytes isolated from neonatal and adult mice.

This is a case report presenting the behavioral and dental management of a 9-year-old child recently diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, seizure disorder, and psychosis and treated with anticonvulsant and antidepressant medications. In this case, seizure semiology was presented as eye blinking during the attack, and the child was usually not conscious. It is absorbed by itself and associated with a post-sleeping attack that lasts for minutes. CASE DESCRIPTION. Parents presented to the pediatric dental clinic with a chief complaint of decayed teeth that needs to be restored. The child has mixed dentition and is diagnosed with anterior crossbite and single posterior crossbite. The child was cleared by the pediatric neurologist and psychiatrist and had no contraindications to dental treatment under local anesthesia. The child's treatment was completed on the dental chair without any seizure attacks, and the patient's chief complaint was resolved. CONCLUSION. Pediatric dentists should be educated about dental precautions and consider drug interactions when treating children with autoimmune encephalitis. Various types of non-pharmacological behavior guidance techniques and pharmacological methods of behavior management techniques can aid in the behavioral management of children with psychosis. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE. Alowi WA, Baghlaf K. Behavioral and Dental Management of a Pediatric Patient Diagnosed with Autoimmune Encephalitis: A Case Report. Int J Clin Pediatr Dent 2023;16(2):416–419. B ACKGROUND. Acute encephalitis is a debilitating neurological disorder that is caused by brain inflammation and develops as a rapidly progressive encephalopathy (usually in <6 weeks). In high-income countries, the estimated incidence of encephalitis is about 5–10/1,00,000 inhabitants per year. Encephalitis affects patients of all ages and represents a significant burden to patients, families, and society. In children, autoimmune etiology has been demonstrated with several forms of encephalitis (e.g., anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis) or (e.g., Rasmussen's encephalitis, limbic encephalitis, and opsoclonus myoclonus). Studies reported the long-term prognosis of autoimmune encephalitis is 80% with substantial and full recovery. In dental practice, treating children with special health care needs is considered challenging. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry defined special health care needs as “any physical, developmental, mental, sensory, behavioral, cognitive, or emotional impairment or limiting condition that requires medical management, health care intervention, and/or use of specialized services or programs.”. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological behavioral management is used to perform oral health care safely and efficiently. However, the choice of the ideal behavioral technique by a skilful practitioner must be customized after fully understanding the cognitive, social, and emotional qualities of the child. Therefore, we have presented this case report that highlights the dental and behavioral management of a 9-year-old child who was diagnosed recently with autoimmune encephalitis, seizure disorder, and psychosis. C ASE D ESCRIPTION. MEDICAL HISTORY. This 9-year-old child was diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, seizure disorder, and psychosis. Seizure semiology was described as eye blinking, and the child was usually not conscious during the attack with no response to a stimulus. Seizure is absorbed by itself and associated with a post-sleeping attack which lasts for minutes. The child was born in 2012 full-term healthy child with no medical problems. In 2015, diagnosed with otitis media effusion, and he was scheduled for adenotonsillectomy. In 2020, after 5 years postsurgery, the mother reported a fever reaching 38.5 degrees requiring antipyretic drugs. He was diagnosed with an ear infection and treated with antibiotics for two days. After a few days, while he was sleeping the mother noticed abnormal movement in form of a generalized tonic colonic seizure lasting for one minute associated with salivation and post-ictal sleepiness. The parent took the child to the emergency department at King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz University Hospital and he had several attacks which had been managed using Keppra. Diagnostic investigations involved lumber puncture under general anesthesia which resulted in negative NMDA. Other diagnostic investigations included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which was normal and electroencephalographic which showed normal findings. Finally, a neurologist diagnosed him with autoimmune encephalitis. The child was treated with several medications to control seizures including keppra, tegretol, and topamax. Additionally, he is on escitalopram for the treatment of psychosis. Table 1 shows the oral side effects of the anti-seizures and anti psychosis medications that this child is using. A consultation with the pediatric neurologist and psychiatrist to check the patient's medical and psychological status and the child was cleared by the pediatric neurologist and psychiatrist. No contraindications for dental treatment under local anesthesia. Therefore, it was concluded that we proceed with dental treatment. DENTAL HISTORY AND EXAMINATION. This is the first dental visit for the child. Intraorally, there was a gingival recession related to the lower anterior incisor (Fig. 1). Hard-tissue intraoral examination showed mixed dentition with multiple occlusal and proximal caries, rotated #16, anterior crossbite in #11,31, #21,41, and posterior crossbite #16,46 (Fig. 1).

37551430,"A dual role for the chromatin reader ORCA/LRWD1 in targeting the origin recognition complex to chromatin. Eukaryotic cells use chromatin marks to regulate the initiation of DNA replication. The origin recognition complex (ORC)-associated protein ORCA plays a critical role in heterochromatin replication in mammalian cells by recruiting the initiator ORC, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structures of ORCA in complex with ORC's Orc2 subunit and nucleosomes, establishing that ORCA orchestrates ternary complex assembly by simultaneously recognizing a highly conserved peptide sequence in Orc2, nucleosomal DNA, and repressive histone trimethylation marks through an aromatic cage. Unexpectedly, binding of ORCA to nucleosomes prevents chromatin array compaction in a manner that relies on H4K20 trimethylation, a histone modification critical for heterochromatin replication. We further show that ORCA is necessary and sufficient to specifically recruit ORC into chromatin condensates marked by H4K20 trimethylation, providing a paradigm for studying replication initiation in specific chromatin contexts. Collectively, our findings support a model in which ORCA not only serves as a platform for ORC recruitment to nucleosomes bearing specific histone marks but also helps establish a local chromatin environment conducive to subsequent MCM2-7 loading.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,6279,pos_MEDLINE,0.99746394,1
37578046,"Computational exploration of natural compounds targeting Staphylococcus aureus: inhibiting AgrA promoter binding for antimicrobial intervention. Staphylococcus aureus is a highly virulent nosocomial pathogen that poses a significant threat to individuals exposed to healthcare settings. Due to its sophisticated machinery for producing virulence factors, S. aureus can cause severe and potentially fatal infections in humans. This study focuses on the response regulator AgrA, which plays a crucial role in regulating the production of virulence factors in S. aureus. The objective is to identify natural compounds that can inhibit the binding of AgrA to its promoter site, thus inhibiting the expression of virulence genes. To achieve this, a pharmacophore model was generated using known drugs and applied to screen the ZINC natural product database. The resulting compounds were subjected to molecular docking-based virtual screening against the C-terminal DNA binding domain of AgrA. Three compounds, namely ZINC000077269178, ZINC000051012304, and ZINC000004266026, were shortlisted based on their strong affinity for key residues involved in DNA binding and transcription initiation. Subsequently, the unbound and ligand-bound complexes were subjected to a 200 ns molecular dynamics simulation to assess their conformational stability. Various analyses, including RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, Principal Component Analysis, and Gibbs free energy landscape, were conducted on the simulation trajectory. The RMSD profile indicated similar fluctuations in both bound and unbound structures, while the Rg profile demonstrated the compactness of the protein without any unfolding during the simulation. Furthermore, Principal component analysis revealed that ligand binding reduced the overall atomic motion of the protein whereas free energy landscape suggested the energy variations obtained in complexes.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

37634858,"A molecular dynamics study of cell-penetrating peptide transportan-10 (TP10): Binding, folding and insertion to transmembrane state in zwitterionic membrane. Transportan 10 (TP10) is a 21-residue, cationic, α-helical cell-penetrating peptide that can be used as a delivery vector for various bioactive molecules. Based on recent confocal microscopy studies, it is believed that TP10 can translocate across neutral lipid membrane passively, possibly as a monomer, without the formation of permanent pore. Here, we performed extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of TP10W (Y3W variant of TP10) to find the microscopic details of binding, folding and insertion of TP10W to transmembrane state in POPC bilayer. Binding study with CHARMM36 force field showed that TP10W initially binds to the membrane surface in unstructured configuration, but it spontaneously folds into α-helical conformation under the lipid head groups. Further insertion of TP10W, changing from a surface bound state to a vertically oriented transmembrane state, was investigated via umbrella simulations. The resulting free energy profile shows a relatively small barrier between two states, suggesting a possible translocation pathway as a monomer. In fact, unbiased simulation of transmembrane TP10W revealed how a charged Lys side chain can move from one leaflet to the other without a significant free energy cost. Finally, we compared the results of TP10W simulations with those of point mutated variants (TP10W-K12A18 and TP10W-K19L) to understand the effect of charge distribution on the peptide. It was observed that such a conservative mutation can cause noticeable changes in the conformations of both surface bound and transmembrane states.

37724427,"Cross-modal exposure restores multisensory enhancement after hemianopia. Hemianopia is a common consequence of unilateral damage to visual cortex that manifests as a profound blindness in contralesional space. A noninvasive cross-modal (visual-auditory) exposure paradigm has been developed in an animal model to ameliorate this disorder. Repeated stimulation of a visual-auditory stimulus restores overt responses to visual stimuli in the blinded hemifield. It is believed to accomplish this by enhancing the visual sensitivity of circuits remaining after a lesion of visual cortex; in particular, circuits involving the multisensory neurons of the superior colliculus. Neurons in this midbrain structure are known to integrate spatiotemporally congruent visual and auditory signals to amplify their responses, which, in turn, enhances behavioral performance. Here we evaluated the relationship between the rehabilitation of hemianopia and this process of multisensory integration. Induction of hemianopia also eliminated multisensory enhancement in the blinded hemifield. Both vision and multisensory enhancement rapidly recovered with the rehabilitative cross-modal exposures. However, although both reached pre-lesion levels at similar rates, they did so with different spatial patterns. The results suggest that the capability for multisensory integration and enhancement is not a pre-requisite for visual recovery in hemianopia, and that the underlying mechanisms for recovery may be more complex than currently appreciated.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,6312,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.002199798,0
37738963,"Implications of a multiscale structure of the yeast nuclear pore complex. SUMMARY. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) direct the nucleocytoplasmic transport of macromolecules. Here, we provide a composite multiscale structure of the yeast NPC, based on improved 3D density maps from cryogenic electron microscopy and AlphaFold2 models. Key features of the inner and outer rings were integrated into a comprehensive model. We resolved flexible connectors that tie together the core scaffold, along with equatorial transmembrane complexes and a lumenal ring that anchor this channel within the pore membrane. The organization of the nuclear double outer ring reveals an architecture that may be shared with ancestral NPCs. Additional connections between the core scaffold and the central transporter suggest that under certain conditions, a degree of local organization is present at the periphery of the transport machinery. These connectors may couple conformational changes in the scaffold to the central transporter to modulate transport. Collectively, this analysis provides insights into assembly, transport, and NPC evolution. INTRODUCTION. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) form a gateway between the cytoplasm and nucleus for the bidirectional transport of macro-molecules during cell growth, differentiation, and development. However, an understanding of NPC function and its transport mechanism remains incomplete, due in part to the lack of a high-resolution structure. Such a structure will provide insights into the hierarchical assembly of nucleoporins (Nups), conformational plasticity of the scaffold, and membrane association. This approach may also illuminate the central transport machinery. In addition, an improved structural model should deliver a framework for understanding the role of NPCs in aging, infectious disease, and cancer. The canonical NPC from baker’s yeast has a mass of ~52 MDa, spanning a pore in the nuclear envelope (NE). This channel comprises ~30 distinct Nups (~550 in total) arranged as 8 spokes in the inner ring (IR), flanked by single cytoplasmic and nuclear outer rings comprising Y-shaped Nup84 complexes. However, multiple isoforms are present in yeast cells, including a subset with a double outer ring on the nuclear side. In addition, a basket functions as a nuclear RNA export platform and is roughly co-linear with Nup82 complexes on the cytoplasmic outer ring (CR); together, these form the core of an RNA remodeling and export machine. The yeast NPC is tethered to the NE by membrane anchors in the IR. Nup84 Y-complexes in the outer rings contribute additional membrane binding motifs (MBMs) and may interact with the transmembrane domain (TMD) of Ndc1. In addition, a pore membrane protein (Pom152) has an extended C-terminal domain (CTD) with tandem repeats of Ig-like domains; 2 copies are anchored to each spoke, and 16 copies form a lumenal ring (LR) in the NE lumen. Flexible termini of ~10 different FG Nups with FXFG or GLFG repeats are anchored to the core scaffold and extend into the central channel, where they provide binding sites for transport factors and cargo complexes to facilitate transport—together, these form the central transporter. The NPC has been analyzed by cryogenic electron tomography (CET) and sub-volume averaging for human, frog, algal, and yeast complexes, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The core scaffold in these structures ranges from ~12 to 30 Å resolution, and molecular models have pinpointed the position and relative orientation of many Nups. Moreover, Artificial-intelligence-based structure prediction programs are able to leverage structures in the Protein Data Bank and per-residue correlations in sequence alignments to provide computed structure models (CSMs). Nup crystal structures, CSMs, and homology models can be used to model the NPC with electron density maps from CET or single-particle analysis, in concert with other data, such as chemical cross-links. Recent CET studies of the S. pombe NPC have shown that the core scaffold undergoes a large radial expansion of the IR with smaller displacements of the outer rings to upregulate trans-port. Similar expanded NPC conformations have been observed in other organisms. Current single-particle density maps of isolated yeast and vertebrate NPCs span a range from nanometer to near-atomic resolution for sub-assemblies of the core scaffold and have revealed a radially contracted NPC with a smaller diameter central channel. In this study, improved 3D density maps from the S. cerevisiae NPC were combined with flexible fitting of AlphaFold2 models to obtain a composite multiscale structure that provides insights into this remarkable channel. RESULTS. OVERVIEW. Yeast cells lack a nuclear lamina that allows intact NPCs to be released from the NE with mild detergent extraction of a cell cryolysate and purified with a single affinity step. However, the large size and flexibility of the NPC presents a formidable challenge to structure determination. Low-resolution 3D density maps can facilitate the integration of information from higher-resolution analysis of sub-assemblies and other sources. We adopted a multiscale approach in which individual ring systems were refined at 17–30 Å resolution to give a better representation of their connectivity within the NPC (Figures S1A and S1B, left-hand panels). This allowed the identification of additional spoke connectors, orphan Nup densities in the double outer ring, linker domains between the inner and outer double rings, and FG connectors to the central transporter. We took advantage of the fact that yeast NPCs with nuclear double outer rings (NRs) (form II, 15%–20%) are more amenable to electron microscopy (EM) structural determination for certain sub-assemblies than canonical form I channels with single rings on both sides of the IR. Improved density maps for the spoke and double Y-complexes (Figure S2A; Table S1; STAR Methods) allowed us to increase the precision and extent of our previous NPC structure by incorpor",PMC,pos,1,pos,6319,pos_PMC,0.99678373,1

37805510,"Open structure and gating of the Arabidopsis mechanosensitive ion channel MSL10. INTRODUCTION. During growth and development, plants constantly experience a wide variety of exogenous and endogenous mechanical stress such as touch, gravity, wind, flood, wound, pathogen invasion, and osmotic pressure. One way to perceive and respond to these mechanical cues is to engage mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels to convert force into electrical and chemical signals. Carnivorous plants, such as the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula), involve MS channels in the sensory hairs on the leaf blade to sense the touch of prey and elicit action potentials, eventually leading to rapid leaf closure. An array of MS channels, including two-pore potassium, OSCA, Piezo, MCA, and MSL channels, have been identified in plants to perform specialized physiological functions. Remarkably, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, ten distinct MSL channels (MSL1-10), which are homologous to the prokaryotic mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS), are expressed in different tissues and cellular compartments. For instance, MSL1, MSL2, and MSL8 have been found to localize to the mitochondria, chloroplast, and pollen membranes, respectively. MSL1 has been proposed to regulate the membrane potential and control redox homeostasis under abiotic stress in mitochondria, whereas MSL8 critically manages osmotic stress in pollen hydration and germination. Amongst the Arabidopsis MSL channels, MSL10 is enigmatic in that it has two separable functional modalities, regulated cell death signaling conferred by its N-terminal soluble ‘death’ domain and force-activated ion channel activity imparted by its C-terminal portion. When heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, MSL10 is indeed activated by membrane stretch and displays a preference for anions. In Arabidopsis, MSL10 is primarily expressed in the shoot apex, root tips, and vascular tissues, playing a critical role in adaptation to hypo-osmotic shock and induction of programmed cell death. Moreover, recent studies have suggested that MSL10 participates in wound signaling and perception of mechanical oscillations caused by the wind. On the protein sequence level, MSL10 is closely related to MSL9 (75% sequence identity) and forms heteromeric channels with MSL9 in the wild-type plant. In addition, MSL10 is homologous to Flycatcher1 (DmMSL10/FLYC1, 48% sequence identity), a recently identified MS ion channel involved in prey recognition in the Venus flytrap. To better understand MS channels pivotal for plant physiology, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the wild-type MSL10 channel from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtMSL10) as well as its functional mutants. Strikingly, an open structure of the wild-type channel solubilized in detergent micelles or embedded in lipid nanodiscs is achieved in the absence of applied force. By comparison, the structure of an inactive variant reveals how the ion conduction path can be potentially closed by side chain reorientation of a gating phenylalanine residue, without global structural rearrangements of the channel. RESULTS. OVERALL STRUCTURE. We expressed the full-length wild-type AtMSL10 channel, consisting of 734 amino acids, in Pichia pastoris and purified the channel to homogeneity for single-particle cryo-EM analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). We obtained 3D reconstruction at a nominal resolution of ~3.7 Å, with C7 symmetry applied (Fig. 1a), built an atomic model facilitated by the AlphaFold prediction of a protomer, and refined the structure to good stereochemistry (Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 1). The channel core, consisting of TM3-TM6 and the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, was well resolved in the cryo-EM density map and allowed unambiguous placement of most of the side chains. However, the N-terminal ‘death’ domain (residues 1–165), part of the cytoplasmic domain between TM4 and TM5, including residues 335–386, 397–431, and 469–480, and the C-terminal end (residues 732–734), were not resolved in the reconstruction, and thus were absent in the final refined atomic model. The linker domain between TM4 and TM5 and most of the residues in the peripheral TM1–TM2 helices were modeled as poly-alanine because of weak side-chain densities. AtMSL10 assembles as a symmetric heptamer in that the cryo-EM reconstructions without applied symmetry (C1 symmetry) and with imposed C7 symmetry are essentially identical. The overall architecture shows similarity to other MscS homologs (Fig. 2a), including E. coli MscS (EcMscS), YnaI, MscK, and A. thaliana MSL1 (AtMSL1), and most closely resembles that of the Venus flytrap DmMSL10/FLYC1. Analogous to DmMSL10/FLYC1, each subunit of the heptameric AtMSL10 channel is composed of a transmembrane domain (TMD) with six membrane-spanning helices (TM1-TM6) and a characteristic C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (CTD) shared by all MscS homologs (Figs. 1, 2a). Other structural features common for MscS homologs, including a sharply kinked pore-lining helix (TM6a and TM6b), nearly single-file arrangement of the transmembrane helices, and side portals in the cytoplasmic CTD critical for ion permeability and conduction, are also present in AtMSL10 (Figs. 1, 2a). Notably, the arrangement of TMDs creates large cavities between adjacent subunits (Fig. 1a), which are presumably filled with lipid molecules in a biological membrane. The relaxed inter-subunit packing of TMDs seems to be an additionally shared structural feature amongst MscS homologs including MSL1, MscK, and DmMSL10/FLYC1. The AtMSL10 structure also reveals a cytoplasmic linker domain (CLD) connecting TM4 and TM5, analogous to that observed in DmMSL10/FLYC1 (Fig. 2). The seven CLDs loosely encompass the central cytoplasmic cage, making marginal contacts with the remaining of the channel. Densities corresponding to the peripheral CLDs are less well-resolved in the cryo-EM reconstruction compared with densities of the channel core, indicating dynamic nature of the CLDs.

Newly synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are sorted by coat protein complex II (COPII) at the ER exit site en route to the Golgi. Under cellular stresses, COPII proteins become targets of regulation to control the transport. Here, we show that the COPII outer coat proteins Sec31 and Sec13 are selectively sequestered into the biomolecular condensate of SCOTIN/SHISA-5, which interferes with COPII vesicle formation and inhibits ER-to-Golgi transport. SCOTIN is an ER transmembrane protein with a cytosolic intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which is required and essential for the formation of condensates. Upon IFN-γ stimulation, which is a cellular condition that induces SCOTIN expression and condensation, ER-to-Golgi transport was inhibited in a SCOTIN-dependent manner. Furthermore, cancer-associated mutations of SCOTIN perturb its ability to form condensates and control transport. Together, we propose that SCOTIN impedes the ER-to-Golgi transport through its ability to form biomolecular condensates at the ER membrane.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,6337,pos_MEDLINE,0.9977083,1
37836757,"In Silico Studies of Four Compounds of Cecropia obtusifolia against Malaria Parasite. 1. INTRODUCTION. Malaria is a disease that affects many people worldwide but mainly newborns, children under five years of age, pregnant women, travelers, and people with a compromised immune system are at risk of developing a major infection [1]. It is a disease caused by the bite of a female mosquito of the genus Anopheles spp. which requires feeding for reproduction; the infection of this disease causes symptoms such as fevers, headache, and chills, symptoms that can be implicated in fatigue, confusion, seizures, shortness of breath, anemia, coma, and death [1,2]. In 2021, half of the world’s population was at risk of malaria and during the same year, there were 247 million cases and 619,000 deaths mainly in the African region where the incidence is 232.8 (cases per 1000 people at risk) [2]. P. vivax is the second most studied species, only below P. falciparum due to the severity of the disease it causes and its wide distribution; in Central America alone, P. vivax is the etiologic agent of 95% of diagnosed malaria cases and in the region of the Americas the incidence is 4.6. Some standardized treatments to combat this disease have been generating resistance due to bad practice or continuous use. Many of the current drugs have been developed by the use of plants in a traditional way and by studies of some compounds present in the species with some activity, such as some flavonoids of plant species that have been described with antimalarial potential, although many more are unknown [3,4,5]. In Mexico, malaria remains endemic in states like Chiapas and Chihuahua where several communities are affected year after year [6]. Cecropia obtusifolia is a perennial tree distributed from Mexico to Brazil, that has been extensively studied for its pharmacological properties and use in the treatment of chronic diseases [7,8,9]. These properties have been attributed to the presence of active compounds such as flavonoids, proantho-cyanins, terpenoids, steroids, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, storminous acid, and isoorientin [10,11,12], among others, primarily found in the leaves, bark, stem, flower, bud, and root of these plants [13]. Recently, this species has been attributed to moderate antiplasmodial effects, which could promote its use for the treatment of malaria [14], an infectious disease caused by the Plasmodium spp. parasite and transmitted to humans by the Anopheles spp. vector. To date, no studies have evaluated the potential antimalarial activity of some compounds of Cecropia obtusifolia. On the other hand, some of the most targeted molecular or therapeutic sites in the search for antimalarial drugs are the proteins 2BL9, 4ZL4, and 1CET. The protein 2BL9, or dihydrofolate reductase protein of Plasmodium vivax, is a crucial target in the development of new antimalarial agents [15,16] such as pyrimentamine, a treatment for the elimination of protozoa like plasmodium or toxoplasmosis [17]. Similarly, the protein 4ZL4 belongs to the aspartyl protease known as plasmepsin V of P. vivax and it is the site of action of synthetically formulated compounds to combat malaria such as WEHI-842 [12,18,19,20]. Lastly, the protein 1CET is associated with the Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase cofactor binding site, which is the main binding and action site for chloroquine, one of the most widely used drugs to treat malaria [19,21,22]. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the potential antimalarial activity of the metabolites identified formerly in C. obtusifolia through in silico analysis, as well as to assess their pharmacokinetic properties. 2. RESULTS. 2.1. COMPOUNDS OF CECROPIA OBTUSIFOLIA. Due to some background in the use of flavonoids from other species with potential antimalarial activity, it was decided to work with flavonoids such as chrysin, isoorientin, and triterpenes such as ursolic acid and α-amyrin present in this species Figure 1. 2.2. MOLECULAR DOCKING. Molecular docking analysis was performed to assess the interaction capacity between the target proteins and the compounds found in C. obtusifolia, using Autodock Vina to calculate the binding energy. The three target proteins used were 2BL9, 4ZL4, and 1CET, which play a key role in malaria treatment and have known binding sites in their crystalline structures (found in the .pdb file) with a 25 Å grid. The binding energy of all compounds was below −7.7 kcal/mol, as shown in Table 1. The best complexes between the ligands and target were chrysin–2BL9 (−8.7 kcal/mol), chrysin–4ZL4 (−9.6 kcal/mol) and isoorientin–1CET (−9.1 kcal/mol). In fact, almost all the evaluated ligands exhibited higher affinities than the co-crystallized ligands in the re-docking, except for ursolic acid with 4ZL4 (−7.8 kcal/mol) compared to Wehi (−8.2 kcal/mol). Figure 2 illustrates the binding site and orientation pose of these three complexes. The interactions formed between these compounds and the target proteins were visualized using PyMOL 2.5.4 and LigPlot 2.2.5. Chrysin was found to form hydrophobic interactions with Ile13, Cys14, Ala15, Asp53, Tyr56, Phe57, Ser120, Ile121, Ile173, Gly174, and Gly175 and hydrogen bond with Ser117 (3.03 Å) from the 2BL9 target. Chrysin also exhibited hydrophobic interactions with Tyr27, Ile46, Tyr107, Cys108, Leu147, Phe148, Gln151, Val156, and Gly283, along with two hydrogen bonds with Asp48 (2.77 Å) and Glu109 (3.06 Å) from 4ZL4. Isoorientin demonstrated hydrophobic interactions with Gly11, Ser12, Gly13, Met14, Ile36, Met40, Ala80, Phe82, and Lys104 as well as five hydrogen bonds with Asp35 (3.16 Å), Gly81 (2.91 Å), Thr83 (3.24 Å), and Glu108 (2.69 Å) from 1CET. Overall, chrysin showed the strongest binding affinity for both 2BL9 and 4ZL4. Its interaction with 2BL9 involved residues Cys14, Ala15, Asp53, Phe57, Ile173, and Tyr179 which coincide with pyrimethamine. In contrast, its interaction with 4ZL4 only aligned with a Wehi-binding residue (Asp48). The high affinity of chrysin for these two re",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,6340,far_neg_PMC,0.005291605,0

Recently, high-throughput quantum cascade laser-based vibrational circular dichroism (QCL-VCD) technology has reduced the measurement time for high-quality vibrational circular dichroism spectra from hours to a few minutes. This study evaluates QCL-VCD for chiral monitoring using flow-through measurement of a changing sample in a circulating loop. A balanced detection QCL-VCD system was applied to the enantiomeric pair R/S-1,1'-bi-2-naphthol in solution. Different mixtures of the two components were used to simulate a racemization process, collecting spectral data at a time resolution of 6 min, and over three concentration levels. The goal of this experimental setup was to evaluate QCL-VCD in terms of both molar and enantiomeric excess (EE) sensitivity at a time resolution relevant to chiral monitoring in chemical processes. Subsequent chemometric evaluation by partial least squares regression revealed a cross-validated prediction accuracy of 2.8% EE with a robust prediction also for the test data set (error = 3.5% EE). In addition, the data set was also treated with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), which also achieved a robust prediction. Due to the operating principle of LASSO, the obtained coefficients constituted a few discrete spectral frequencies, which represent the most variance. This information can be used in the future for dedicated QCL-based instrument design, gaining a higher time resolution without sacrificing predictive capabilities.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,6341,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0022606407,0
37870073,"pH-Responsive swimming behavior of light-powered rod-shaped micromotors. Micromotors have emerged as promising devices for a wide range of applications e.g., microfluidics, lab-on-a-chip devices, active matter, environmental monitoring, etc. The control over the activity of micromotors with the ability to exhibit multimode swimming is one of the most desirable features for many of the applications. Here, we demonstrate a rod-shaped light-driven micromotor whose activity and swimming behavior can easily be controlled. The rod-shaped micromotors are fabricated through the dynamic shadowing growth (DSG) technique, where a 2 μm long arm of titanium dioxide (TiO2) is grown over spherical silica (SiO2) particles (1 μm diameter). Under low-intensity UV light exposure, the micromotors exhibit self-propulsion in an aqueous peroxide medium. When activated, the swimming behavior of micromotors greatly depends on the pH of the medium. The swimming direction, i.e., forward or backward movement, as well as swimming modes like translational or rotational motion, can be controlled by changing the pH values. The observed dynamics has been rationalized using a theoretical model incorporating chemical activity, hydrodynamic flow, and the effect of gravity for a rod-shaped active particle near a planar wall. The pH-dependent translational and rotational dynamics of micromotors provide a versatile platform for achieving controlled and responsive behaviors. Continued research and development in this area hold great promise for advancing micromotors and enabling novel applications in microfluidics, micromachining, environmental sciences, and biomedicine.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,6345,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.002070827,0

Hydrostatic pressure can reversibly modulate protein-protein and protein-chromophore interactions of C-phycocyanin (C-PC) from Spirulina platensis. Small-angle X-ray scattering combined with UV-Vis spectrophotometry and protein modeling was used to explore the color and structural changes of C-PC under high pressure conditions at different pH levels. It was revealed that pressures up to 350 MPa were enough to fully disassemble C-PC from trimers to monomers at pH 7.0, or from monomers to detached subunits at pH 9.0. These disassemblies were accompanied by protein unfolding that caused these high-pressure induced structures to be more extended. These changes were reversible following depressurization. The trimer-to-monomer transition proceeded through a collection of previously unrecognized, L-shaped intermediates resembling C-PC dimers. Additionally, pressurized C-PC showed decayed Q-band absorption and fortified Soret-band absorption. This was evidence that the folded tetrapyrroles, which had folded at ambient pressure, formed semicyclic unfolded conformations at a high pressure. Upon depressurization, the peak intensity and shift all recovered stepwise, showing pressure can precisely manipulate C-PC's structure as well as its color. Overall, a protein-chromophore regulatory theory of C-PC was unveiled.

37922785,"Crystal structure of the in-cell Cry1Aa purified from Bacillus thuringiensis. In-cell protein crystals which spontaneously crystallize in living cells, have recently been analyzed in investigations of their structures and biological functions. The crystals have been challenging to analyze structurally because of their small size. Therefore, the number of in-cell protein crystals in which the native structure has been determined is limited because most of the structures of in-cell crystals have been determined by recrystallization after dissolution. Some proteins have been reported to form intermolecular disulfide bonds in natural protein crystals that stabilize the crystals. Here, we focus on Cry1Aa, a cysteine-rich protein that crystallizes in Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and forms disulfide bonds. Previously, the full-length structure of 135 kDa Cry1Ac, which is the same size as Cry1Aa, was determined by recrystallization of dissolved protein from crystals purified from Bt cells. However, the formation of disulfide bonds has not been investigated because it was necessary to replace cysteine residues to prevent aggregation of the soluble protein.

Different chemical topologies result in differing geometrical sizes of the unfolded proteins due to constraints in torsional rotations in cyclic domains. By introducing new topological indices, such as the chain-length-normalized collision cross-section (CCS) and the maximum charge state (zM ) in the extensively unfolded state, we were able to successfully differentiate various protein chemical topologies, including linear chains, ring-containing topologies (lasso, tadpole, multicyclics, etc.), and mechanically interlocked rings, like catenanes.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6354,neg_MEDLINE,0.0019684948,0
37939088,"The structural basis of mRNA recognition and binding by yeast pseudouridine synthase PUS1. INTRODUCTION. The cellular transcriptome throughout all domains of life displays a highly complex regulatory network of more than 150 known post-transcriptional RNA modifications that modulate RNA biogenesis, function, specificity, and stability [1–3]. Pseudouridine (Ψ), a C5-glycosidic isomer of uridine, was discovered in 1951 and soon after termed the fifth nucleoside [4–6]. Almost 20 years later, the first pseudouridine synthase gene, TruA, was identified, and found to modify tRNA in bacteria [7, 8]. More recent advances in transcriptome-wide mapping of Ψ revealed widespread pseudouridylation of mRNAs in eukaryotes at levels comparable to N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications [9–14]. Despite the abundance of Ψ in mRNA, little is known about a) the purpose of that modification, b) whether the location of pseudouridine modifications in mRNA is random or if they are of functional importance, and c) whether they are installed by specific PUS enzymes. Two unique classes of pseudouridine synthase enzymes, that are jointly responsible for pseudouridylation of RNA, differ in the way that they target their RNA substrates. Guide RNA-dependent PUS enzymes in eukaryotes and archaea (such as Cbf5 in yeast and dyskerin in humans) are part of a box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex (so named based on two closely related sequence elements in the guide RNA called “box H” and “box ACA"") that utilize small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) as guides that recognize and base-pair with its substrates, which are mostly non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) [15]. Alternatively, an RNA recognition mechanism that does not rely on guide RNA factors is employed by stand-alone PUS enzymes that independently recognize and modify their targets (reviewed in [16]). In contrast to the H/ACA snoRNP PUS enzymes, most stand-alone PUS enzymes are conserved throughout eukaryotes and bacteria. These PUS enzymes are further divided into six families, which differ in N- or C-terminal extensions flanking a conserved catalytic core domain. That domain is present in all H/ACA snoRNP and stand-alone PUS enzymes and contains a central catalytic motif corresponding to an antiparallel β-sheet that is flanked by α-helices [17, 18]. A strictly conserved catalytic aspartate residue in that motif is required for the rearrangement of uridine to its C-glycoside isomer Ψ in a mechanism that is not yet clear [19, 20]. Eukaryotes generally contain multiple unique stand-alone PUS enzymes (PUS1-PUS10 and mitochondrial RPUSD), which differ in their substrate preference and localization in the cell. Each of them modifies specific sites in tRNAs, snRNAs, and rRNAs by targeting a sequence and/or structural element in their respective substrates [16, 20]. The crystal structures of many PUS enzymes have been solved, including structures of eukaryotic/archaeal box H/ACA snoRNPs with guide and substrate RNAs [21–28] and several bacterial stand-alone PUS enzymes bound to non-coding RNAs, most of them revealing specific interactions of PUS enzymes with their respective targets [29–32]. It remains somewhat unclear which PUS enzymes are responsible for the pseudouridylation of messenger RNA (mRNA). Various studies have indicated that more than half of the Ψ modifications in mRNA are catalyzed by the tRNA-specific PUS4 (a member of the divergent TruB family of PUS enzymes) and PUS7 (TruD family) through recognition of tRNA-like structures (which are their reported primary targets [10, 12–14]. Like PUS7, PUS1 (TruA family) has been reported to modify multiple structurally diverse positions in tRNA, U2 and U6 snRNAs, suggesting less restricted selection of its RNA targets by these enzymes compared to PUS4 [33–36]. More recent data have suggested that PUS1 is the predominant PUS to modify uridines in mRNA [36–39]. Although PUS1 sites in mRNA show little sequence similarity, high-throughput pseudouridylation studies have implicated a structure-dependent mRNA target recognition mechanism and suggested that modulation of the RNA structure may play a role in the regulation of mRNA pseudouridylation [14, 40]. However, it is still unclear how a tRNA-specific pseudouridine synthase recognizes and modifies mRNA substrates, mostly due to the lack of available structural information of PUS1 enzymes bound to mRNA targets. Only a few structures of eukaryotic stand-alone PUS enzymes have been solved: the catalytic domains of human PUS1 and PUS10 [41–43], as well as structures of human and yeast PUS7 [44, 45]. The only available structural information of a stand-alone PUS enzyme bound to its target RNA are the structures of E. coli TruA (the closest bacterial homologue of PUS1) and TruB, each bound to tRNA [30, 46]. Despite the structural similarities between TruA and PUS1, modeling and docking studies of tRNA and the core domain of human PUS1 suggests a significantly different orientation of the tRNA when bound to PUS1 than in the E. coli tRNA-TruA complex [41]. Because visualization of how PUS1 binds to mRNA might provide new insight into the basis of its action on such substrates, we generated a pair of crystal structures of wildtype S. cerevisiae PUS1 and a catalytically inactive PUS1 mutant in complex with short mRNA fragments. The structures, from two unrelated crystal forms, represent the first structures of a eukaryotic stand-alone PUS enzyme bound to a target RNA. The structures illustrate how PUS1 recognizes and binds a helical RNA duplex and enable the identification of RNA-contacting amino acid residues that make extensive contacts with each RNA strand to orient and guide the RNA into the active site of the enzyme. Additional examination and comparison with previously described structural and biochemical studies indicate that a) while PUS1 and TruA use the same protein surface to interact with their respective target-RNAs, the position and identity of the corresponding contact residues and the position of the bound RNAs differ significantly from one another, and b) PUS1 likely binds a",PMC,pos,1,pos,6355,pos_PMC,0.9972262,1
37993427,"Structure of the DDB1-AMBRA1 E3 ligase receptor complex linked to cell cycle regulation. INTRODUCTION. The two major intracellular protein degradation pathways in eukaryotic cells, autophagy and the ubiquitin‒proteasome system (UPS), are crucial to maintain cell homeostasis and the regulation of several cellular processes, including protein quality control, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Ubiquitin is a highly conserved protein that is most commonly attached to lysine residues in target proteins through the sequential action of ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) and ubiquitin ligases (E3). First, E1 activates the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction. The activated ubiquitin is then handed over to E2 and finally covalently attached to the substrate protein by E3 ubiquitin ligase. Proteins can be modified by the addition of a single ubiquitin (monoubiquitination) or a chain of multiple ubiquitin molecules (polyubiquitination), which signals the protein for degradation by proteosomes. Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) are the largest E3 ligase family in eukaryotes and are organized by a scaffold protein Cullin and a catalytic RING subunit, RBX1 or RBX2. Damage-specific DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1) is a component of the Cullin4A/B-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) complex and functions as an adaptor protein between Cullin4A/B (CUL4A/B) and CUL4A-associated factors (DCAFs) to target substrates for ubiquitination. DDB1 has triple β-propeller (BPA, BPB and BPC) domains and can associate with diverse substrate receptors, which in turn recruit substrates. AMBRA1 (activating molecule in Beclin-1 regulated autophagy) is one of the DCAF substrate receptors that plays a central role in the communication between autophagy, cell-cycle control and the UPS. AMBRA1 can regulate autophagy at several stages. Under starvation conditions, AMBRA1 promotes the ubiquitination of the serine/threonine kinase ULK1 (Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase-1) by the E3 ligase TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6). ULK1 is a component of the multi-subunit ULK complex and is essential for the induction of autophagy. Such ubiquitination results in ULK1 self-association, activation and autophagy initiation. In nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) phosphorylates AMBRA1 on Ser-52, resulting in the termination of the autophagy response by preventing ULK1 ubiquitination. In addition to promoting ULK1 ubiquitination, AMBRA1 functions as an E3 substrate receptor for Beclin1 ubiquitination during starvation-induced autophagy. Beclin1 is a component of the PI3KC3 (class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) complex together with Vps34 lipid kinase responsible for generating PI3P (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate). In this process, AMBRA1 promotes the Lys-63 ubiquitination of Beclin1. This modification enhances the interaction of Beclin1 with PI3KC3 and promotes the activation of Vps34, which is required for autophagy induction. Recently, AMBRA1 was identified as the major regulator of the stability of Cyclin D1, which is involved in regulating cell cycle progression. Cyclin D1 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) to drive cell proliferation by phosphorylating retinoblastoma protein Rb, which in turn dissociates from the E2F transcription factor, resulting in the expression of genes required for S-phase entry. AMBRA1 limits CDK4/6 activity by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of Cyclin D1 as part of the CRL4DDB1 E3 ligase complex. Loss of AMBRA1 leads to accumulation of Cyclin D1 and decreased sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, resulting in increased tumorigenic potential. Despite the centrality of AMBRA1 in the intersection of autophagy, the UPS and cell growth, the structure and regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the human DDB1-AMBRA1WD40 complex, which revealed a split WD40 domain formed by the N- and C-terminal AMBRA1 regions. HDX-MS analysis showed that the binding of DDB1 stabilizes distinct AMBRA1 regions, allowing for structural determination. The N-terminal helix-loop-helix motif of AMBRA1 is essential for DDB1 binding, and point mutations within this region abolish their interaction, prevent the ubiquitination of Cyclin D1 in vitro and increase cell cycle progression. Together, these results provide structural insights into the AMBRA1-ubiquitin ligase complex and suggest a mechanism by which AMBRA1 targets proteins involved in essential cell cycles and autophagy pathways. RESULTS. HYDROGEN-DEUTERIUM EXCHANGE ANALYSIS OF AMBRA1 DYNAMICS. A detailed picture of the mechanism by which AMBRA1 engages CRL4 is needed to provide new insight into AMBRA1 regulation, the relationship between autophagy, the UPS pathway and tumor growth, and for the development of novel therapeutics. We therefore set out to dissect the molecular basis of AMBRA1 recruitment to CRL4. AMBRA1 has been found to contain a WD40 domain in the N-terminal region, while the rest of the protein is proposed to consist of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) due to a lack of recognizable protein domains (Fig. 1a). Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) can be used to study changes in protein dynamics, binding and folding as well as IDRs or regions with altered conformations between different states. The accessibility of a backbone amide hydrogen is largely dependent on hydrogen bonding and local secondary structure, as well as solvent accessibility. Stably folded secondary structure elements such as α-helices or β-sheets incorporate deuterium to a lower degree than interconnecting loops or unstructured regions. To gain insight into the backbone flexibility of AMBRA1, purified full-length AMBRA1 was analyzed by HDX-MS (Fig. 1b–d). Experiments were carried out at six time points of amide hydrogen exchange (10, 30, 60, 300, 900, 1800 s). A total of 203 peptides covering 98.8% of the sequence were identified and quantified (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1). T",PMC,pos,1,pos,6370,pos_PMC,0.9966036,1
38059674,"Biophysical characterization of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein's N-terminal domain. 1. INTRODUCTION. With more than 200 million cases and more than half a million deaths annually, malaria remains a major global health threat (WHO, 2022). This devastating disease is caused by parasites of the Plasmodium genus, which are injected in their sporozoite (SPZ) form in the host skin by infected female Anopheles mosquitoes probing for blood. From their inoculation site, the SPZs travel to the liver using their specialized migratory machinery, where they differentiate into merozoites to initiate the blood stage of the infection that causes the notorious malaria pathology (Cowman et al., 2016). Upon arrival in the liver sinusoids, SPZs interact with highly‐sulfated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HS‐HSPGs) presented by hepatic cells (Coppi et al., 2007, 2011; Pinzon‐Ortiz et al., 2001). This specific interaction is governed by the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the SPZ's major surface antigen, which uniformly coats the parasite surface. Despite differences in both length and composition of CSP amino acid sequences from various Plasmodium species, all have a similar modular build‐up (Figure 1a) consisting of (i) an N‐terminal domain (CSPN) containing the conserved pentapeptide Region I, (ii) a highly flexible linker consisting of tandem repeats, (iii) a C‐terminal domain (CSPC) containing the conserved Region III and Region II+, and (iv) a C‐terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor providing a physical link to the parasite's plasma membrane (McCutchan et al., 1996). CSP plays a central role in SPZ immunobiology, in both the insect and vertebrate hosts (Aly et al., 2009). Within the latter, CSP has been described to (i) be essential for the recognition and invasion of host hepatocytes through interaction with liver‐specific HS‐HSPGs (Coppi et al., 2007; Pinzon‐Ortiz et al., 2001), (ii) constitute the immunodominant SPZ surface antigen (Kumar et al., 2006), (iii) possess both extra‐ and intracellular effector functions to dampen host inflammatory responses (Singh et al., 2007; Usynin et al., 2007), and (iv) form a shield around the SPZ to protect its plasma membrane against pore‐forming proteins during parasite migration in the skin (Aliprandini et al., 2018). Over the past decades, it has been documented that CSPN is involved in several CSP‐mediated events: it is required for correct SPZ localization to both the mosquito salivary glands (Myung et al., 2004) and the vertebrate hepatocytes (Coppi et al., 2011). The molecular mechanism underlying CSP‐mediated hepatocyte recognition long remained under debate as two conserved regions of CSP were proposed to contain the HS‐HSPG binding site: Region I within CSPN (Ancsin & Kisilevsky, 2004; Rathore et al., 2002) and Region II+ within CSPC (Gantt et al., 1997). However, more recent studies have demonstrated (i) the inability of CSPC to bind heparin (Doud et al., 2012) and (ii) the importance of a stretch of positively charged residues preceding Region I (Zhao et al., 2016). These findings support the model proposed by Coppi and colleagues, in which CSPN is the main contributor to the HS‐HSPG interaction, while CSPC is involved in further cell adhesion and invasion processes, which still remain to be fully elucidated (Coppi et al., 2011). CSPN is proteolytically cleaved within Region I upon HS‐HSPG binding, an event that is essential for productive SPZ invasion of hepatic cells (Coppi et al., 2011), making this region an interesting target for cross‐species anti‐malarial strategies. Indeed, studies with anti‐CSPN antibodies have shown that many target epitopes adjacent to or within Region I (Espinosa et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2021; Thai et al., 2020). However, divergent results have been obtained regarding the ability of these antibodies to bind native CSP on the SPZ surface and their protective efficacy in vitro and in vivo (Bongfen et al., 2009; Espinosa et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2021; Thai et al., 2020). In contrast to the known α‐thrombospondin type‐1 repeat (αTSR) structure of CSPC (Doud et al., 2012), the structural features of CSPN are less well understood. While some studies make reference to this domain's highly flexible/disordered nature (Kucharska, Binter, et al., 2022; Oyen et al., 2018; Thai et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2016), a thorough biophysical and structural characterization of CSPN is currently lacking. Here, we describe an alternative method for the recombinant production and purification of CSPN from Plasmodium falciparum (PfCSPN). In our strategy, we have replaced the repeat region between PfCSPN and PfCSPC by a truncated linker containing a protease cleavage site. The functionality and biological relevance of the final PfCSPN product are demonstrated by a multidisciplinary approach encompassing heparin affinity chromatography, isothermal titration calorimetry, and HepG2 binding assays. Our method provides a final yield of ~15 mg per liter of bacterial culture, thereby providing sufficient material for biophysical studies to probe the domain's structure–function relationship. Furthermore, the study encompasses in silico disorder and secondary structure predictions, in‐solution studies (AGF, DLS, CD spectroscopy, SAXS, and NMR spectroscopy) and MD simulations.

The highly flexible/disordered character of PfCSPN has been proposed in several publications (Kucharska, Binter, et al., 2022; Oyen et al., 2018; Thai et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2016). Indeed, several structure prediction tools support this statement (Figure 1b,c). Various intrinsic disorder predictors report a high overall tendency for disorder and an AlphaFold2‐based structure prediction is characterized by an obvious lack of tertiary structure.

38074684,"Structural characterization of human de novo protein NCYM and its complex with a newly identified DNA aptamer using atomic force microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering. 1. INTRODUCTION. NCYM, a cis-antisense gene of MYCN, encodes a Homininae-specific oncoprotein (1, 2). In human neuroblastomas, NCYM is always co-amplified with MYCN, and its expression level is associated with poor prognosis (1). NCYM stabilizes MYCN via inhibition of GSK3β, whereas MYCN stimulates both MYCN and NCYM transcription (1). This feedback loop contributes to the maintenance of high levels of both MYCN and NCYM expressions in MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas (1, 2). NCYM enhances the metastasis of neuroblastomas (1) possibly via inhibition of apoptotic cell death (1, 3, 4) and/or regulation of stemness (5, 6). Furthermore, NCYM has been shown to be associated with progression of adult cancers (2, 7). Therefore, NCYM is a promising target protein for anti-cancer therapy. However, the difficulty in determining its structure hinders drug design (8). NCYM is a newly evolved coding gene that originated from MYCN promoter region during the evolution of the Homininae (1, 2). New genes originating from non-genic regions are known as de novo gene birth (9–11), and NCYM is the first de novo gene product experimentally shown to have oncogenic functions. Owing to their de novo emergence, de novo proteins show no homology to known genes and do not have any domains or motifs. The amino acid sequence of de novo proteins is similar to a random sequence (12), although a recent report identified the difference between de novo proteins and unevolved random-sequence counterparts in that de novo proteins exhibit moderately higher solubility in cells (13). Four de novo proteins have been structurally characterized to date: Bsc4 (14), NCYM (8), Goddard (15), and AFGP8 (16); however, mainly because of their highly disordered nature, none of the complete structures have been determined. Upon binding to the ice surface, the local structure of the antifreeze glycoprotein AFGP8 make a transition from a disordered to an ordered state (16), indicating the possibility of significant ordering of de novo proteins via complex formation with binding partners. Consistent with an earlier prediction that NCYM binds to DNA (17), we have previously found that benzonase treatment significantly improves the solubility of NCYM (8). These observations led us to identify DNA aptamers that bind specifically to NCYM and to consider that analysis of the complex of NCYM and DNA aptamers may contribute to the characterization of the structural dynamics of NCYM. Here, three types of DNA aptamers were identified by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and their interactions with NCYM were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Moreover, the structure of the NCYM-DNA complex of a representative DNA aptamer (named “No. 1”), which enhances interaction between NCYM and GSK3β, was analyzed using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 2.1. APTAMER SELECTION PROCEDURE. SELEX was performed as previously reported with some modifications (18, 19). Dynabeads™ MyOne™ Carboxylic Acid (CA) magnetic beads (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) were used for NCYM solidification to segregate NCYM-binding DNA molecules from the non-binding molecules. The target beads were prepared by an amine coupling reaction using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and washed with the selection buffer [SB; 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20]. Briefly, the CA magnetic beads were washed twice with 500 μl of 100 mM 2-Morpholinoethanesulfonic acid mono hydrate (MES) buffer at pH 6.0. After added 50 μl of 100 mM MES buffer and 50 μl of EDC, and the mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The mixture was then mixed with 200 μg of NCYM in 100 mM MES buffer and incubated over night at room temperature to react with the amino group of NCYM and the carboxylic acid of the CA magnetic beads. Next, they were washed twice with 500 μl of PBST (0.1% Tween20 in phosphate buffered saline, PBS) and 500 μl of PBST-BSA (0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBST) was added. Before using the target beads, they were washed twice with 1 ml of SB. An initial single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) pool, 5′-GGAATGTGGTCCCTCGCAATAAATC-(N30)- GAAATGAGCCCTTTGACCCTGTAC-3′, containing 30 random nucleotides between forward (Fw) and revers (Rv) primer region was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Tokyo, Japan). The selection of aptamers was performed starting from 4.5 nmol of DNAs (~1015 molecules) in 100 μl of SB. The pool was mixed for 15 minutes with 250 μg of target beads at 25°C. The beads were then washed with SB, and the bound ssDNA was eluted with 7 M urea. After recovery of the eluted ssDNA using Rv primer beads, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with KOD Dash DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), a forward (Fw) primer (5’-GGAATGTGGTCCCTCGCAATAAATC-3’) and a reverse (Rv) primer (5’-GTACAGGGTCAAAGGGCTCATTTC-3’) with modification by the 5’-biotin. Next, the amplified double stranded DNA (dsDNA) was bound to MyOne SA C1 magnetic beads, and the Fw chain (ssDNA) was eluted with 0.02M NaOH. The ssDNA was used for the next round. After eight rounds of selection, the frequency of ssDNA sequences was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) from rounds 3 to 8 of SELEX using a MiniSeq System (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing data were preprocessed by using the program of PRINSEQ++ (20) and adopted above 99.9% of the base calling accuracy (Q score of 30 and above). 2.2. BIO-LAYER INTERFEROMETRY. All the Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) measurements were performed at 25°C using an Octet® RED96e system (Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany). All the samples were placed in a 96 well microplate and the sample volume was 200 μl/well. The microplate was shaked at 1,000 rpm during the measurement. As a ligand, each aptamer with 5’-biotin modification was immobilized on a",PMC,pos,1,pos,6387,pos_PMC,0.9971607,1
38114491,"A histone demethylase links the loss of plasticity to nongenetic inheritance and morphological change. INTRODUCTION. A trait’s development can shift from being environmentally sensitive (plastic) to insensitive (constitutive)—a process termed genetic assimilation—thereby fixing what was at first a conditionally expressed trait. Because both theory and empirical studies have linked assimilation to phenotypic diversification, the molecular details of plasticity’s loss should inform its potential evolutionary impacts. In principle, inference from cases of assimilation in nature could reveal the molecular mechanisms that mediate shifts in developmental plasticity and associated changes in morphology. The identification of such a mechanism would then allow functional tests of whether and how it drives change in a trait’s plasticity. Here, we infer and test such a mechanism in a family of nematodes (Diplogastridae) whose common ancestor had resource polyphenism, or discrete plasticity in its feeding morphology and niche use, with several lineages having lost the polyphenism independently (Fig. 1A). As a result, we (i) identify genes associated with loss of polyphenism using a combination of transcriptomic and comparative genomic analyses, (ii) functionally validate the role of a candidate gene in plastic development, and, motivated by the gene’s identity, (iii) test the possibility that the loss of its function allows a rapid response to selection. RESULTS. A SHARED SET OF GENES IS POLYPHENISM-BIASED ACROSS PRISTIONCHUS. In Diplogastridae, the origin of the polyphenism correlated with increased evolutionary rates for mouth morphology, with even higher rates following in lineages where plasticity was lost and a single morph assimilated. We hypothesized that, in this nematode family, genes whose expression was once polyphenism-biased should bear a signature of evolution (e.g., relaxed or positive selection) associated with plasticity’s loss. To test this idea, we first inferred a set of polyphenism-biased genes ancestral to a clade of >50 known species (the genus Pristionchus). For this inference, we identified genes whose expression is changed by the ablation of the polyphenism switch in two species representing an early divergence in that group. Our approach used genetic perturbations in common genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions, which allowed us to distinguish genes associated with the polyphenism per se from others whose expression might also be variously influenced by environmental cues. This approach also excluded effects that might be idiosyncratic to individual cues, which in Pristionchus include crowding, starvation, and other metabolic influences. Further, these genes were identified from pooled, whole-organism contrasts that, although they obscure responses specific to tissue or developmental stage, we predicted to capture effects across the body, which are known for this case of resource polyphenism. Starting from a known network of switch genes in the mouth-polyphenic model P. pacificus, we established a proof of principle that a similar switch mechanism could be found and manipulated in other diplogastrid nematodes. We adapted CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of two polyphenism switch-genes, eud-1 and seud-1/sult-1, in the dimorphic species P. fissidentatus (Supplementary Fig. 1). These knockouts completely fixed the nematodes’ feeding phenotypes. Just as in P. pacificus, mutant lines were constitutive for the stenostomatous (St, microbivorous) morph and the eurystomatous (Eu, facultatively predatory) morph, respectively (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. 2). Having confirmed these genes as regulators of the polyphenism across Pristionchus, we sequenced the whole transcriptomes of the mutant lines to identify genes with concordant, morph-biased expression in both P. pacificus and P. fissidentatus. Overlap in morph-biased gene expression in the two species revealed 838 genes (488 St-biased; 350 Eu-biased), defining a core set of polyphenism-biased genes inferred to be ancestral to Pristionchus (Fig. 1C). INDEPENDENT BOUTS OF GENETIC ASSIMILATION SHARE COMMON EVOLUTIONARY TARGETS. We next determined if the evolution of any of these morph-biased genes correlated with independent losses of plasticity. To do so, we first used 41 Pristionchus and outgroup species to identify genes uniquely evolving in two species, P. bucculentus and P. elegans, which have assimilated a single morph (Fig. 1A). Although the sister-group relationship between these two species implies a single assimilation event, P. bucculentus appears to have fixed the Eu form, whereas the divergence of form in P. elegans is so extreme as to confound homology with either the Eu or St morph, consistent with high post-assimilation evolutionary rates in Diplogastridae. Therefore, we analysed both Eu- and St-biased genes without assuming which set was constitutively expressed during assimilation. Comparing previously published, whole transcriptomes from across Pristionchus and outgroups, we identified those genes showing episodic, or branch-specific, diversifying selection in these two species, thereby defining evolutionary targets associated with the loss of plasticity (Supplementary Table 1). We then tested whether any of these genes likewise reported selection associated with an independent assimilation event (Fig. 1A), which would point to a potentially generalizable feature of plasticity’s loss in Diplogastridae. Specifically, we intersected our results with patterns of episodic, diversifying selection in the species Diplogasteroides magnus and Levipalatum texanum, whose mouth morphologies were, like the two Pristionchus species above, the product of increased evolutionary rates following assimilation. As in P. elegans, the assimilated forms of D. magnus and L. texanum have diverged beyond identification as either the Eu or St morph, although an outgroup to these species (Oigolaimella spp.) suggests the Eu morph may have been fixed. For these analyses, we used these two monomorphic species and polyphenic representative",PMC,neg,0,neg,6398,neg_PMC,0.007651032,0
38117206,"Ions Adsorbed at Amorphous Solid/Solution Interfaces Form Wigner Crystal-like Structures. When a surface is immersed in a solution, it usually acquires a charge, which attracts counterions and repels co-ions to form an electrical double layer. The ions directly adsorbed to the surface are referred to as the Stern layer. The structure of the Stern layer normal to the interface was described decades ago, but the lateral organization within the Stern layer has received scant attention. This is because instrumental limitations have prevented visualization of the ion arrangements except for atypical, model, crystalline surfaces. Here, we use high-resolution amplitude modulated atomic force microscopy (AFM) to visualize in situ the lateral structure of Stern layer ions adsorbed to polycrystalline gold, and amorphous silica and gallium nitride (GaN). For all three substrates, when the density of ions in the layer exceeds a system-dependent threshold, correlation effects induce the formation of close packed structures akin to Wigner crystals. Depending on the surface and the ions, the Wigner crystal-like structure can be hexagonally close packed, cubic, or worm-like. The influence of the electrolyte concentration, species, and valence, as well as the surface type and charge, on the Stern layer structures is described. When the system parameters are changed to reduce the Stern layer ion surface excess below the threshold value, Wigner crystal-like structures do not form and the Stern layer is unstructured. For gold surfaces, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that when sufficient potential is applied to the surface, ion clusters form with dimensions similar to the Wigner crystal-like structures in the AFM images. The lateral Stern layer structures presented, and in particular the Wigner crystal-like structures, will influence diverse applications in chemistry, energy storage, environmental science, nanotechnology, biology, and medicine.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6400,neg_MEDLINE,0.002458213,0
38131449,"Flagellar motor protein-targeted search for the druggable site of Helicobacter pylori. The deleterious impact of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) on human health is contingent upon its ability to create and sustain colony structure, which in turn is dictated by the effective performance of flagella - a multi-protein rotary nanodevice. Hence, to design an effective therapeutic strategy against H. pylori, we here conducted a systematic search for an effective druggable site by focusing on the structure-dynamics-energetics-stability landscape of the junction points of three 1 : 1 protein complexes (FliFC-FliGN, FliGM-FliMM, and FliYC-FliNC) that contribute mainly to the rotary motion of the flagella via the transformation of information along the junctions over a wide range of pH values operative in the stomach (from neutral to acidic). We applied a gamut of physiologically relevant perturbations in the form of thermal scanning and mechanical force to sample the entire quasi - and non-equilibrium conformational spaces available for the protein complexes under neutral and acidic pH conditions. Our perturbation-induced magnification of conformational distortion approach identified pH-independent protein sequence-specific evolution of precise thermally labile segments, which dictate the specific thermal unfolding mechanism of each complex and this complex-specific pH-independent structural disruption notion remains consistent under mechanical stress as well. Complementing the above observations with the relative rank-ordering of estimated equilibrium binding free energies between two protein sequences of a specific complex quantifies the extent of structure-stability modulation due to pH alteration, rationalizes the exceptional stability of H. pylori under acidic pH conditions, and identifies the pH-independent complex-sequence-segment-residue diagram for targeted drug design.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6405,neg_MEDLINE,0.007815888,0
38153175,"Control of nuclear envelope dynamics during acute ER stress by LINC complexes disassembly and selective, asymmetric autophagy of the outer nuclear membrane. WHEN CELLS ARE STRESSED, THE ER GETS BIGGER. The size and activity of the ER can rapidly be adapted to the cell’s needs. Physiological or pathological signals or stresses activate UPRs to increase the ER volume and fill the organelle lumen and membranes with biosynthetic enzymes, ion channels and pumps, molecular chaperones. Among physiological cues, the ER expansion upon differentiation of a B cell to a plasma cell that produces in the ER and secretes extracellularly more than 2000 immunoglobulin chains/sec is an amazing example of the magnitude of this phenomenon. WHEN THE STRESS IS OVER, THE ER RESUMES PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE AND ACTIVITY. In some cases, as illustrated for the differentiation of a B cell to a plasma cell, the expansion of the ER is an irreversible process. Antibody-producing plasma cells eventually die after a few days of fight against the invading pathogen. However, there are documented examples of ER expansion followed by lysosomal clearance of the excess ER generated during the UPR phase to resume the physiological size of the compartment. The group of Weibel reported in the late 1960s that treatment of rats with phenobarbital, an anti-epileptic drug, causes swelling of the ER in liver hepatocytes (Figure 1A, B). A few years later, the same group made the seminal observation that upon interruption of the pharmacological treatment, the ER resumes its original size (Figure 1B–D). Weibel and friends observed that during the recovery phase, the ER is fragmented, and ER portions are selectively eaten-up by single membrane, degradative, lysosomal compartments. This is one of the first reports on selective reticulophagy, which had to await for mechanistic dissection several decades. SEC62 AND THE PROCESS OF RECOV-ER-PHAGY. Cyclopiazonic acid proved optimal to induce a UPR that was rapidly shut down upon wash-out of this reversible inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. Our study revealed the involvement of the translocon component SEC62 as the LC3-binding reticulophagy receptor that regulates lysosomal clearance of excess ER during recovery from ER stress (recov-ER-phagy). Upon ER fragmentation, the excess ER portions are directly engulfed by RAB7- and LAMP1-positive endolysosomes under the control of the ESCRT-III machinery (Figures. 1C, black arrow, recov-ER-phagy). Thus, piecemeal microreticulophagy mechanistically defines the resumption of physiological ER size and activity upon ER stress resolution. AND THE NUCLEAR ENVELOPE? The ER membrane (black in Figure 1) continues in the ONM (blue) that merges at the nuclear pore complexes (NPC) with the INM (red). Consequently, the ER lumen is contiguous to the perinuclear space enclosed between ONM and INM (Figure 1). In our latest publication [1], inspection of room temperature and cryo-electron microscopy micrographs reveals that in mammalian cultured cells, the expansion of the ER induced by cyclopiazonic acid is transmitted to the NE. The distance between the ONM and the INM increases from 20–50 nm measured at steady state, to up to 180 nm, with a considerable expansion of the perinuclear space. The physiological NE ultrastructure is restored a few hours after termination of the stress condition. Live cell imaging and electron tomography reveal that during recovery, the ONM vesiculates and ONM portions are engulfed by RAB7- and LAMP1-positive endolysosomes. KEEPING THE DISTANCE, BREAKING THE DISTANCE: THE DYNAMICS OF LINC COMPLEXES. The distance between the INM and the ONM is maintained between 25 and 50 nm by the LINC complexes. These are formed by INM proteins of the SUN family and ONM proteins of the SYNE/NESPRIN family, covalently associated via an intermolecular disulfide bond (Figure 1E). Transmission of the ER-expansion to the NE and the substantial increase of the distance between INM and ONM implies the rupture of the LINC complexes, which we verified by cryogenic Focus Ion Beam milling followed by cryo-electron tomography (FIB-CET) of vitrified cells. REDUCTIVE DISASSEMBLY OF THE LINC COMPLEX BY THE ONM-RESIDENT REDUCTASE TMX4. Dissociation of SUN proteins from SYNE/NESPRIN partners in the LINC complex (Figure 1E, F) requires the intervention of a reductase that nucleophilically attacks the cysteine residue of one disulfide-bonded partner, thus releasing the other. Ectopic expression of trapping forms of redox enzymes carrying a point mutation in the catalytic site that prevents release of clients, immunoisolation of the complexes and identification of the clients by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed endogenous SYNE/NESPRIN proteins as preferential clients of the reductase TMX4, an ill-defined member of the protein disulfide isomerase superfamily that we localized in the ONM by transmission immunoelectron microscopy. ALL IN ALL: RECOV-ER-PHAGY AND ONM-PHAGY. As we previously reported for the removal of excess ER to restore physiological size and activity during recovery from ER stress (Figure 1C, black arrow, recov-ER-phagy, 1D), also the return of the NE at physiological shape (Figure 1C, blue arrow, ONM-phagy, 1D) is driven by the activation of the reticulophagy receptor SEC62 and proceeds via microautophagy, where endolysosomes directly engulf the portions of ONM to be removed from cells (Figures. 1C). Silencing or deletion of TMX4 substantially inhibits the transmission of the ER swelling to the NE upon perturbation of ER homeostasis and the lysosomal clearance of ONM portions during the phase of recovery from acute stresses (Figure 1C, blue arrow). OUTLOOK. Deletion of Tmx4 is toxic to cells, and we observe that cells lacking TMX4 have a rigid, condensed NE, which does not swell upon ER perturbation. In mammalian cells, the perinuclear space must somewhat be expanded (i.e., the distance between the INM and the ONM must increase) for nuclear egress of ribonucleoprotein particles, misfolded protein aggregates and herpes virus capsids that cannot be tr",PMC,neg,0,neg,6412,neg_PMC,0.0025509126,0
38177243,"The juxtamembrane linker of synaptotagmin 1 regulates Ca2+ binding via liquid-liquid phase separation. INTRODUCTION. It is well established that Ca2+ binding to the synaptic vesicle (SV) protein, p65/synaptotagmin (syt) 1 triggers rapid, synchronous synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Given its importance in synaptic transmission, syt1 has been studied in detail. Structurally, it consists of an N-terminal luminal domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a juxtamembrane linker followed by tandem C2-domains (designated C2AB) that are connected by a short, flexible segment (Fig. 1a). The tandem C2-domains are thought to bind ~five Ca2+ ions via the acidic side chains of five conserved aspartate residues in the Ca2+-binding loops in each C2-domain. Ca2+ binding is greatly facilitated by anionic phospholipids, namely phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. In response to Ca2+, the C2-domains of syt1 penetrate membranes to trigger fusion. Syt1 has also been shown to regulate folding transitions in SNARE proteins, but the relevance of these interactions remains more controversial. In addition, syt1 clamps spontaneous release and plays a key role in the docking, priming and endocytosis of SVs. Here, we focus on the poorly characterized juxtamembrane segment of this protein. Since syt1 was cloned ~three decades ago, it has been notoriously difficult to express and purify its entire cytoplasmic domain (residues 80–421) for in vitro studies. As a result, since the early 1990s, most biochemical studies made use of a truncated form of the protein, lacking the N-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain (residues 80–95). The truncated protein (residues 96–421) was far more soluble and had much higher yields than the complete cytoplasmic domain. However, there was an indication that the complete juxtamembrane linker, starting at residue 80, might enhance the binding of Ca2+ to the C2A domain, in a C-terminally truncated construct lacking the C2B domain. These findings suggested that the linker serves more than a tethering function. Furthermore, the juxtamembrane linker has been implicated in the oligomerization of syt1. This is of particular interest, given that early studies using Drosophila revealed intragenic complementation between several distinct mutant syt1 alleles, strongly suggesting that syt1 functions in vivo as an oligomer. More recently, electron microscopy (EM) studies from the Rothman group revealed that syt1 forms ring-like oligomers on lipid monolayers, and these structures were disrupted by Ca2+ . In contrast, other EM studies have shown that syt1 forms heptameric barrels in the presence of Ca2+ . In even greater contrast, electron paramagnetic resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance studies suggested that recombinant syt1 does not multimerize at all. Finally, density gradient experiments indicated that syt1 is a monomer that dimerizes in response to Ca2+ , or is a constitutive dimer or a tetramer. Binding assays demonstrated direct interactions between copies of an amino-terminal fragment of syt1, but in these experiments the order of oligomers was unknown. Owing to different experimental conditions and techniques, it remains somewhat unclear whether and how syt1 oligomerizes. As a result of these uncertainties, we recently developed the means to purify the complete cytoplasmic domain of syt1 (residues 80–421), and addressed its ability to oligomerize under near-native conditions using atomic force microscopy. We observed self-association, on lipid bilayer surfaces, into patches and large irregular ring-like structures, mediated by the lysine-rich motif within the juxtamembrane linker. Importantly, mutations that disrupted these interactions impaired the ability of syt1 to both trigger robust, synchronous release in neurons and to clamp spontaneous release. Despite this progress, it is still unclear precisely how syt1 self-associates, as the oligomers lack any apparent ordered structure when visualized under native, aqueous conditions. Here, we delve more deeply into the properties of the juxtamembrane linker of syt1 and address its role in (a) Ca2+ sensing activity, and (b) self-association/multimerization. To our surprise, the lysine-rich motif in the juxtamembrane linker acts as a negative regulator of Ca2+ binding to the C2-domains of syt1. To explore the mechanism underlying this negative regulation, we made the discovery that the complete cytoplasmic domain of syt1 self-associates via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and these interactions are mediated by the juxtamembrane segment. LLPS occurs when a homogeneous liquid phase partitions into two liquid phases (dilute and concentrated phases). It is usually observed in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that form membrane-less biomolecular condensates. Depending on the IDP sequence, LLPS can occur either by the creation of energetically favorable multivalent protein-protein interactions (hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction, π-π stacking, cation-π, etc.) or by the release of unfavorable, preordered, hydration-shell water molecules. LLPS has been described for numerous cytosolic proteins and a more limited number of integral membrane proteins. In this work, we characterize the LLPS of syt1 in detail and describe a model in which the juxtamembrane region, and LLPS, might serve to fine-tune the function of syt1 in nerve terminals. RESULTS. JUXTAMEMBRANE LINKER OF SYT1 INHIBITS CA2+ BINDING TO THE C2-DOMAINS. As outlined above, our understanding of the biochemical properties of the complete, intact cytoplasmic domain of syt1 is limited due to challenges with the expression, purification, and solubility of this protein fragment. We successfully addressed these issues by using a SUMO tag to increase solubility; this tag was removed for all of the biochemical experiments described below. In the first series of experiments, we addressed the ability of the complete cytoplasmic domain to bind Ca2+.

38215186,"On the surprising effectiveness of a simple matrix exponential derivative approximation, with application to global SARS-CoV-2. SIGNIFICANCE. Recent work uses a simplistic approximation to the matrix exponential derivative to apply gold-standard models from evolutionary biology to a collection of challenging data analyses. Whereas one may expect the naive approach to break down with increasing model dimensionality, empirical results show no such failure. Here, we 1) develop rigorous error bounds that improve—in a certain sense—as model dimension grows and 2) demonstrate the scalability of the naive approach to a higher-dimensional analysis of the global spread of the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Phylogeographic methods (1–4) model large-scale viral transmission between human populations as a function of the shared evolutionary history of the viral population of interest. Data take the form of dates, locations, and genome sequences associated with individual viral samples. Spatiotemporal structure interfaces with network structure given by the phylogeny, or family tree, describing the viruses’ collective history beginning with the most recent common ancestor. While one cannot directly observe this history, one may statistically reconstruct the phylogenetic tree by positing that changes in the viral genome happen randomly at regular intervals, thereby capturing the intuition that viral samples with more differences between their (aligned) sequences should find themselves further apart on the family tree. The continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) (5) represents the gold-standard mathematical model for such evolution of characters (e.g., nucleotides) within a fixed span of evolutionary time. A CTMC defined over a discrete, -element state space consists of a row vector whose individual components describe the probability of inhabiting each of the possible states at time as well as a infinitesimal generator (or rate) matrix with nonnegative off-diagonal elements , , and nonpositive diagonal elements . For any lag , the matrix exponential (6, 7) provides the Markov chain’s transition probability matrix. which has elements that dictate the probability of the process jumping from state to state after time . It is straightforward to verify that is a valid transition matrix, having probability vectors for rows: If and are the column vectors of ones and zeros, respectively, then and, therefore, . The law of total probability then provides the marginal probability of the process at any time as . Whether frequentist (8) or Bayesian (9–12) likelihood-based approaches to phylogenetic reconstruction allow phylogenetic tree branch lengths to parameterize time lags within the CTMC framework. We present the exact statement of the phylogenetic CTMC paradigm below (Section 3). Here, we note that the historical importance of tree-reconstruction from aligned sequences leads to an early emphasis on the sparse specification of based on biologically motivated assumptions (13–15). Classical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedures (16, 17) work well for such low-dimensional models. But the phylogenetic CTMC framework has applications beyond simple nucleotide substitution models. Within, e.g., Bayesian phylogeography, the work in ref. 1 provides a phylogenetic CTMC model for the spread of avian influenza across global geographic locations but, for computational reasons, favors a low-dimensional parameterization of . Similarly, Lemey et al. (2) model the spread of influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 between as many as geographic regions but—again for computational reasons—fit the model with approximation techniques that provide no inferential guarantees. Recently, Magee et al. (18) demonstrate the feasibility of approximate gradient-based methods for both maximum a posteriori and full Bayesian inference of flexible and fully-parameterized rate models and apply these methods to a gold-standard mixed-effect CTMC model for the spread of A H3N2 influenza between geographic locations. The usual CTMC log-likelihood gradient calculations feature the matrix exponential derivative (Eqs. 13 and 15). computed in the direction of each of the natural basis elements spanning the space of real-valued, matrices , thereby requiring at least floating point operations (19). Within the phylogenetic CTMC models of Section 3, log-likelihood derivative computations that require balloon to , for the number of biological specimens observed and the number of parameters parameterizing . To address this overwhelming computational cost, Magee et al. (18) leverage the simplistic approximation obtained by setting within Eq. 3:. Ref. 18 show that this approximation helps reduce total cost to and use this speedup within surrogate-trajectory Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) (SI Appendix) to obtain a 34-fold improvement in effective sample size per second (ESS/s) over random-walk MCMC within their 14-region phylogeographic example. When trying to explain the remarkable empirical performance of the naive approximation, the authors derive an error upper bound (for an arbitrary matrix norm). that fails to leverage the specific forms of and . Notably, this bound explodes as either or diverges to . Of course, the latter quantity would be expected to grow large with dimension without more careful structural assumptions, e.g., that is a rate matrix belonging to the class.

Flexible laser-scribed graphene (LSG) substrates with gold nanoislands have been developed as biochips for in situ electrochemical (EC) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) biodetection (biomolecules and viral proteins). A flexible biochip was fabricated using CO2 laser engraving polyimide (PI) films to form a 3D porous graphene-like nanostructure. Gold nanoislands were deposited on the LSG substrates to enhance the intensity of the Raman signals. Moreover, the addition of auxiliary and reference electrodes induced a dual-function EC-SERS biochip with significantly enhanced detection sensitivity. The biochip could selectively and easily capture SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein through the SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibody immobilized on EC-SERS substrates using 1-ethyl-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). The grafted antibody specifically bound to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a significant increase in the SERS signal of the target analyte. The limit of detection (LOD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein was 5 and 100 ng/mL by using EC and SERS detection, respectively. Although the LOD of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detected using SERS is only 100 ng/mL, it can provide fingerprint information for identification. To improve the LOD, EC detection was integrated with SERS detection.

38279925,"Computational investigation of impact of Pb(II) and Ni(II) ions on hUNG enzyme: insights from molecular dynamics simulations. Human uracil DNA glycosylase (hUNG), a crucial player in the initiation of the base excision repair pathway, is susceptible to alterations in function and conformation induced by the accumulation of toxic metals. Despite the recognized impact of toxic metals on DNA repair enzymes, there exists a notable deficiency in theoretical investigations addressing this phenomenon. This study investigates the impact of toxic heavy metal ions, Pb(II) and Ni(II), on the stability of hUNG through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The initial analysis involved the identification of key cavities in the hUNG enzyme. Notably, the active site cavity emerged as a promising site for ligand binding. Subsequently, AutoDockTools software was employed to dock Pb(II) and Ni(II) onto the identified cavities, followed by extensive MD simulations. The MD analysis, encompassing parameters such as root mean square deviation, radius of gyration, solvent accessible surface area, hydrogen bond variations, Ramachandran plot, principal component analysis, and root mean square fluctuations, collectively revealed distinct alterations in the behavior of the enzyme upon complexation with Pb(II) and Ni(II). Interestingly, the enzyme exhibited enhanced structural stability, reduced flexibility, and modified hydrogen bonding patterns in the presence of these toxic metal ions. The observed limitation in structural flexibility implies a more rigid and stable conformation when the enzyme complex with Pb(II) and Ni(II) compared to its free form. This structural alteration may lead to a potential reduction in enzymatic activity, suggesting that toxic metal ions influence the functional dynamics of hUNG.

However, despite its medical importance, there is a dearth of data on the molecular taxonomy of this mosquito species. Methods: In this study, DNA barcoding analysis was performed on 64 adult female mosquitoes from Trinidad morphologically identified as Hg. janthinomys. The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene and ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of the mosquitoes were PCR amplified and sequenced, and molecular phylogenies inferred. Results: The BLASTN analysis showed that only 20% (n = 13/66) of COI sequences had high similarity (>99% identity) to Hg. janthinomys and the remaining sequences had low similarity (<90% identity) to reference GenBank sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of COI sequences revealed the presence of four strongly supported groups, with one distinct clade that did not align with any reference sequences. Corresponding ITS2 sequences for samples in this distinct COI group clustered into three clades.

38340068,"Competitive Charge Separation Pathways in a Flexible Molecular Folda-Dimer. INTRODUCTION. Molecular chromophore systems are promising candidates for light-activated applications, such as optoelectronics, photocatalysis, sensing, and imaging. These materials exhibit excellent light-harvesting characteristics and synthetic tunability, but they also demonstrate very complicated potential energy surfaces with multiple competitive photoactive pathways. Electronic and vibrational coupling between adjacent chromophores mediates light-driven processes, such as photoinduced charge separation, light-harvesting, excitation energy transfer, and singlet fission. There is a significant need and interest to understand the interplay between molecular conformation and photophysics within such complex excited state energy surfaces. Electronic and vibrational coupling between molecular chromophores occurs through covalent and noncovalent interactions. In particular, π-stacking between adjacent molecules can alter the potential energy surface relative to the monomeric condition. This is critical when considering solid-state applications, such as organic photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes, where π-stacking interactions between a large number of chromophores can result in the formation of dark trap states that hinder device performance. This behavior is even observed in smaller-scale dimer systems, which exhibit π-stacking chromophore association. While photoexcited dynamics in such materials are often described as a sequence of well-defined (diabatic) electronic states, these states are often coherently mixed with varying electronic and spin character. Such coherent mixing indicates that the involved states are similar in both energy and geometry. This also means that the system is rarely in a “pure” Frenkel exciton state, but more likely in a mixture, for example, between a Frenkel and charge transfer state. The ultimate photoexcited dynamics of a given system will depend therefore on how the molecular conformation and solvent environment tunes the potential energy surface and electronic state mixing and directs the evolution of the photoexcited population. Structurally well-defined bi- and trichromophoric systems have often been used as model systems to illustrate the role of structure on the exciton dynamics in molecular assemblies. Many such model systems studied in the past had a rigid molecular framework. The covalent bridge between the chromophoric units in those systems did not offer any structural flexibility, thus fixing the relative orientations and electronic coupling between the chromophores. Conformationally dynamic molecular systems, on the other hand, offer versatile frameworks to develop responsive materials with self-assembling characteristics. A flexible design allows insight into the interplay between the structural dynamics of a molecular assembly and exciton photophysics. We designed a folda-dimeric system PDI-AnEt2-PDI (see Figure 1 for structure) wherein two electron-accepting perylene diimide (PDI) chromophores are covalently bound to an electron-donating N,N-diethylaniline (AnEt2). The AnEt2 also serves as a bridging moiety, imparting conformational flexibility to the system, thus giving the opportunity to investigate donor–acceptor interaction in varying molecular orientations. PDI chromophores offer an attractive model system to study the correlation between intermolecular coupling, conformation, and photophysics. They are chemically robust, exhibit high extinction coefficients in the visible region, and are also good electron acceptors and transporters. The last of these is facilitated by the tendency of PDI chromophores to form π-stacked architectures, for example, as H-type or J-type aggregates. Depending on the solvent environment, PDI-AnEt2-PDI adopts either an open conformation, with the two PDI chromophores far apart from each other, or a folded configuration, with the two PDI chromophores within the π-stacking distance. This allows us to study the dependence of photophysical dynamics on the folda-dimer conformation. We find that the folda-dimer exhibits multiple simultaneous photophysical pathways. In the open form, charge separation with the bridging AnEt2 is observed, which we term Bridge electron transfer (Bridge ET). In the folded form, Bridge ET competes with a second charge separation pathway of symmetry-breaking charge separation (SBCS) between the two π-stacked PDI chromophores. Furthermore, our findings indicate that SBCS outcompetes any excimer formation in the folded form. The conformational flexibility of PDI-AnEt2-PDI further controls the photophysics by allowing for dynamic structural changes. Our results yield insight into how to mediate competitive photophysical pathways and mixed-electronic states in conformationally dynamic molecular chromophore systems. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS. MATERIALS. The PDI monomer for control experiments (N,N-dipentyl-3,4,9,10-perylenedicarboximide, referred to as PDI-ref) and all of the solvents used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.

38345841,"CryoEM structures of the human CLC-2 voltage-gated chloride channel reveal a ball-and-chain gating mechanism. INTRODUCTION. Ion transport across the cell membrane establishes and exploits ion gradients to store energy and regulate electrical signaling. Ion transport is catalyzed by two classes of membrane proteins: ion channels and active transporters. The CLC ‘Chloride Channel’ family encompasses both major ion-transport mechanisms: half of the CLC homologs are electrodiffusive chloride (Cl−) channels, and half are secondary active transporters that stoichiometrically exchange Cl− for protons (H+) (Jentsch and Pusch, 2018). The occurrence of two mechanisms in one family suggests they operate by variations on a common theme (Miller, 2006), and experimental results revealed that CLC channels are ‘broken’ transporters (Lísal and Maduke, 2008). In both CLC channels and transporters, a conserved glutamate residue referred to as the ‘gating glutamate’ (Egate) plays a central mechanistic role. High-resolution CLC transporter structures show that this residue can adopt four different conformations (Dutzler et al., 2002; Dutzler et al., 2003; Feng et al., 2010; Chavan et al., 2020; Schrecker et al., 2020, Figure 1A), which contribute to the Cl−/H+ exchange mechanism (Accardi and Miller, 2004; Feng et al., 2012; Chavan et al., 2020; Leisle et al., 2020). Due to the small number of CLC channel structures relative to transporters, characterization of the central role for the Egate residue in CLC channels has primarily relied on extensive functional studies of channel gating rather than observed Egate side-chain conformations (Jentsch and Pusch, 2018). The first CLC channel structure reported was of bovine CLC-K (Park et al., 2017), a kidney-expressed homolog that is the lone CLC homolog lacking the Egate (Kieferle et al., 1994). The only other CLC channel structures reported prior to 2023 are of the human CLC-1: one of these cryoEM structures shows Egate in the ‘out’ position (Park and MacKinnon, 2018) while the other lacked density for Egate (Wang et al., 2019). The Egate ‘out’ position was originally posited to be exclusive to the CLC channel homologs, as its positioning off to the side widens the Cl− permeation pathway and, in CLC-1, results in a continuous pathway (Park and MacKinnon, 2018). Such a continuous pathway precludes exchange coupling (Jardetzky, 1966; Miller, 2021). The open Cl− permeation pathway in the CLC-1 structure is consistent with the known functional properties of CLC-1 in the absence of an applied transmembrane (TM) voltage. CLC-1 is a voltage-gated channel that is predominantly in the open state at zero mV (Altamura et al., 2020, Figure 1B). At negative TM voltages that favor CLC-1 closing, the Egate side chain presumably moves to either the ‘middle’ or ‘down’ positions, or both, to occlude the channel pore. CLC-2, like CLC-1, is a voltage-gated channel, but with opposite voltage dependence, opening instead of closing in response to hyperpolarization (Thiemann et al., 1992; Wang et al., 2017). CLC-2 chloride channels are expressed in every mammalian organ, where they play diverse physiological functions (Thiemann et al., 1992; Lein et al., 2007; Duan, 2013; Stölting et al., 2014; Jentsch and Pusch, 2018). Perturbation of CLC-2 function is associated with human disease including leukodystrophies (Jentsch and Pusch, 2018), blindness (Xu et al., 2023), primary aldosteronism (Fernandes-Rosa et al., 2018; Scholl et al., 2018), and atrial fibrillation (Hansen et al., 2020). Despite their importance in human physiology, our understanding of CLC-2 molecular and physiological mechanisms is incomplete. A mystery concerning CLC-2 is why electrophysiological recordings of natively expressed channels reveal tremendous variation in voltage-dependent gating. CLC-2 currents are typically inwardly rectifying and activated by hyperpolarization, but the kinetics and degree of rectification are highly variable (Bösl et al., 2001; Jentsch and Pusch, 2018). In some cases, this variability is understood – for example interactions between CLC-2 and the astrocytic GlialCAM protein yields voltage-independent currents (Jeworutzki et al., 2012; Maduke and Reimer, 2012). Yet many questions about CLC-2 gating remain. Like CLC-1, CLC-2 gating depends critically on Egate (Niemeyer et al., 2003; Cederholm et al., 2010). At zero mV, CLC-2 is predominantly in the closed state (Stölting et al., 2013; Stölting et al., 2014; Jentsch and Pusch, 2018), presumably with Egate blocking the pore. Such pore localization for Egate was modeled in a recent CLC-2 cryoEM structure (Ma et al., 2023) however, experimental density for the side chain was lacking, and therefore the precise structure of this gate remains uncertain (Figure 1B). Structures with improved resolution will be crucial to understanding CLC-2 gating, which involves interactions between Egate, Cl− , and H+, with differential effects of external vs internal ions (Pusch et al., 1999; Niemeyer et al., 2003; Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2010; Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2012; De Jesús-Pérez et al., 2016). In addition to the Egate mechanism, a ‘ball-and-chain’ gating mechanism, in which the tethered N-terminus blocks the pore, has been proposed for CLC-2 (Gründer et al., 1992). However, this idea has been controversial (Varela et al., 2002) and the mechanism by which mutations in the N-terminal domain influence gating remains unknown. Because a structural foundation for understanding CLC-2 gating has been lacking, we determined cryoEM structures of CLC-2, in the presence and absence of the selective inhibitor AK-42 (Koster et al., 2020). The structures and complementary electrophysiology data presented here provide atomic insight into an N-terminal hairpin gating mechanism for CLC-2 channels. RESULTS.

38389118,"Melting and Bubble Formation in a Double-Stranded DNA: Microscopic Aspects of Early Base-Pair Opening Events and the Role of Water. Despite its rigid structure, DNA is a remarkably flexible molecule. Flexibility is essential for biological functions (such as transcription and gene repair), which require large-amplitude structural changes such as bubble formation. The bubbles thus formed are required to have a certain stability of their own and survive long on the time scale of molecular motions. A molecular understanding of fluctuations leading to quasi-stable structures is not available. Through extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a sequence of microscopic events that culminate in local bubble formation, which is initiated by base-pair (BP) opening, resulting from the cleavage of native BP hydrogen bonds (HBs). This is followed by the formation of mismatched BPs with non-native contacts. These metastable structures can either revert to their original forms or undergo a flipping transition to form a local bubble that can span across 3-4 BPs. A substantial distortion of the DNA backbone and a disruption of BP stacking are observed because of the structural changes induced by these local perturbations. We also explored how water helps in the entire process. A small number of water molecules undergo rearrangement to stabilize the intermediate states by forming HBs with DNA bases. Water thus acts as a lubricant that counteracts the enthalpic penalty suffered from the loss of native BP contacts. Although the process of bubble formation is reversible, the sequence of steps involved poses an entropic barrier, preventing it from easily retracing the path to the native state.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6518,neg_MEDLINE,0.0020348171,0
38397158,"The Intriguing Mystery of RPA Phosphorylation in DNA Double-Strand Break Repair. 1. INTRODUCTION. Replication protein A (RPA) is a multifaceted, heterotrimeric protein involved in various DNA metabolism activities, including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage signaling, and DNA repair mechanisms [1]. RPA is the main ssDNA-binding protein in humans. Historically, RPA was first discovered in the Kelly laboratory at Johns Hopkins University and identified as one of six purified components needed for in vitro simian virus 40 DNA replication. Then, RPA was found to play essential roles in all DNA metabolism pathways that involve single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) [2]. RPA research was pioneered and studied throughout Dr. Marc Wold’s entire career, who discovered the critical role of RPA in various pathways and the importance of RPA regulation by post-translational modifications (PTMs) [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33]. RPA research has dramatically expanded and is of interest to many scientists. The RPA heterotrimer has three subunits named after their corresponding molecular weights: RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14 [34]. Over the years, research has shown that RPA has multiple types and patterns of PTMs, including acetylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, ADP ribosylation, and phosphorylation [28,35,36,37,38]. In this review, we focus on the role of phosphorylation. Many studies dating back to 1990 have focused on the phosphorylation of RPA, specifically the N-terminal domain of RPA32, because of the impact phosphorylation has on cell cycle regulation [39]. Also, the phosphorylation of RPA32 is easy to detect due to a noticeable shift to a higher molecular weight of the RPA32 subunit on SDS-PAGE. RPA32 has a long, unstructured N-terminal tail that is phosphorylated, and these sites have several phosphospecific antibodies. The phosphorylation of other subunits has also been studied through western blot and isoelectric focusing analysis of phosphoisoforms [40,41]. However, reagents for these sites could be more developed. Since RPA phosphorylation before and after DNA damage has been shown, it is important to determine which sites on RPA are most important for the function of RPA to repair DNA damage, such as double-stranded breaks (DSBs) [40]. Previous data revealed that phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase-like serine/threonine protein kinase (PIKK) sites and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) sites are critical for DNA repair [42,43,44]. Some examples of PIKK sites that will be of interest throughout this review are AT-mutated (ataxia telangiectasia, ATM) and AT and Rad3-related (ATR). Interestingly, RPA contains numerous PIKK sites, which may affect RPA function. Over the decades, numerous reviews have been conducted about RPA’s structure and function [16,23,29,35,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62]. This review will discuss novel research and more recent findings on RPA. Specifically, we will cover recent discoveries in the structure/function of RPA in DNA metabolism, interactions, and PTMs involving RPA, specific details on RPA phosphorylation in the DNA damage response (DDR) in the homologous recombination pathway, and finally conclude with a summary of necessary areas for future RPA research. 2. STRUCTURE OF RPA. Heterotrimeric RPA has seven structured domains. RPA70 contains domains A, B, C, and F, with disordered linkers connecting the ordered domains and a zinc atom in domain C (Figure 1A). RPA32 has structured domains D and wHLH (winged helix-loop-helix), which are also connected by disordered linkers. Finally, RPA14 is entirely composed of one ordered domain named E. In Figure 1, each domain is drawn as a colored box, which indicates a known structure, whereas the black and white rectangles are disordered regions connecting the ordered, structured domains. Domains A, B, C, and D are where ssDNA binding occurs, and domains F, A, and wHLH contain sequences for protein interactions. The heterotrimeric core of RPA is formed by domains C, D, and E—one domain from each subunit. This unique RPA structure divides six oligosaccharide binding folds (OB-folds) among the heterotrimeric protein subunits. OB-folds are typically five-stranded closed β barrels that interact with ligands such as oligosaccharides, proteins, catalytic substrates, and more. These six OB-folds in RPA are also frequently found in ssDNA-binding proteins (Figure 1B) [53]. RPA70 contains four OB-folds that comprise the DNA binding domains within domains A, B, C, and F. RPA14 domain E and RPA32 domain D are also OB-folds [63,64,65]. The OB-folds are conserved in structure, which have more structural homology than sequence homology (Figure 1C) [53]. Human RPA has been biochemically studied for over 30 years, with structure determination by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [66,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82]. Unfortunately, full-length RPA has not been crystallized as a heterotrimeric protein because of the many disordered regions throughout the protein complex. By dividing RPA into purified domains, it was possible to crystallize each domain individually or with specific binding partners, such as the heterotrimeric core involving domains C, D, and E [71,75,83]. A Ustilago maydis structure was solved composed of ssDNA and domains A, B, C, D, and E [67]. The wHLH domain is also very loosely packed, so NMR was used to determine the wHLH structure with a bound peptide [69,82]. In 2014, Feldkamp and coworkers obtained a crystal structure of the wHLH domain without a peptide [82]. In 2015, Brosey and colleagues studied structural dynamics by NMR to evaluate RPA70-A/B domain binding to ssDNA. They obtained NMR structures for ssDNA bound to RPA70-A/B and compared their results to other structural analyses [84]. Since the flexible disorder is a significant factor in RPA structure, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is another method used. This method allows for low-resolution structures from proteins in solution.",PMC,neg,0,neg,6519,neg_PMC,0.014117894,0

IRE1α is an evolutionary conserved arm of UPR and acts as an interaction platform for many potential proteins that become activated under ER stress conditions. We investigated potential partners of IRE1 α through MS studies and found EXOSC3 as one of the binding partner of IRE1α.

This property of exosomal proteins coincides with IRE1α ribonuclease activities and its mechanism of action is similar to that of IRE1α-RIDD pathway which degrades any unstable mRNA that disrupts cellular homeostasis. At the same time, studies have shown that knockdown of EXOSC3 causes ER stress in human cells, so we speculated that there might be a functional crosstalk between IRE1α and EXOSC3 under ER stress conditions. Therefore, we employed computational tools to predict and explore the stability and dynamics of the IRE1α-EXOSC3 complex. The analysis indicates that IRE1α and EXOSC3 exhibit potential interaction with the involvement of ScanNet, predicting binding pockets between the two proteins. Further, the interaction was validated via co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays, thus suggesting EXOSC3 as a component of the UPRosome complex. Hence, this functional crosstalk might influence the dynamic functional output of IRE1α.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6521,neg_MEDLINE,0.013480104,0
38449709,"Heat shock protein paradigms in cancer progression: future therapeutic perspectives. Heat-shock proteins (HSPs), also known as stress proteins, are ubiquitously present in all forms of life. They play pivotal roles in protein folding and unfolding, the formation of multiprotein complexes, the transportation and sorting of proteins into their designated subcellular compartments, the regulation of the cell cycle, and signalling processes. These HSPs encompass HSP27, HSP40, HSP70, HSP60, and HSP90, each contributing to various cellular functions. In the context of cancer, HSPs exert influence by either inhibiting or activating diverse signalling pathways, thereby impacting growth, differentiation, and cell division. This article offers an extensive exploration of the functions of HSPs within the realms of pharmacology and cancer biology. HSPs are believed to play substantial roles in the mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of cancer. They hold promise as valuable clinical markers for cancer diagnosis, potential targets for therapeutic interventions, and indicators of disease progression. In times of cellular stress, HSPs function as molecular chaperones, safeguarding the structural and functional integrity of proteins and aiding in their proper folding. Moreover, HSPs play a crucial role in cancer growth, by regulating processes such as angiogenesis, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6534,neg_MEDLINE,0.0020507437,0
38454525,"Distribution of blood lead and cadmium levels in healthy children aged 0 to 18 years and analysis of related influencing factors in Henan, China: data findings from 2017 to 2022. INTRODUCTION. With the development of modern industry and transportation, heavy metal pollutants are gradually exposed and released, and heavy metal pollution in the environment is becoming increasingly serious, and the resulting harm to human health has caused widespread concern. Heavy metals in the environment can enter the human body through a variety of pathways, and children in particular are a susceptible population to environmental pollution [1]. Many studies have revealed that children are more sensitive to heavy metal toxicity because they are in the early stages of rapid growth and development, and their blood-brain barrier and immune system are not yet sufficiently developed [2–4]. Thus, long-term heavy metal exposure will have adverse effects on children's intelligence and growth and development, which will easily lead to multiple damages in children [2–4]. Heavy metals lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) are toxic and harmful substances widely present in production and living environment, causing environmental pollution and also seriously threatening human health. Lead and cadmium are the two heavy metals that pose the greatest threat to children's health in the environment [4]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified lead and cadmium as human carcinogens (Group I), and childhood Pb poisoning and Cd poisoning have become a global public health problem that has caused widespread concern worldwide [4–6]. The effects of Pb exposure on children's health are multifaceted and include intellectual impairment [7], cognitive deficits [8], adverse behavioral outcomes [9], low birth weight/height [10], and negative consequences on bone composition and development [3], which can be observed even at low levels of exposure [11]. In 2012, the United State (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention concluded that there was no safe level of Pb exposure and revised the reference value from 100µg/L to 50µg/L. This reference value was based on 97.5% of blood lead concentrations in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) population and served as a trigger point to guide clinical and public health interventions [12]. Afterwards, 35µg/L was recommended to the CDC as a cut-off value based on NHANES survey data from 2011-2014, and this concentration is still under review [13]. Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal that has no physiological role in the human body and can cause damage to many systems such as bone, nerve, immune, respiratory, circulatory, urinary and reproductive. Studies have indicated that Cd intake can increase the risk of cancer and death and lead to kidney damage and decrease bone mineral density, which can lead to diseases such as osteochondrosis and osteoporosis [14]. Low blood cadmium levels (BCLs) may be associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes or neurobehavioral manifestations [15]. There is also no available reference safe level of Cd exposure in children. In China, with the phasing out of leaded gasoline in 2000, blood lead levels (BLLs) in children dropped dramatically, such a conclusion was made by reviewing blood Pb (PbB) studies conducted across China [16]. However, some relevant sources of Pb exposures in children still persist, such as exposure through food, drinking water, tobacco smoke and contaminated dust particles [17]. Cadmium is readily absorbed by various plants, such as vegetables, grains and tobacco. Tobacco smoke is volatile and can be effectively absorbed after inhalation and is a major source of exposure [17]. From a public health perspective, there is an urgent need for adequate information on adverse events related to Pb and Cd exposure. Blood samples are still one of the most commonly accepted options for laboratory analysis to assess recent and past exposure to chemical contaminants. Whole blood has been the preferred biofluid for assessing Pb exposure, both for screening and diagnosis and for long-term biomonitoring. BLL remains the most reliable indicator of recent Pb exposure [9]. Cd enters the body and binds mainly to blood cells, and BCL can represent recent Cd exposure [18]. Most of the available studies on BLLs and BCLs in children have focused on areas with Pb and Cd contamination [19, 20]. Alternatively, studies have been conducted on non-healthy children (usually a group of children with certain diseases) [21], or have monitored the results of the survey only for a certain age group [16–18]. There is still a lack of data on BLLs and BCLs in healthy children of all ages from 0 to 18 years in China. This study was performed to analyze the BLLs and BCLs in healthy children aged 0-18 years from 2017 to 2022 in urban and rural areas of Henan Province, Central China, as well as their relationships with socio-demographic variables and certain relevant exposure factors.

38456823,"Flexibility of Binding Site is Essential to the Ca2+ Selectivity in EF-Hand Calcium-Binding Proteins. High binding affinity and selectivity of metal ions are essential to the function of metalloproteins. Thus, understanding the factors that determine these binding characteristics is of major interest for both fundamental mechanistic investigations and guiding of the design of novel metalloproteins. In this work, we perform QM cluster model calculations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) free energy simulations to understand the binding selectivity of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the wild-type carp parvalbumin and its mutant. While a nonpolarizable MM model (CHARMM36) does not lead to the correct experimental trend, treatment of the metal binding site with the DFTB3 model in a QM/MM framework leads to relative binding free energies (ΔΔGbind) comparable with experimental data. For the wild-type (WT) protein, the calculated ΔΔGbind is ∼6.6 kcal/mol in comparison with the experimental value of 5.6 kcal/mol. The good agreement highlights the value of a QM description of the metal binding site and supports the role of electronic polarization and charge transfer to metal binding selectivity. For the D51A/E101D/F102W mutant, different binding site models lead to considerable variations in computed binding affinities. With a coordination number of seven for Ca2+, which is shown by QM/MM metadynamics simulations to be the dominant coordination number for the mutant, the calculated relative binding affinity is ∼4.8 kcal/mol, in fair agreement with the experimental value of 1.6 kcal/mol. The WT protein is observed to feature a flexible binding site that accommodates a range of coordination numbers for Ca2+, which is essential to the high binding selectivity for Ca2+ over Mg2+. In the mutant, the E101D mutation reduces the flexibility of the binding site and limits the dominant coordination number of Ca2+ to be seven, thereby leading to reduced binding selectivity against Mg2+. Our results highlight that the binding selectivity of metal ions depends on both the structural and dynamical properties of the protein binding site.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6537,neg_MEDLINE,0.0036006027,0
38458604,"Anthrax Toxin: Model System for Studying Protein Translocation. Dedicated translocase channels are nanomachines that often, but not always, unfold and translocate proteins through narrow pores across the membrane. Generally, these molecular machines utilize external sources of free energy to drive these reactions, since folded proteins are thermodynamically stable, and once unfolded they contain immense diffusive configurational entropy. To catalyze unfolding and translocate the unfolded state at appreciable timescales, translocase channels often utilize analogous peptide-clamp active sites. Here we describe how anthrax toxin has been used as a biophysical model system to study protein translocation. The tripartite bacterial toxin is composed of an oligomeric translocase channel, protective antigen (PA), and two enzymes, edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF), which are translocated by PA into mammalian host cells. Unfolding and translocation are powered by the endosomal proton gradient and are catalyzed by three peptide-clamp sites in the PA channel: the α clamp, the ϕ clamp, and the charge clamp. These clamp sites interact nonspecifically with the chemically complex translocating chain, serve to minimize unfolded state configurational entropy, and work cooperatively to promote translocation. Two models of proton gradient driven translocation have been proposed: (i) an extended-chain Brownian ratchet mechanism and (ii) a proton-driven helix-compression mechanism. These models are not mutually exclusive; instead the extended-chain Brownian ratchet likely operates on β-sheet sequences and the helix-compression mechanism likely operates on α-helical sequences. Finally, we compare and contrast anthrax toxin with other related and unrelated translocase channels.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6539,neg_MEDLINE,0.04438999,0

As single-domain proteins are the basic building block of multiple-domain proteins or protein complexes composed of subunits, the free energy landscapes of single-domain proteins are of critical importance to understand the folding and unfolding processes of proteins. To explore the free energy landscapes of proteins over large conformational space, the stability of native structure is perturbed by biochemical or mechanical means, and the conformational transition process is measured. In single molecular manipulation experiments, stretching force is applied to proteins, and the folding and unfolding transitions are recorded by the extension time course. Due to the broad force range and long-time stability of magnetic tweezers, the free energy landscape over large conformational space can be obtained. In this article, we describe the magnetic tweezers instrument design, protein construct design and preparation, fluid chamber preparation, common-used measuring protocols including force-ramp and force-jump measurements, and data analysis methods to construct the free energy landscape.

38509636,"Back Interface and Absorber Bulk Deep-Level Trap Optimization Enables Highly Efficient Flexible Antimony Triselenide Solar Cell. 1. INTRODUCTION. Recent decades have witnessed remarkable progress in photovoltaic (PV) technology, addressing humanity's energy demands while mitigating environmental impact.[ ] Among various solar cell types, thin‐film solar cells are particularly notable, offering minimal material usage, light weight, flexibility, and scalability.[ , , ] These features render them ideal for diverse applications, including portable devices, Internet of Things (IoT) integration, and building‐integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems.[ , ] With technological and industrial advancements, there's an increasing need for flexible micro‐electronic energy solutions. This urgency underscores the importance of ongoing research into sustainable, efficient, and stable thin‐film solar cells. Identifying and utilizing eco‐friendly, cost‐effective, inherently stable materials with superior photoelectric properties for high‐efficiency flexible thin‐film solar cells is therefore a priority. Antimony Triselenide (Sb2Se3) has emerged as a viable thin‐film photovoltaic (TFPV) material, owing to its earth‐abundance, low toxicity, and exceptional stability.[ , , ] It exhibits superior optoelectronic characteristics, including an ideal bandgap range of 1.1–1.3 eV, a high absorption coefficient (≈105 cm−1 at short wavelengths), satisfactory carrier mobility (≈10 cm2 V−1 s−1), and a long carrier lifetime (≈60 ns).[ , ] Its unique 1D crystal structure, formed by (Sb4Se6)n ribbons connected through robust Sb─Se covalent bonds and weaker van der Waals forces, confers notable resistance to deformation and electrically favorable grain boundaries. This makes it particularly suitable for flexible device applications.[ , , ] Theoretical models suggest Sb2Se3’s fracture strain could reach 28%, comparable to some ductile organic polymers.[ , ] While rigid Sb2Se3 devices have achieved efficiencies over 10.5%,[ ] research on their flexible counterparts is less advanced, with the highest efficiency recorded at 8.43%.[ ] This indicates a significant performance gap and highlights the need for more research to enhance the efficiency of flexible Sb2Se3 devices. The progression of flexible Sb2Se3 solar devices is closely linked to advancements in flexible substrates and device architectures.[ , ] Presently, planar flexible Sb2Se3 devices are predominantly classified into superstrate and substrate configurations.[ , ] In superstrate configurations, such as those using polyimide (PI) substrates, light penetration through the substrate is essential for cell activation. However, the PI substrate's limited short‐wavelength transmittance can result in significant current loss, thereby reducing the device's power conversion efficiency (PCE) in comparison to glass‐based substrates.[ ] In contrast, substrate‐configured flexible solar cells are less dependent on the optical properties of the substrate, provided it remains stable throughout the fabrication process.[ ] Nonetheless, research on substrate‐configured Sb2Se3 thin‐film solar cells, particularly on flexible substrates, is scarce. In 2018, Wang et al. reported the first instance of such cells on molybdenum (Mo) foil, achieving 5.9% efficiency.[ ] A notable deficiency in open‐circuit voltage (V OC) and fill factor (FF) contributes significantly to the efficiency shortfall in flexible Sb2Se3 devices. Research indicates that the quality of the back‐contact interface is critical for the growth of the Sb2Se3 absorber layer and the back‐contact barrier, both imperative for effective carrier transport and extraction.[ , , , ] To enhance this interface, several groups have explored using PbS colloidal quantum dots, NiOx, or CuSCN films as hole transport layers in rigid configurations, thereby improving carrier transport and minimizing contact barriers.[ , , ] Additionally, Mai's group has employed MoSe2 or PbSe layers to refine the Mo/Sb2Se3 interface, boosting carrier collection efficiency.[ , ] Liang's group, achieving a PCE of 9.24% in rigid substrate‐structured Sb2Se3 solar cells, employed effective interface engineering.[ ] They also introduced a NaF intermediate layer for back contact optimization and defect mitigation, successfully fabricating flexible Sb2Se3 thin‐film solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 8%.[ ] Therefore, interface engineering emerges as a vital strategy for enhancing Sb2Se3 device performance, necessitating further improvements, especially in the back contact interface of flexible devices. Recently, MoO3 thin film, as a wide‐bandgap material with high work function, has been widely used as an interfacial layer in CIGS, CZTSSe, and CdTe solar cells to improve the transmission channel for holes and lessen the carrier recombination at back contact region.[ , ] In this study, we introduce a methodology to enhance the efficiency of flexible Sb2Se3 solar cells via back‐contact interface engineering in a substrate configuration. A MoO3 interlayer is deposited onto flexible Mo‐foil by magnetron sputtering before preparing the Sb precursor layer. Our findings reveal that the MoO3 interlayer not only enhances the crystalline quality and fosters a beneficial [hk1] growth orientation in Sb2Se3 but also effectively reduces the back contact barrier height. This facilitates efficient transport and collection of photogenerated carriers at the buried interface while simultaneously reducing deep defect density and suppressing carrier recombination. Consequently, the flexible Sb2Se3 solar cell achieves an impressive PCE of 8.23%, marked by a substantial increase in V OC (0.479 V) and FF (64.93%). Moreover, the device exhibits remarkable stability and flexibility, withstanding large bending radii and multiple bending cycles. Our study thus presents a robust approach to fabricating highly efficient and flexible Sb2Se3 photovoltaics. 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION.

The RESV/LUT quenched SPI chromophore residues with static mechanism and the endothermic reaction. The SPI- RESV/LUT complexes were formed through hydrogen bond, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Molecular docking confirmed van-der-Waals force as one of the important forces. The interaction of RESV/LUT led to SPI's secondary structure alterations with a decrease in α-helix and random coil and an increase in β-sheet and β-turns.

38526948,"Phosphorylation, disorder, and phase separation govern the behavior of Frequency in the fungal circadian clock. INTRODUCTION. Eukaryotic circadian rhythms of biological phenomena arise from periodic gene expression patterns that oscillate independent of external cues but can be entrained to light and temperature (Hurley et al., 2016). At the molecular level, circadian clocks function as transcription-translation negative feedback loops (TTFLs) that consist of core positive and negative elements (Figure 1A; Crane and Young, 2014). In the long-standing model clock of Neurospora crassa, the transcriptional repressor complex is known as the FFC, named for its three principal components: Frequency (FRQ, Figure 1B), the FRQ-interacting RNA helicase (FRH), and Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) (Cha et al., 2015; Hurley et al., 2016). FRQ is functionally analogous to Period (PER) in insects and mammals, whereas CK1 is an ortholog of the mammalian CK1 and the Drosophila kinase Doubletime (DBT) (Dunlap and Loros, 2017). FRH is found only in the core repressor of the fungal clock. Although FRH is homologous to the yeast helicase MTR4, FRH helicase activity does not appear essential to clock function (Conrad et al., 2016; Hurley et al., 2013). The FFC represses the positive arm of the cycle, which involves two zinc-finger transcription factors, white-collar 1 (WC-1) and white-collar 2 (WC-2) assembled into the white-collar complex (WCC). WCC binding to the clock-box (c-box) activates frq expression (Figure 1A; Froehlich et al., 2002). FRQ production is also highly regulated at the post-transcriptional level through the use of rare codons to retard translation, the expression of an antisense transcript and alternative splicing mechanisms (Cha et al., 2015; Dunlap and Loros, 2017; Zhou et al., 2013). The latter leads to the production of either a long (L-FRQ) or short (S-FRQ) isoform, and the ratio of these isoforms fine-tunes period length in response to ambient temperatures (Diernfellner et al., 2007; Liu et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 2013). Translated FRQ binds to FRH via its FFD domain and to CK1 via its two FCD domains (1 and 2) to form the repressive FFC (Cha et al., 2015; Dunlap and Loros, 2017; Jankowski et al., 2022; Figure 1C), although short linear motifs within FRQ may also broadly influence the FRQ-interactome (Pelham et al., 2021). The FFC enters the nucleus where it directly inhibits the WCC and thereby downregulates frq expression (Hurley et al., 2013). FRQ-mediated WCC phosphorylation by CK1 (and associated kinases) reduces interactions between the WCC and the c-box to close the feedback loop and restart the cycle (Figure 1A; Wang et al., 2019). FRH facilitates interactions between the FFC and the WCC (Conrad et al., 2016), and thus, repressor function likely depends upon the FRQ-mediated association of CK1 and FRH. Whereas interaction regions on the FRQ protein sequence have been identified (Figure 1C), there is little information on the spatial arrangement of the FFC components. Despite low-sequence conservation among the core negative arm proteins across species, they all share a high degree of disorder (Pelham et al., 2020). FRQ, the analogous Drosophila (d) Period (PER) protein, and the analogous mammalian (m) PER have >65% disorder predicted in their sequences with ~86% of the FRQ sequence assumed to have no defined structure (Pelham et al., 2020). Both FRQ and mPER2 have biochemical properties characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) (Hurley et al., 2013; Marzoll et al., 2022). These clock repressors also undergo extensive post-translational modification (PTM), particularly phosphorylation (Dunlap and Loros, 2018; Pelham et al., 2020). FRQ acquires over 100 phosphorylation sites over the course of the circadian day (similar to PER phosphorylation by DBT), predominantly due to CK1 (Baker et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2009). The phosphorylation events have two consequences: (1) those that weaken the interaction between FRQ and the WCC or CK1 (Cha et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2019) and (2) those that direct FRQ down the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Larrondo et al., 2015), although only the former are required for circadian rhythmicity (Larrondo et al., 2015). Multisite phosphorylation of FRQ influences its inhibitory function and clock period length (Larrondo et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2019). Although the consequences of phosphorylation-driven conformational changes in FRQ have been probed by proteolytic sensitivity, the challenges of producing FRQ have limited direct assessment of its conformational properties (Liu et al., 2019; Pelham et al., 2020; Querfurth et al., 2011). IDPs such as FRQ are known to participate in liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), which has emerged as a key mechanism for organizing cellular components, coordinating metabolism and directing signaling through, for example, the formation of membraneless organelles (MLOs) (Dignon et al., 2020; Wright and Dyson, 2015). Emerging studies in plants (Jung et al., 2020), flies (Xiao et al., 2021), and cyanobacteria (Cohen et al., 2014; Pattanayak et al., 2020) implicate LLPS in circadian clocks, and in Neurospora it has recently been shown that the Period-2 (PRD-2) RNA-binding protein influences frq mRNA localization through a mechanism potentially mediated by LLPS (Bartholomai, 2022a). Intriguing questions surround why clock repressor proteins are so disordered, undergo extensive PTM, and whether LLPS has a role to play in their function. Clock proteins and their complexes have been challenging to characterize due to their large size (>100 kDa), low-sequence complexity, extensive disorder, and modification states. Herein, we reconstitute FRQ and the FFC to assess the global and site-specific structural properties of these moieties, as well as the dependence of their properties on multisite phosphorylation. FRQ undergoes non-uniform conformational change upon phosphorylation and arranges FRH close to CK1 in the FFC. We also demonstrate that FRQ indeed participates in phosphorylation-dependent LLPS in vitro, and as a condensate",PMC,pos,1,pos,6571,pos_PMC,0.7692103,1
38563384,"Comparison of the Backbone Dynamics of Dehaloperoxidase-Hemoglobin Isoenzymes. Dehaloperoxidase (DHP) is a multifunctional hemeprotein with a functional switch generally regulated by the chemical class of the substrate. Its two isoforms, DHP-A and DHP-B, differ by only five amino acids and have an almost identical protein fold. However, the catalytic efficiency of DHP-B for oxidation by a peroxidase mechanism ranges from 2- to 6-fold greater than that of DHP-A depending on the conditions. X-ray crystallography has shown that many substrates and ligands have nearly identical binding in the two isoenzymes, suggesting that the difference in catalytic efficiency could be due to differences in the conformational dynamics. We compared the backbone dynamics of the DHP isoenzymes at pH 7 through heteronuclear relaxation dynamics at 11.75, 16.45, and 19.97 T in combination with four 300 ns MD simulations. While the overall dynamics of the isoenzymes are similar, there are specific local differences in functional regions of each protein. In DHP-A, Phe35 undergoes a slow chemical exchange between two conformational states likely coupled to a swinging motion of Tyr34. Moreover, Asn37 undergoes fast chemical exchange in DHP-A. Given that Phe35 and Asn37 are adjacent to Tyr34 and Tyr38, it is possible that their dynamics modulate the formation and migration of the active tyrosyl radicals in DHP-A at pH 7. Another significant difference is that both distal and proximal histidines have a 15-18% smaller S2 value in DHP-B, thus their greater flexibility could account for the higher catalytic activity. The distal histidine grants substrate access to the distal pocket. The greater flexibility of the proximal histidine could also accelerate H2O2 activation at the heme Fe by increased coupling of an amino acid charge relay to stabilize the ferryl Fe(IV) oxidation state in a Poulos-Kraut ""push-pull""-type peroxidase mechanism.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6586,neg_MEDLINE,0.47479856,0

38595940,"Moral considerability of brain organoids from the perspective of computational architecture. INTRODUCTION. Brain organoids recapitulate many aspects of human neural development [1], and may provide insights into disease pathology [2]. Towards this goal, researchers are generating in vitro brain organoids with cell-type diversity [3, 4], areal identity [5–7], vasculature [8], and cytoarchitecture [9–11] that more closely resemble their in vivo counterparts, living human brains. These technological advances raise ethical questions about consent of donors [12], biobanking [13], medical and non-medical (e.g. computing) uses [14], commercialization and commodification [15], multi-stakeholder engagement [16], and governance [17, 18]. However, these concerns do not necessarily involve organoids themselves, as potentially sentient or conscious entities with interests that could merit moral consideration [19]. Here, I will focus primarily on the epistemological question of how to determine whether brain organoids have characteristics that ‘exert a moral obligation on us in virtue of the possession of such intrinsic interests’ [21]. Henry Shevelin developed the concept of psychological moral patiency as a form of moral status that arises when entities, especially novel and unfamiliar ones (e.g. robots, AI, brain organoids), acquire the kind of cognitive equivalence that contributes to the moral status of more familiar entities (e.g. humans, Great Apes, ect) [21]. Recent scientific discoveries hint at the potential for complex neural activities in brain organoids that are associated with human brains, which has motivated questions of whether brain organoids possess capacities worthy of moral consideration. Yet organoid neural development is severely limited compared to other, even minimally, sentient beings. Some argue that current regulations governing stem cell research are adequate for non-conscious, partially developed, brain organoids [22, 23]. However, recent studies have shown that ‘first generation’ human brain organoids (HBOs), defined as those without significant sensory-cognitive-motor-like feedback systems, are capable of generating spontaneous neural network activities with a likeness to features of human brain function [24, 25]. These data offer preliminary evidence that HBOs, in principle, have the intrinsic neurobiological constituency to support acquisition of more complex cognitive processes. The degree to which HBOs acquire more advanced cognitive-like capacities will help advance neuroscience research, but also inform whether additional ethical oversight is warranted [26]. What capacities might ‘next generation’ HBOs, with significant sensory-cognitive-motor-like feedback, be capable of? Several pioneering efforts from federal governments (e.g. National Science Foundation, BEGIN Organoid Intelligence program), universities (e.g. The Mind in Vitro and Organoid Intelligence consortia [27]), and industry (e.g. Cortical Labs) are underway to design neural systems that exhibit synthetic biological intelligence [28]. What kind of framework might we utilize to situate synthetic biological intelligence within our understanding of cognition? Moreover, the approach taken should also inform our ethical stance toward those entities. Similarity-based approaches offer one path by determining whether brain organoids possess neural features that are associated with moral status-conferring cognitive capacities found in humans, namely sentience and consciousness [29, 31]. Challenges arising from this approach have been discussed [32]. Briefly, they claim that the organization of HBOs are likely to diverge in meaningful ways from standard human neuroanatomy based on methods for inducing differentiation, which subsequently limit the utility of ethical claims based on similarity indicators derived from neural activities embedded within fully developed, neurotypical brains. A viable alternative ought to reflect the range of organoids that can be generated and provide a pathway for inferring cognitive capacities in non-conventional biological entities [33]. Attempts to explain major transitions in cognitive evolution could provide a useful starting point for developing an alternative framework that reflects the apparent plasticity of how neurological systems can be organized. To begin, an evolutionary perspective recognizes the expansive diversity of neural systems in nature that implement cognition and the processes by which these systems acquire novel capabilities [34]. Next, emerging theories in computational neuroscience provide a principled approach for investigating how measurable characteristics, like information flows, contribute to cognitive processes. Taken together, an evolutionary and computational perspective could help situate next generation HBOs within a broader theory of how cognition emerges, and evolves, from the organizing principles of neural systems. Specifically, Barron and colleagues offer a theory to explain major transitions in cognitive evolution that, as I will argue, could be used as a heuristic for determining the epistemological criteria for moral consideration of brain organoids [35]. They speculate that foundational changes in how neural systems control the flow of information were necessary for new cognitive-phenotypic spaces to open up for selection to act on and propagate new cognitive capacities along evolutionary lineages. In their view, the overall computational architecture–defined by the way information flows through the system [36]–is central to making predictions about downstream cognitive potential of an entity or lineage of entities. Here, I introduce an architectural approach derived from Barron et al.’s theory that could provide a useful framework for thinking about the epistemological criteria for psychological moral patiency of next generation brain organoids which could acquire the cognitive equivalence of beings with more widely recognized moral status. First, I briefly describe some of the recent research on cognitive-like neural processes t",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,6596,far_neg_PMC,0.0022694687,0
38612876,"An Ensemble Docking Approach for Analyzing and Designing Aptamer Heterodimers Targeting VEGF165. 1. INTRODUCTION. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of proteins plays key roles in regulating physiological vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, namely the process of new blood vessel formations [1,2,3]. At the same time, the VEGF family is also responsible for pathological angiogenesis in diseases such as tumor growth and neovascular age-related macular degeneration [2,3,4,5,6,7]. Therefore, VEGF’s family members are important targets for diagnosing these diseases [2,3]. The human VEGF family comprises five members [7], among which the most studied one is VEGF-A, which is often referred to simply as VEGF. It has several isoforms with different numbers of amino acid residues [7], but VEGF165 with 165 residues is the most abundant and is known to play an important role in pathological angiogenesis [7]. It is a homodimeric protein, with each monomer having a heparin-binding domain (HBD) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD) connected by a flexible linker (Figure 1A) [7,8]. The experimental structures of HBD and RBD are known [9,10], but due to the high flexibility of the linker region, the full structure of the homodimeric VEGF165 is experimentally unknown [8]. Functionally, VEGF binds with VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) and induces dimerization and activation of VEGFR. This triggers signal transduction pathways that are crucial for angiogenesis (Figure 1B) [11,12]. While there are a series of VEGFR variants, VEGFR-2 is known to play a main role in both physiological and pathological angiogenesis [13]. Up to now, significant research efforts have been directed toward discovering inhibitors targeting VEGF to prevent its binding to VEGFR [14]. Several VEGF inhibitors have currently been approved for anti-angiogenic treatment, such as Bevacizumab [15], Aflibercept [16], and Macugen [17]. Aptamers are short single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules used for the molecular recognition of targets with high affinity and specificity [18,19]. Not surprisingly, aptamers have also been used to inhibit the activity of VEGF. Indeed, Macugen is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved RNA aptamer used for treating age-related macular degeneration [17]. Several DNA aptamers, including VEa5, 2G19, and Vap7, have been further developed as anti-angiogenic agents against VEGF [20,21,22,23]. In addition, efforts have been made to enhance the binding affinity of aptamers to VEGF by designing G-quadruplex-forming aptamers [23,24,25] and aptamer dimers [20,23,26,27,28,29]. Naturally, it is important to find an aptamer with high binding affinity to VEGF. Experimentally, it has been shown that homodimers made for monomeric aptamers VEa5, del5-1, and 3R02 show higher affinities with VEGF165 than their respective monomers [26,29]. Another experimental study demonstrated the efficacy of an aptamer heterodimer composed of DNA aptamers V7t1 and del5-1 (V7t1:del5-1) [23]. In particular, V7t1:del5-1 showed higher affinity towards VEGF165 than its monomeric components, with del5-1 attaching to the HBD part and V7t1 attaching to the RBD part [23]. V7t1 is a 25-mer aptamer with a G-quadruplex structure and was derived from Vap7 [23]. On the other hand, del5-1 is a 50-mer aptamer derived from VEa5, and it encompasses three stem-loop regions [26]. In the heterodimer, V7t1 and del5-1 are connected using 10 thymine nucleotides as a linker [23]. The structure of the bound complex formed by the aptamer heterodimer and VEGF165 is not known experimentally, primarily due to the high flexibility of the linkers present in both components. Even still, understanding the interactions between the aptamer heterodimer and VEGF165 will be indispensable for developing new aptamer heterodimers with improved properties. In the absence of experimental structures, in silico methods such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are useful tools [30,31,32]. The molecular docking approach facilitates the prediction of a ligand-binding site on the target molecule as well as the binding affinity and provides useful information on the position and orientation of the ligand [30]. Conversely, MD simulations capture the dynamic behavior of the ligand–target complex, providing useful information on stability, flexibility, and the associated conformational changes [31]. Additionally, end-point free energy methods [32,33,34] have been extensively utilized for calculating ligand–target binding free energies. They often use only the conformations in the free and bound states of the ligand and target and can be computationally less expensive than more rigorous alchemical- and pathway-based free energy methods [35,36,37]. Even though the end-point methods lack somewhat in accuracy compared to these rigorous methods, they can still offer higher accuracy than docking scoring functions [32]. With the above in mind, here we propose an ensemble docking approach for predicting an ensemble of complex structures of V7t1:del5-1 bound to VEGF165 by taking into account both small- and large-scale motions in both VEGF165 and the aptamer heterodimer. We first utilize anisotropic network model (ANM) analysis to gain insights into large-scale motions based on the lowest-frequency normal modes [38], followed by biased MD simulations to generate molecular structures considering these motions. In fact, identifying large-scale changes that typically involve low-frequency normal-mode motions in a complex system is a challenging task with atomistic MD. ANM can be a reasonable approach to generating large-scale collective motions occurring between the domains/monomers connected by a linker in both VEGF165 and the aptamer heterodimer. Through biased MD simulations, we obtain several conformations of VEGF165 and the aptamer heterodimer corresponding to their lowest-frequency normal modes. The obtained structures are then used for extraction based on ensemble docking, followed by unbiased MD simulations as well as binding free energy calculations based on molecul",PMC,neg,0,neg,6604,neg_PMC,0.014813886,0

In this study, the fibrous structure formation mechanism of soybean protein during high moisture extrusion processing was investigated using a dead-stop operation, and based on the interaction between soybean protein concentrate (SPC) and L-cysteine (CYS). The thermal properties, SDS-PAGE and particle size distribution of the samples from different extrusion zones were investigated. It was revealed that the addition of a moderate amount of CYS (0.1 %) promoted the fibrous structure formation in the SPC extrudates and optimised the textural properties of the SPC extrudates. In the extruder barrel, addition of CYS (0.1 %) promoted protein depolymerisation and unfolding in the mixing and cooking zones, and facilitated protein aggregation in the die and cooling zones. Protein solubility and raman spectroscopy revealed that disulfide bonds were principally responsible for fibrous structure formation; favoured when the intermolecular disulfide bonds (t-g-t mode) was increased. Finally, the transformation of protein conformation was revealed by secondary structure and surface hydrophobicity, which confirmed that the effect of CYS on protein conformation mainly occurred in the cooling zone.

The development of porous materials with flexible-robust characteristics shows some unique advantages to target high performance for gas separation, but remains a daunting challenge to achieve so far. Herein, we report a carboxyl-based hydrogen-bonded organic framework (ZJU-HOF-8a) with flexible-robust porosity for efficient purification of natural gas. ZJU-HOF-8a features a four-fold interpenetrated structure with dia topology, wherein abundant supramolecular entanglements are formed between the adjacent subnetworks through weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This structural configuration could not only stabilize the whole framework to establish the permanent porosity, but also enable the framework to show some flexibility due to its weak intermolecular interactions (so-called flexible-robust framework). The flexible-robust porosity of ZJU-HOF-8a was exclusively confirmed by gas sorption isotherms and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies, showing that the flexible pore pockets can be opened by C3H8 and n-C4H10 molecules rather by C2H6 and CH4. This leads to notably higher C3H8 and n-C4H10 uptakes with enhanced selectivities than C2H6 over CH4 under ambient conditions, affording one of the highest n-C4H10/CH4 selectivities. The gas-loaded single-crystal structures coupled with theoretical simulations reveal that the loading of n-C4H10 can induce an obvious framework expansion along with pore pocket opening to improve n-C4H10 uptake and selectivity, while not for C2H6 adsorption. This work suggests an effective strategy of designing flexible-robust HOFs for improving gas separation properties.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6613,neg_MEDLINE,0.0022650503,0
38678601,"Tubastatin alleviates epidural fibrosis via negatively targeting TGFβ/PI3K/Akt pathway. Epidural fibrosis (EF) is a chronic, progressive and severe disease. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) regulates biological signals and cell activities by deacetylating lysine residues and participates in TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Nevertheless, the effect and mechanism of HDAC6 in EF remain unclear. To investigate the effect and mechanism of HDAC6 inhibition on repressing epidural fibrosis. HDAC6 expression and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in normal human tissue and human EF tissue were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Human fibroblasts were treated with TGF-β ± HDAC6 inhibitors (Tubastatin) and fibrotic markers including collagen I, collagen III, α-SMA and fibronectin were assessed using western blotting. Then TGFβ1 receptor (TGFβ1-R), PI3K and Akt were analyzed using qRT-PCR and western blotting. Rats were undergone laminectomy± Tubastatin (intraperitoneally injection; daily for 7 days) and epidural scar extracellular matrix (ECM) expression was gauged using immunoblots. Increasing HDAC6 expression was associated with α-SMA enrichment. Tubastatin remarkably restrained TGF-β-induced level of collagen and ECM deposition in human fibroblasts, and the discovery was accompanied by decreased PI3K and Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, Tubastatin also inhibited TGF-β-mediated HIF-1α and VEGF expression. In the epidural fibrosis model, we found that Tubastatin weakened scar hyperplasia and collagen deposition, and effectively inhibited the process of epidural fibrosis. These results indicated that Tubastatin inhibited HDAC6 expression and decreased TGF-β/ PI3K/ Akt pathway that promotes collagen and ECM deposition and VEGF release, leading reduction of myofibroblast activation.

38686915,"Investigating the role of functional mutations in leucine binding to Sestrin2 in aging and age-associated degenerative pathologies using structural and molecular simulation approaches. Leucine is the native known ligand of Sestrin2 (Sesn2) and its interaction with Sesn2 is particularly important, as it influences the activity of mTOR in aging and its associated pathologies. It is important to find out how leucine interacts with Sesn2 and how mutations in the binding pocket of leucine affect the binding of leucine. Therefore, this study was committed to investigating the impact of non-synonymous mutations by incorporating a broad spectrum of simulation techniques, from molecular dynamics to free energy calculations. Our study was designed to model the atomic-scale interactions between leucine and mutant forms of Sesn2. Our results demonstrated that the interaction paradigm for the mutants has been altered thus showing a significant decline in the hydrogen bonding network. Moreover, these mutations compromised the dynamic stability by altering the conformational flexibility, sampling time, and leucine-induced structural constraints that consequently caused variation in the binding and structural stability. Molecular dynamics-based flexibility analysis revealed that the regions 217-339 and 371-380 demonstrated a higher fluctuation. Noteworthy, these regions correspond to a linker (217-339) and a loop (371-380) that cover the leucine binding cavity that is critical for the 'latch' mechanism in the N-terminal, which is essential for leucine binding. Further validation of reduced binding and modified internal motions caused by the mutants was obtained through binding free energy calculations, principal components analysis (PCA), and free energy landscape (FEL) analysis. By unraveling the molecular intricacies of Sesn2-leucine interactions and their mutations, we hope to pave the way for innovative strategies to combat the inevitable tide of aging and its associated diseases.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6639,neg_MEDLINE,0.014447853,0

Common in biomacromolecules, kinetically trapped misfolded intermediates are often detrimental to the structures, properties, or functions of proteins or nucleic acids. Nature employs chaperone proteins but not nucleic acids to escort intermediates to correct conformations. Herein, we constructed a Jablonski-like diagram of a mechanochemical cycle in which individual DNA hairpins were mechanically unfolded to high-energy states, misfolded into kinetically trapped states, and catalytically relaxed back to ground-state hairpins by a DNA chaperone. The capacity of catalytic relaxation was demonstrated in a 1D DNA hairpin array mimicking nanoassembled materials. At ≥1 μM, the diffusive (or self-walking) DNA chaperone converted the entire array of misfolded intermediates to correct conformation in less than 15 s, which is essential to rapidly prepare homogeneous nanoassemblies. Such an efficient self-walking amplification increases the signal-to-noise ratio, facilitating catalytic relaxation to recognize a 1 fM DNA chaperone in 10 min, a detection limit comparable to the best biosensing strategies.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6648,neg_MEDLINE,0.0020992733,0

The control over secondary structure has been widely studied to regulate the properties of polypeptide materials, which is used to change their functions in situ for various biomedical applications. Herein, we designed and constructed enzyme-responsive polypeptides as gating materials for mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), which underwent a distorted structure-to-helix transition to promote the release of encapsulated drugs. The polypeptide conjugated on the MSN surface adopted a negatively charged, distorted, flexible conformation, covering the pores of MSN to prevent drug leakage. Upon triggering by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) overproduced by tumor cells, the polypeptide transformed into positively charged, α-helical, rigid conformation with potent membrane-penetrating capabilities, which protruded from the MSN surface to uncover the pores. Such a transition thus enabled cancer-selective drug release and cellular internalization to efficiently kill tumor cells.

Structural changes induced by water play a pivotal role in chemistry and biology but remain challenging to predict, measure, and control at molecular level. Here we explore size-governed gas-phase water aggregation in the flexible molecule 4-hydroxy-2-butanone, modeling the conformational adaptability of flexible substrates to host water scaffolds and the preference for sequential droplet growth. The experiment was conducted using broadband rotational spectroscopy, rationalized with quantum chemical calculations. Two different isomers were observed experimentally from the di- to the pentahydrates (4-hydroxy-2-butanone-(H2O)n=2-5), including the 18O isotopologues for the di- and trihydrates. Interestingly, to accommodate water molecules effectively, the heavy atom skeleton of 4-hydroxy-2-butanone reshapes in every observed isomer and does not correspond to the stable conformer of the free monomer. All solvates initiate from the alcohol group (proton donor) but retain the carbonyl group as secondary binding point. The water scaffolds closely resemble those found in the pure water clusters, balancing between the capability of 4-hydroxy-2-butanone for steering the orientation and position of the water molecules and the ability of water to modulate the monomer's conformation. The present work thus provides an accurate molecular description on how torsionally flexible molecules dynamically adapt to water along progressing solvation.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6652,neg_MEDLINE,0.002406089,0
38756922,"Access to perinatal doula services in Medicaid: a case analysis of 2 states. INTRODUCTION. Maternal health indicators in the United States are highly inequitable. In 2021, the maternal mortality rate among non-Hispanic Black pregnant and postpartum people (PPP) was 2.6 times that among non-Hispanic White PPP. Severe maternal morbidity (SMM), a composite of 21 indicators reflecting end-organ dysfunction such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or infections, is prevalent among PPP, affecting over 50 000 US individuals every year and disproportionately affecting PPP of color. Evidence illuminating the positive impact of perinatal doula care on maternal health outcomes is strong and mounting. Yet, doulas are underutilized—in part, due to Medicaid reimbursement challenges. The goal of this study was to elucidate the complex process of adopting and sustaining policies covering doula care as a reimbursed health service in Medicaid. DOULA CARE. Doulas are nonclinical health care personnel who provide physical and emotional support to PPP during labor and childbirth, as well as during the postpartum period. Doulas offer information about possible pregnancy-, childbirth-, or postpartum-related complications; provide continuous companionship during labor; offer physiological pain-management techniques; and provide approaches to infant care and parental coping skills. Doulas can facilitate communication between patients and maternal health providers, empowering PPP to advocate for their health care preferences. Despite the benefits, nationwide utilization is low—around 6% annually. While many individuals desire doula care, low usage rates may be due, in part, to high out-of-pocket costs of doula care, precluding many low-income PPP from accessing it. Low rates may also relate to a low supply of culturally congruent, community-based doula care, which is important in achieving the aforementioned positive outcomes. Low supply may be partially attributable to the fact that doulas, who are typically paid on a fee-for-service basis and lack access to the benefits that salaried employees often have, may spend up to 11 times more time with clients than other providers and are not compensated for transportation costs and time spent “on call.”. MEDICAID AND DOULA SERVICES. Medicaid is the primary payer for 42% of US births, including 65% of births among Black PPP and 59% of births among Hispanic PPP. Moreover, Medicaid enrollees are more than 80% more likely than those with private health insurance coverage to experience SMM. Including doula care as a Medicaid-covered benefit could improve access to a critical maternal care intervention. Public and private payers infrequently reimburse for doula services. As of 2023, only 10 states reimbursed for doula services in Medicaid, and at varying rates. Challenges in state-level approaches to reimbursing for doula services remain, including determining doulas' scope of services (ie, identifying and defining prenatal vs postpartum vs full-spectrum doulas, as well as the extent to which doulas are perceived to express opinions or offer advice to their clients during labor and delivery and while in the presence of their provider[s]), ensuring accessibility of training, implementing standards for credentialing (ie, licensing or certification), addressing burdensome administrative requirements when enrolling as a Medicaid provider, and establishing and implementing equitable compensation rates. OBJECTIVE. A recent scoping review by our research team identified 5 key policy issues related to the implementation of Medicaid reimbursement for doula services: increasing doula workforce diversity, reducing administrative barriers to doulas' service provision, determining the value of doula services and facilitating adequate compensation, developing sustainable funding models, and strengthening partnerships between policymakers and the doula community. Resolving these issues is integral to implementing and sustaining Medicaid reimbursement for doula care but is complicated by the exigencies of policymaking in each state. To understand how the policy issues identified in the scoping review are playing out, we examined the implementation of Medicaid reimbursement for doula services in 2 states: Oregon, the state with the longest-standing Medicaid reimbursement policy, and Massachusetts, where, at the time of writing, a policy was about to be implemented. In terms of the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework, the states represent 2 phases of implementation: Sustainment and Preparation, respectively. The definition of EPIS phases framed the sampling and comparison of the 2 state case studies. FRAMEWORK. In this study, EPIS defines external factors, relationships among stakeholders, and inner contextual factors that affect the implementation of social policies in complex settings, such as Medicaid, at successive stages. In the first, Exploration, multiple interested parties—state agencies, independent health policy groups, and service providers—define a new policy as they become aware of an unmet need as well as a policy option addressing it. Exploration may lead to Preparation to adopt that policy, ascertaining barriers and facilitators of implementation, assessing adaptation needs, and developing a plan to mitigate potential barriers and capitalize on potential facilitators. In Implementation, implementers discover whether efforts made during Preparation addressed potential issues; in Sustainment, the policy becomes engrained, a process that typically involves funding and ongoing monitoring and evaluation. Each phase is affected by the outer context, or policy environment; the inner context, or stakeholders' diverse interests and prior relationships; bridging factors, including the involvement of intermediary stakeholders or agreements to manage diverse interests; and innovation factors, characteristics of the policy and the policy's compatibility with established practices.

38761771,"Modification of myofibrillar protein structural characteristics: Effect of ultrasound-assisted first-stage thermal treatment on unwashed Silver Carp surimi gel. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT. 1. INTRODUCTION. Surimi, a protein-rich food derived from minced fish, has attracted significant attention due to its distinctive gel properties, especially in light of rising living standards, thus contributing to its increasing popularity [1]. In traditional surimi processing, washing plays a vital role. While it enhances gel properties and eliminates impurities effectively, excessive washing may lead to nutrient loss and environmental pollution concerns [2]. Consequently, the development of unwashed surimi products with gel properties comparable to those of washed counterparts has emerged as a central focus of contemporary research. Ultrasound, a widely used physical processing technique, has garnered extensive application in protein gel fields, including surimi, due to non-pollution, safety and ease of operation [3]. The cavitation effects of ultrasound have been demonstrated to induce the conformational unfolding of muscle protein, thereby exposing more active sites on the surface. This process facilitates molecular interactions between proteins and promotes the formation of high-quality elastic gels [4]. Ultrasound can be classified into two types: high-frequency low-intensity ultrasound (100 kHz − 1 MHz, power 1 W cm−2) and low-frequency high-intensity (16–100 kHz, power 10–1000 W cm−2) [5]. The shrimp surimi was been pretreated in an ultrasonic processor at a frequency of 20 kHz, the network of gel was denser, improving the elasticity and stability of shrimp surimi [3]. It could be a potential way to improve the product gel quality. However, the probe type high-intensity ultrasound was commonly used, which has equipment limitations and is not suitable for practical production. In addition, using probe type or groove type high-intensity ultrasound alone is insufficient for enhancing protein gel quality, especially for myofibrillar protein gel [6]. Therefore, the exploration of strategies to optimize the ultrasound effect is of utmost importance. A common thermal process of surimi is a two-stage water bath heating at 40 °C for 30–60 min (gelation) followed by 90 °C for 20–30 min (gel ripening) [7]. Long-term incubation at low temperature (under 50 °C) contributes to enhancing the ability to form gel, and the gel ripening increases in the hardness and elasticity of the gel at 80–90 °C [8]. During the thermal process, assistance with ultrasound treatment, has the potential to improve gel quality. According to reports, ultrasound treatment has the effect of unfolding the secondary molecular structure, exposing internal lysine residues and increasing the binding sites for transglutaminase, which could contribute to better cross-linking in gelling [9]. Recently, Wang, et al. [4] found that compared with the traditional water bath heating, moderate ultrasound treatment facilitated the formation of compact and homogenous gel networks with small pores. He, et al. [10] have also observed a similar phenomenon, wherein the incorporation of ultrasound-assisted water bath heating during the suwari and gel setting stages contribute to the formation of denser gel microstructures with diminutive holes, leading to significant enhancements in textural properties and water retention of surimi gels. As a crucial moment for gel formation, the first-stage water bath heating at 40 °C assisted ultrasound treatment may contribute to improving the quality of surimi gel was rarely reported. In this study, investigating the influence of ultrasound-assisted first-stage thermal treatment on the gelation properties of unwashed Silver Carp surimi gel was the main objective. The changes in the gel properties of surimi gel after two-stage water bath heating with different treatment time were determined using gel strength, texture profile analysis (TPA), water holding capacity (WHC), combining the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). During the two-stage water bath heating process, the formation of surimi gel is intricately linked to protein unfolding, cross-linking, and intricate adjustments in its properties. To investigate the mechanism of ultrasound-assisted first-stage thermal-induced gelation effects on unwashed surimi gel properties, the particle size, secondary structure, and sulfhydryl group content changes of Hypophthalmichthys molitrix myofibrillar protein (HMP) were measured during two-stage water bath heating. This study would contribute valuable insights into the application of ultrasound-assisted first-stage thermal treatment for the production of high-quality unwashed surimi products. 2.

38763943,"Nondestructive quantification of internal raster path for additively manufactured components via ultrasonic testing. INTRODUCTION. Additive Manufacturing (AM) is an increasingly popular set of processes for fabricating complex three dimensional objects and applications of this practice are providing advanced product design in the manufacturing industry. In fused filament fabrication (FFF), the additive manufacturing technology employed in the present study, a fusion-based material extrusion process is carried out by melting a polymer filament in a heated nozzle and depositing the molten layers onto previously deposited layers or directly onto the heated built plate. Continued advances with CAD, CAM and CNC cutting technologies have helped to grow the rapid prototyping process and make it more efficient while allowing for tighter manufacturing tolerances (see e.g.,). The molten layers cool rapidly and harden, forming a three-dimensional part established by a pre-defined nozzle path (see e.g.,). Many materials used for FFF are commercially available plastics, with two of the most commonly used being acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). There are other polymers available in filament form such as, polycarbonate (PC), polycaprolactone (PCL), polyetherimide (PEI), polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and polyether ketone ketone (PEKK). When fabricating a component using the FFF process, the nozzle deposits individual lines or beads on the print bed. These individual beads are known as rasters, with raster orientation, also called build orientation, being defined as the print bead direction with respect to a given axis. This orientation may change both within a deposited layer and between layers based upon the design needs. The final part performance of the additively manufactured part will be a function of the choice of material systems and the printing orientation, among other process parameters. As such, researchers have demonstrated that the raster orientation of the component changes the fabricated part strength (see e.g.,). Several process parameters often considered in design are the build orientation, layer thickness, raster width, raster angle, air gap, etc., affecting both the final part dimensionality and distortion within the part (see e.g.,). The deleterious effects of these parameters often result in an AM component that has poorly defined anisotropic characteristics. One of the most influential of these parameters, the aforementioned raster orientation, plays a significant role as it affects the build time, the required support structure and dimensional accuracy (see e.g.,). In addition, literature has shown that varying the raster orientation has a significant impact on the resultant mechanical, fracture and failure properties of a 3D printed object (see e.g.,). For example, in a part with a 0°/90° repeating raster angle, the tensile and bending strengths are, respectively 56.6 MPa and 56.1 MPa, whereas the same part and material system with a 45°/ − 45° repeating raster angle able yielded a tensile strength and bending strength of, respectively, 43.3 MPa and 43.2 MPa. It was observed the raster oriented parallel to the load direction created the samples with the highest hardness and stiffness (see e.g.,). Yap et al. investigated the effects of raster angles and orientations on the elastic properties of a 3D printed PC-ABS material. They presented a method to determine the effective orthotropic elastic constants by NDT testing and found to be in good agreement with the experimental results for the simple orientations studied (all 0° and 0°/90° repeating). Prajapati et al. identified diminished properties in the build direction will occur for various orientations. In Prajapeti et al. they demonstrated a technique to mitigate the loss in performance through a thermal annealing process. Es-Said et al. also studied the interlayer bonding and demonstrated that because of the weak interlayer adhesion for their test samples fabricated with a 0° orientation, rupture occurred at the individual layer steps. The work of Es-Said et al. also discussed the phase change occurring when the semi-molten filament extrudes and solidifies in a chamber during deposition and variations in the material contraction or the respective layers increase the likelihood of triggering a fragile interlayer connection. As such, the significant mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and flexural strength, are functions of the relative orientation patterns. There is a considerable breadth of literature in the scientific community focused on the structural impact of the raster orientation within the additively manufactured component highlighting the importance of non-destructively identifying the as manufactured raster orientation and relative alignments of individual rasters (see e.g.,). To date, there has been limited work investigating the uses of ultrasonic inspection of FFF components, most of which has focused on either manufacturing or in-service damage. Among all NDT techniques it was found computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonic testing (UT) are the most effective inspection methods (see e.g.,). Lee et al. presented an ultrasonic approach to identify various embedded voids within an additively manufactured component with a specific focus on porosity. Na and Oneida presented a through-transmission immersion approach for inspection of FFF components and studied various defects, such as delamination and embedded voids using a reference standard approach. Poudel et al. used a pulse-echo UT testing method coupled with digital image correlation to characterize the defects within carbon fiber reinforced epoxy (CFRP) panels during loading. Phased array ultrasound (PAUT) was employed to identify service induced damage within a CFRP.

38777381,"Magnesium ions mitigate metastable states in the regulatory landscape of mRNA elements. INTRODUCTION. Riboswitches are structured RNA elements located in the 5′-untranslated regions of bacterial mRNAs. They can regulate the transcription or translation of downstream mRNAs in response to the specific binding of small molecules. To date, three purine-sensing riboswitches have been discovered, which sense adenine (Mandal and Breaker 2004), guanine (Mandal et al. 2003), or 2′-deoxyguanosine (2′-dG) (Kim et al. 2007). Their characterization has helped elucidate mechanisms of gene regulation by riboswitches. The 2′-dG riboswitch is a close variant of the guanine-sensing riboswitches (Kim et al. 2007). Biochemical and phylogenetic analyses of this family have indicated that the metabolite-binding aptamer domain adopts a distinct organization of three helices (P1, P2, and P3) around the three-way junction, which serves as the ligand-binding pocket (Fig. 1; Mandal et al. 2003; Mandal and Breaker 2004; Kim et al. 2007). These purine-sensing riboswitches also share similar 3D structures. The P1 helix from the riboswitch aptamer domain, whose two strands are distal in sequence, can either aid in the formation of the ligand-binding pocket or form an alternative helix with a downstream sequence, forming the expression platform and switching the conformation of the riboswitch between the ON and OFF states. The P2 and P3 helices both have stem–loop structures. Their loop regions, L2 and L3, interact with each other to form tertiary contacts constituting the pseudoknot (PK) interaction. In terms of function, the purine-sensing riboswitches encompass a diverse mode of riboswitch-mediated gene regulation. The xpt-pbuX Bacillus subtilis riboswitch regulates gene expression by acting as a transcriptional OFF switch (Mandal et al. 2003), whereas the pbuE Bacillus subtilis riboswitch controls the downstream genes as a transcriptional ON switch (Mandal and Breaker 2004). On the other hand, the addVV Vibrio cholerae riboswitch is a translational ON switch (Wacker et al. 2011). The 2′-dG riboswitch transcriptionally regulates the gene encoding the ribonucleotide reductase subunit β (Kim et al. 2007; Wacker et al. 2011), where the ligand, 2′-dG, is base-paired to residue C80 positioned at J31 (Pikovskaya et al. 2011), as elucidated by the crystal structure. NMR studies suggest that the ON–OFF states are regulated by breaking the P1 helix and forming a new helix between part of the P1 helix and the expression platform of the riboswitch in the absence of ligand binding during the transcription process (Helmling et al. 2017, 2018). To fully understand the riboswitch operation, it is crucial to understand how the structure (Pikovskaya et al. 2011) and the mode of regulation (Kim et al. 2007) of the downstream genes depend on the subtle structural modulation of the aptamer domain of the riboswitch, especially the P1 helix. In terms of molecular simulation studies, explicit-solvent simulations have been applied to the SAM-sensing aptamer domain, revealing the glassy behavior of Mg2+ surrounding the RNA molecule and the general mechanism of Mg2+ mediation of RNA fluctuation (Hayes et al. 2012). Later, by the combination of SHAPE probing (selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) experiments and GEM (generalized electrostatic model) simulations (Hayes et al. 2015), the change in dynamics between the conformational ensembles characterizing the free state of the SAM-sensing aptamer domain and the SAM-bound complex have been mapped and revealed key insights into structural preorganization and Mg2+ requirements for ligand binding at nucleotide resolution (Roy et al. 2019). Here, we investigate, in detail, the effect of the Mg2+ ion concentration on the ligand-free aptamer structure and the ligand-induced RNA folding pathway of the aptamer domain of the 2′-dG riboswitch from Mesoplasma forum (mfl-aptamer). To quantitatively capture the nonlinear effects of ligand and Mg2+ binding, the apo and holo structures of the mfl-aptamer (Fig. 1) were investigated by both detailed explicit-solvent simulations and SHAPE probing experiments in the wetlab. Our computational and experimental studies have provided a structural basis for the RNA aptamer response to the Mg2+ concentration and ligand needed for the recognition of the 2′-dG, suggesting potential pathways of conformation changes. In particular, our study reveals that both ligand and Mg2+ are required for a well-funneled energy landscape for the mfl-aptamer. We show how ligand binding stabilizes the P1 helix, the junction region, and the riboswitch core by inducing a more compact core. We also show how Mg2+ binding stabilizes these regions by bridging negatively charged RNA backbone regions. Mg2+ helps to reduce the frustration of the system and remodel the energy landscape by forming specific interactions. Importantly, the binding of ligand directly eliminates the metastable states and remodels the energy landscape into a single basin. The study of the stability of the P1 helix also helps to shed light on the conformational change mechanism between transcription OFF and ON states for the entire 2′-dG riboswitch, of which the P1 helix destabilization plays a major role. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the combined effects of ligand binding and Mg2+ on the mfl-aptamer at the atomistic level with a full physical model accompanied by detailed experiments at nucleotide resolution. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. LIGAND AND MG2+ MEDIATION OF GLOBAL AND LOCAL FLUCTUATIONS IS CAPTURED BY EXPLICIT-SOLVENT SIMULATIONS. GLOBAL FLUCTUATIONS. Six conditions combining three different Mg2+ concentrations and the absence and presence of ligand have been studied with explicit-solvent simulations.

38785647,"QUBO Problem Formulation of Fragment-Based Protein-Ligand Flexible Docking. 1. INTRODUCTION. Computational methods have been widely employed in the field of drug discovery. Structure-based drug discovery (SBDD) involves exploring potential drug candidate compounds using tertiary structures of a target protein. Unlike ligand-based drug discovery, which relies on characteristics of known active compounds, structure-based drug discovery can find drug candidates with novel scaffolds. Protein–ligand docking is widely used in SBDD. This calculation estimates the binding pose between the protein and the chemical compound (as a candidate for strongly interacting ligand) with their estimated binding free energy. The performance of the docking calculation depends on (1) the effectiveness of the binding pose search algorithm and (2) the accuracy of the scoring function used to estimate the binding free energy. Various docking tools have been proposed over many years [1,2,3,4]. In particular, the search for compound binding poses must consider numerous internal degrees of freedom of the compound as well as its translation and rotation. However, exhaustive exploration of binding poses (including translation, rotation, and internal degree of freedom) cannot be handled in a realistic amount of time, and various heuristic strategies are employed. For instance, AutoDock 4, developed at the Scripps Research institute, utilizes the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm [5]. AutoDock Vina was developed as a successor to AutoDock and estimates binding poses using an iterated local search optimizer that conducts local optimization and compound conformation mutation repeatedly [6,7]. Additionally, Glide is a widely used commercial tool that performs an exhaustive search while gradually excluding unpromising binding pose candidates by several filters (such as site-point search, diameter test, and subset test) [8,9]. Another binding pose search strategy is fragment-based docking, wherein the compound is decomposed into fragments (chemical substructures which have no internal degrees of freedom), and the binding poses of the compounds are reconstructed after separately processing each fragment. For example, FlexX [10] utilizes an incremental construction algorithm placing the first fragment in the protein pocket and extending new fragments from it. REstretto [11] utilizes relative positions of fragments with enumerating feasible compound conformers, resulting in rapid and comprehensive exploration. eHiTS [12] constructs a graph representing covalent bonds and clashes between a vast number of candidate fragment placements. It subsequently performs maximum clique finding to obtain combinations of fragment placements that form consistent compound structures. Decomposing compounds into fragments has a significant advantage that has fewer unique fragments owing to the commonality of fragments across compounds, leading to a faster calculation. Zsoldos et al. [12] reported four times faster calculation with the reuse of the intermediate results. This approach is promising given the recent exponential growth in compound library size; for example, the number of compounds in the ZINC database was approximately 34 million in 2012 [13] and 1.4 billion in 2020 [14]. The strategy of eHiTS involves transforming docking calculations to a combinatorial optimization problem to find a set of fragment placements which is consistent as a compound structure through maximum clique finding. While many important combinatorial optimization problems are NP-hard and difficult to solve, efforts were recently made to find optimal solutions for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems rapidly using an Ising machine after mapping the problem to an Ising model [15]. Various implementation approaches are proposed for the Ising machine, such as D-Wave Systems Inc.’s quantum computer based on quantum annealing [16,17], NTT research Inc.’s Coherent Ising Machine (an optical computer) [18], and implementations on classical computers powered by graphics processing units (GPUs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), such as NEC’s vector annealing, Fujitsu’s Digital Annealer [19], and Toshiba Digital Solutions Corporation’s SQBM+, which is based on the simulated bifurcation algorithm (SB algorithm) [20]. The quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem is a kind of optimization problem that can be transformed to the ground state search problem on the Ising model. Examples of combinatorial optimization problems that have been formulated as QUBO problems include the traveling salesperson problem [17] and the polyomino puzzle [16,21,22,23]. In particular, Takabatake et al. [23] have explored the generalized version of polyomino puzzles involving the use of various sizes of two-dimensional polyomino pieces, and three-dimensional polycubes. They also suggest its potential applications in drug discovery. Research on applying the Ising machine to drug discovery has begun. Sakaguchi et al. [24] modeled a compound placement problem where all correct atom positions in the docking pose are precisely given and only atom type assignments are unknown. Banchi et al. [25] proposed a method for matching known interaction sites of proteins with compound structures. They utilized a Gaussian boson sampler to sample many initial solutions, followed by shrinking and expansion of the matching using classical computational methods. Their approach superimposed the rigid compound structure onto the protein surface. Zha et al. [26] performed structure matching for computationally estimated interaction points of proteins with compound structures. They matched the relative distances between the rigid compound’s atomic positions and the interaction points of the protein, followed by the superimposition of them. However, the problem setting of Sakaguchi et al. assumed that the relative positions of the protein and compound are already known.

38786537,"Clinical Experience Comparison of Foreign-Trained Dentists and Domestic Dental Students: One Institution's Experience. 1. INTRODUCTION. Healthcare professionals from across the globe with diverse backgrounds and training come to the United States (U.S.) in hopes of furthering their education and ultimately seeking employment in this country. These hopefuls include foreign-trained dentists (FTDs). Dental institutions began enrolling foreign-trained dentists in modified predoctoral programs as early as the 1970s [1]. Many different pathways exist for the FTDs to matriculate in U.S. dental institutions [2,3], including enrollment in an advanced program or international dental programs (IDPs). Currently, 41 of 71 dental schools offer an International Dental Program (IDP) to FTDs. Approximately 600 FTDs matriculate into IDPs in the U.S. annually [4]. According to the Institute of International Education, the U.S. has been the main destination for most of these foreign-trained students seeking to further their education and research [5]. Based on a self-reported study, the majority of FTDs have improved their knowledge and clinical skills after completion of their programs [6]. Studies on the topic of FTDs mainly focus on the selection and prediction of academic performances [7], including challenges FTDs face when applying to various IDPs and possible pathways for pursuing dental careers in the United States [2]. However, there is limited evidence on the educational and clinical outcomes of these programs. FTDs in IDPs have diverse cultural backgrounds. The majority of FTDs who have sought additional training in the U.S. originated from Asia, followed by Eastern Europe, Africa, and Central or South America [6,8]. Previous abroad dental educational experiences may impact the FTDs’ didactic and clinical performance during their matriculation and progression through U.S. dental schools. Non-U.S. dental institutions possess distinct didactic and clinic curricula, as well as educational pedagogies, all of which may impact the fundamental knowledge and clinical performance of FTD students within their IDPs [9]. For instance, some FTDs may have never been exposed to advanced technology during their previous dental training. However, a 2012 study found that when comparing the National Dental Examining Board and Objective Structured Clinical Exam results [10], there was no significant difference between FTDs and traditional students. FTDs seem to be able to transfer previous knowledge, skills, and experiences to progress through IDP programs and acquire the necessary knowledge [6,11]. Data on the clinical experiences of FTDs during their training in IDPs are limited, especially within the context of program length. Dental schools in the U.S. have developed modified IDP curricula ranging from 24 months to 48 months [2,5]. However, the program time allocation may not be evidence-driven. Further outcome assessments are needed on FTDs’ clinical experiences, clinical performance, and written examination results as compared with traditional dental students to help develop a more comprehensive curriculum for FTD students in U.S. dental schools. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the clinical aspect of the IDP at the University of Illinois Chicago, College of Dentistry (UIC-COD) and (2) compare the clinical experiences of FTDs enrolled in the Advanced Standing DMD Program (DMDAS) versus the traditional DMD program. 1.1. PRECLINICAL CURRICULUM FOR UIC-COD DMDAS STUDENTS. At the UIC-COD, within a span of 28 months, all DMDAS students are provided with robust training to ensure full engagement and a rich experience in comprehensive patient care, extramural programs, enhanced readiness to challenge regional licensure examinations, and time to engage in research and scholarly activity. During the first eight months, the DMDAS students focus on traditional first- and second-year preclinical activities and comprehensive care courses that integrate foundational knowledge and clinical learning. All DMDAS students, regardless of their past dental experience, meet all preclinical course objectives in an accelerated fashion, asynchronous from the traditional DMD students. The course load during the preclinical semesters is heavy, as many competencies are met in preparation for entry into the clinic. At the end of the preclinical training, all DMDAS students acquire skills and knowledge comparable to the DMD students before they are promoted into the clinics. 1.2. CLINICAL CURRICULUM FOR UIC-COD STUDENTS. At UIC-COD, student competency is assessed based on input from various sources via a holistic modified portfolio, referred to as the UIC-COD Competency Model. Information on students’ performance and progression towards clinical competency is gathered using the following four metrics: (1) Faculty Observation, (2) Self-Evaluations, (3) Capstone Appraisal Procedures (CAPs), and (4) Varied Experiences. Upon the completion of the predoctoral dental program, with the use of the data points acquired from this competency model, the faculty can assess overall competency and predict the graduate’s readiness to practice independently, beginning general dentistry. Faculty Observation: Each student’s patient encounter in the clinic is assessed by a calibrated faculty member daily. The faculty member evaluates the student based on seven clinical domains (Professionalism, Ethical Behavior, Cultural Competence; Dialogue; Assessment; Differential Diagnosis; Treatment Plan; Intervention; and Evaluation of Outcomes) with respect to progression towards clinical competency, and records the evaluation in the electronic health record. Each domain has a defined grading rubric, and all clinical faculty members are calibrated to he assessment using the rubric. At the end of the semester, all faculty members who have worked with a student provide the student a summative grade, with formative feedback in the form of comments.

38823863,"Impact of pilot-scale microfluidization on soybean protein structure in powder and solution. The effect of microfluidization treatment on the primary, secondary, and tertiary structure of soybean protein isolate (SPI) was investigated. The samples were treated with and without controlling the temperature and circulated in the system 1, 3, and 5 times at high pressure (137 MPa). Then, the treated samples were freeze-dried and reconstituted in water to check the impact of the microfluidization on two different states: powder and solution. Regarding the primary structure, the SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions showed that the protein bands remained unchanged when exposed to microfluidization treatment. When the temperature was controlled for the samples in their powder state, a significant decrease in the quantities of β-sheet and random coil and a slight reduction in α-helix content was noticed. The observed decrease in β-sheet and the increase in β-turns in treated samples indicated that microfluidization may lead to protein unfolding, opening the hydrophobic regions. Additionally, a lower amount of α-helix suggests a higher protein flexibility. After reconstitution in water, a significant difference was observed only in α-helix, β-sheet and β-turn.

The changes of physicochemical, structural and functional properties and the lysinoalanine (LAL) formation during the unfolding and refolding of black soldier fly larvae albumin (BSFLA) induced by acid/alkaline pH shift were explored. The results showed that acid/alkaline conditions induced unfolding of BSFLA structure, but also accompanied by the formation of some large aggregates due to the hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and disulfide bonds. Compared with control or pH1.5 shift, pH12 shift treatment significantly increased the electrostatic repulsion, surface hydrophobicity, free sulfhydryl group, and deamidation reactions, but reduced the fluorescence intensity of BSFLA, and these change in protein conformation contributed to increase in solubility, emulsion activity, and emulsion stability. But the content of LAL in BSFLA was increased by 93.39 % by pH 12 shift treatment. In addition, pH1.5 shift modified BSFLA tended to form β-sheet structure through unfolding and refolding, resulting in the formation of aggregates with larger particle sizes, and reducing the solubility and the LAL content by 7.93 % and 65.53 %, respectively.

38895475,"Stick-slip unfolding favors self-association of expanded HTT mRNA. INTRODUCTION. Huntington’s Disease (HD), a fatal neurodegeneration, is caused by expansion of the CAG repeats located in the first exon of the huntingtin (HTT) gene, in which disease severity and age of onset strongly correlate with the number of CAG repeats . Aggregation of the polyglutamine-containing HTT protein has been extensively studied . Emerging evidence, however, suggests that toxicity of the expanded (exp) HTT mRNA also contributes to disease . Firstly, RNAs containing expanded CAG tracts form nuclear or perinuclear aggregates , and transcription is neurotoxic even when the RNA cannot be translated . Secondly, a genome wide association study (GWAS) revealed that the length of the uninterrupted CAG repeat tract, rather than polyQ tract length, is the primary determinant of HD age of onset . Furthermore, cellular models of HD have shown that expHTT mRNA self-associates into foci that sequester the splicing regulatory protein, MBNL1, and other RNA-binding proteins . Physical properties that promote RNA aggregation and protein sequestration have been difficult to study because the repetitive sequence adopt many structures. RNAs with 12–15 CAG trinucleotide repeats form hairpins containing A-A mismatches that may ‘slip’ into alternative alignments of the opposing strands, exposing a variable number of single-stranded triplets. In simulations, these unpaired CAG triplets seed inter-strand base pairs , explaining why phase separation propensity increases with the number of CAG triplets . Sequences flanking the CAG repeats in HTT also affect mRNA structure and may contribute to repeat expansion toxicity. Chemical probing experiments showed that 7–9 flanking CCG proline codons in HTT mRNA base pair with CAG triplets, forming a composite hairpin at the base of the stem (Fig. 1A). The CCG repeats increase the melting temperature of the RNA by ~15°C compared to pure CAG repeats of identical length . It is unknown how CAG-CCG base pairs alter interactions between RNA strands. Why neurodegeneration rises around a threshold of 36 CAG repeats, and why some CAG expansion mutations are toxic whereas others are not, remain long-standing questions . To address these challenges, we probed the folding and unfolding of normal and expanded HTT mRNA using single-molecule force spectroscopy with optical tweezers that detect unfolding of a few base pairs at a time and resolve heterogeneous folding pathways . Our results show how continuous, non-cooperative slippage of CAG base pairs hampers complete refolding of expHTT mRNA. ‘Sticky’ interactions with the adjacent CCG trinucleotides stabilize partially slipped structures containing unpaired CAG repeats. The exposed single-strands readily initiate inter-strand base pairing, supporting models in which single-stranded CAG repeats drive phase separation and aggregation of CAG repeat RNA . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. FORCE SPECTROSCOPY RESOLVES HTT RNA FOLDING INTERMEDIATES. To investigate HTT mRNA structures by force spectroscopy, fragments of human HTT exon 1 (fHTT) RNA spanning the CAG repeat region were joined with dsDNA handles and attached to polystyrene beads held by optical traps (Fig. 1A). The mRNA fragments contained 7–40 CAG codons, the adjacent CCG-CAA-(CCG)7 codons, and an additional 20 nt HTT sequence flanking the trinucleotide repeats (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1). Tethered fHTT mRNAs were repeatedly stretched and relaxed at a constant speed, yielding force extension curves (FECs) that revealed the size and mechanical stability of the mRNA structures (Fig. 1B). Fitting an extensible worm-like chain (eWLC) model to the data yielded the changes in contour length (Lc) upon unfolding and refolding (see Methods and Fig. 1B), the forces at which unfolding and refolding occur (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. S2) and the cooperativity of each transition (Supplementary Fig. S3). mRNA containing 7 CAG triplets (fHTT7), within the non-pathogenic range, exhibited near-equilibrium, cooperative unfolding and refolding transitions at 11.8 ± 0.56 pN (Fig. 1B). However, the distribution of contour length changes associated with these transitions ranged from 18.2 nm to 29.7 nm compared to 25.96 nm expected for unfolding of the predicted minimal free energy (MFE) hairpin. This difference is explained by smaller transitions below ~ 7 pN (Fig. 1B inset), indicating that fHTT7 mRNA populates ‘slipped’ structures before unfolding completely at higher force. To evaluate these slipped structures, we fitted each FEC with a series of eWLC models to determine the contour length change relative to Lc of the predicted MFE structure (ΔLcMFE) which is comprised of base paired CAG-CCG triplets plus one unpaired CAG (Supplementary Fig. S4). The distribution of ΔLcMFE at low tension peaked at values that differed by multiples of one single-stranded trinucleotide (~1.77 nm; Fig. 1C and Table S2). This length change agreed well with ‘slipped’ conformations of both shorter and longer contour lengths than the predicted MFE structure (Fig. 1C). Control experiments showed that these low force transitions did not arise from transitions in the HTT nucleotides flanking the repeat region (Supplementary Fig. S5). The FECs were not well described by sequential opening of the hairpin, indicating that the CAG/CCG repeat hairpin slips rather than partially unfolds at low forces. The presence of slipped intermediates before the main unfolding transition was supported by two populations of the unfolding and refolding forces (Fig. 1D): transitions centered around 11.8 ± 0.56 pN were almost exclusively associated with cooperative unfolding of the fHTT7 hairpin, whereas transitions at ~ 6.9 ± 1 pN corresponded to ‘slippage’ of one to four CAG repeats. Thus, an unexpanded HTT mRNA folds cooperatively into a hairpin that is stabilized by base pairs between CAG and CCG triplets. Yet, even this short mRNA samples different structures resulting from slippage of base pairs within the repeat region",PMC,neg,0,neg,6743,neg_PMC,0.692096,1
38898102,"Multivalent interactions of the disordered regions of XLF and XRCC4 foster robust cellular NHEJ and drive the formation of ligation-boosting condensates in vitro. In mammalian cells, DNA double-strand breaks are predominantly repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). During repair, the Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer (Ku), X-ray repair cross complementing 4 (XRCC4) in complex with DNA ligase 4 (X4L4) and XRCC4-like factor (XLF) form a flexible scaffold that holds the broken DNA ends together. Insights into the architectural organization of the NHEJ scaffold and its regulation by the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) were recently obtained by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy analysis. However, several regions, especially the C-terminal regions (CTRs) of the XRCC4 and XLF scaffolding proteins, have largely remained unresolved in experimental structures, which hampers the understanding of their functions. Here we used magnetic resonance techniques and biochemical assays to comprehensively characterize the interactions and dynamics of the XRCC4 and XLF CTRs at residue resolution. We show that the CTRs of XRCC4 and XLF are intrinsically disordered and form a network of multivalent heterotypic and homotypic interactions that promotes robust cellular NHEJ activity. Importantly, we demonstrate that the multivalent interactions of these CTRs lead to the formation of XLF and X4L4 condensates in vitro, which can recruit relevant effectors and critically stimulate DNA end ligation.

38902609,"Arabidopsis AGB1 participates in salinity response through bZIP17-mediated unfolded protein response. BACKGROUND. Like every one of us, plants are facing an ever-changing environment day by day. Adjusting the armory to cope with divergent stresses is essential to equip seedlings with proper transcriptome for their fitness [1]. Integrating external stimuli into plant cells depends on hormones and heterotrimeric G proteins to deliver messages and initiate proper cellular responses for better survival [2]. The heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein), including G⍺, Gβ, and Gγ subunits, serves as a signal mediator coupling with the plasma membrane-spanning G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and effectors [3]. The human genome contains 23 G⍺ genes, 5 Gβ genes and 11 Gγ genes [4]. By contrast, Arabidopsis genome contains one canonical G PROTEIN ALPHA SUBUNIT 1 (GPA1) [5] and three non-canonical G⍺ subunits EXTRA-LARGE G-PROTEIN 1 (XLG1) [6], XLG2 and XLG3 [4], one Gβ subunit GTP BINDING PROTEIN BETA 1 (AGB1) [7] and three Gγ subunits G-PROTEIN GAMMA-SUBUNIT 1 (AGG1) [8], AGG2 [9], AGG3 [10]. Previous studies have shown that heterotrimeric G protein subunits play vital roles in responses to developmental cues and environmental stresses, including salt stress [11]. Soil salinity is one of the major threats to food security by seriously attenuating plant growth and decreasing crop yield [12]. Excessive salt in the soil causes numerous negative effects on different plant developmental stages, including germination, vegetative growth, and flowering [13]. These negative effects damage plant cells due to ion toxicity and increasing osmotic stress [14, 15]. Accordingly, plants have employed various mechanisms for survival in harsh salinity environments. Three signaling pathways constitute the major transduction during salt stress: calcium-dependent signaling pathway that (1) triggers the activation of stress-responsive genes as dehydration-responsive or late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins [16] and (2) salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway for regulation of ion homeostasis [17], and (3) osmotic stress signaling pathway involving ABA-dependent induction of downstream salt responsive genes through activation of a group of transcription factors like bZIP, NAC, MYB and ABRE families [18]. However, our understanding of the whole network of pathways regulating salinity response is far from complete. Recent research based on studies of Arabidopsis AGB1 has suggested a functional link between plant G protein signaling and regulation of the salt stress response. A knockout mutant of AGB1 exhibited more sensitivity to high salinity than wild-type plants [10, 11, 19–21]. Under excessive salt, the agb1 mutant accumulates more Na+, translocate more Na+ from root to shoot, and has a high transpiration rate with larger stomatal apertures [22, 23]; AGB1 is also coupled with AGG1 or AGG2 to regulate stomatal apertures and transpiration [24]. Meanwhile, a receptor-like kinase, FERONIA (FER), has been identified by directed interaction with AGB1. FER is required for cell wall integrity, Ca2+ induction, ROS production, and stomata movement under salinity conditions [25]. Most G protein signaling studies have focused on canonical effectors localized to the plasma membrane. Recent studies have shown that the G-protein β subunit functions in the nucleus [23, 26]. The Arabidopsis AGB1 is localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with B-BOX DOMAIN PROTEIN 21 (BBX21) for hypocotyl elongation [27], with BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) for cell division [28], with PHYTOCHROME B (phyB)—PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3 (PIF3) [29] or CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1)—ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) for photomorphogenesis [30] and with MAP KINASE 6 (MPK6) for drought tolerance [31]. Nonetheless, gaining evidence showed that WD domain-containing proteins, including AGB1, directly interacted with bZIP transcription factors like HY5 and VIRE2-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (VIP1) to regulate gene expressions [30, 31]. The basic leucine zippers transcription (bZIP) family in Arabidopsis comprised 78 members and assorted into 13 groups [32]. bZIPs form as dimers to bind DNA sequences, and heterodimerization results in appreciable regulatory flexibility [33]. Among these bZIP transcription factors, three members of group B (bZIP17, bZIP28, bZIP49) perform as important regulators of the evolutionally conserved ER stress response [34], the intrafamily dimerization of group B has been confirmed in yeast cells [35]. In particular, under adverse environmental conditions, including high salinity, bZIP17 is reported to relocate from ER to nucleus processing by through regulated intramembrane proteolysis [36]. Salt-responsive genes are reported to express in a bZIP17-dependent manner [36, 37]. In this study, we observed the nuclei localization and the contributions of AGB1 to induce the expression of bZIP17-mediated salinity-responsive genes. The spliced bZIP17 localization toward nuclei through SITE-1 PROTEASE (S1P) / SITE-2 PROTEASE (S2P)-mediated proteolysis was reduced without AGB1. The arrangement of AGB1 pools among different subcellular compartments to involve proper programs to respond to high salinity is crucial for young seedling viability. RESULTS. FUNCTIONAL COMPLEMENTATION OF SALINITY HYPERSENSITIVITY IN AGB1 MUTANT. In this study, the AGB1 transcript was significantly increased under high salt stress after 4 h, as described previously (Fig. S3A; [19]). The agb1-3 mutant is a null mutant of AGB1 (as agb1, Fig. S1A, S1B, S2A, S2B [38]). It shows hypersensitive responses, including poor germination, growth defects, and albino leaves when grown under salt stress (Fig. 1).

38904364,"Enterovirus 3A protein disrupts endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis through interaction with GBF1. Enteroviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses causing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to induce or modulate downstream signaling pathways known as the unfolded protein responses (UPR). However, viral and host factors involved in the UPR related to viral pathogenesis remain unclear. In the present study, we aimed to identify the major regulator of enterovirus-induced UPR and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. We showed that host Golgi-specific brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1), which supports enteroviruses replication, was a major regulator of the UPR caused by infection with enteroviruses. In addition, we found that severe UPR was induced by the expression of 3A proteins encoded in human pathogenic enteroviruses, such as enterovirus A71, coxsackievirus B3, poliovirus, and enterovirus D68. The N-terminal-conserved residues of 3A protein interact with the GBF1 and induce UPR through inhibition of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) activation via GBF1 sequestration. Remodeling and expansion of ER and accumulation of ER-resident proteins were observed in cells infected with enteroviruses. Finally, 3A induced apoptosis in cells infected with enteroviruses via activation of the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)/C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) pathway of UPR. Pharmaceutical inhibition of PERK suppressed the cell death caused by infection with enteroviruses, suggesting the UPR pathway is a therapeutic target for treating diseases caused by infection with enteroviruses.IMPORTANCEInfection caused by several plus-stranded RNA viruses leads to dysregulated ER homeostasis in the host cells. The mechanisms underlying the disruption and impairment of ER homeostasis and its significance in pathogenesis upon enteroviral infection remain unclear. Our findings suggested that the 3A protein encoded in human pathogenic enteroviruses disrupts ER homeostasis by interacting with GBF1, a major regulator of UPR. Enterovirus-mediated infections drive ER into pathogenic conditions, where ER-resident proteins are accumulated. Furthermore, in such scenarios, the PERK/CHOP signaling pathway induced by an unresolved imbalance of ER homeostasis essentially drives apoptosis. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the virus-induced disruption of ER homeostasis might be a potential target to mitigate the pathogenesis of enteroviruses.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6752,neg_MEDLINE,0.00705271,0
38905346,"Olfaction regulates peripheral mitophagy and mitochondrial function. INTRODUCTION. Coordinating stress responses across tissues is paramount for maintaining cellular homeostasis and longevity in response to environmental insults, and a robust body of literature has established the central nervous system as a master regulator of cellular stress responses across the whole organism. Activating the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPRER) (1), the heat shock response (2), and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRMT) (3, 4) in neurons results in cell nonautonomous induction of their respective stress response in peripheral tissues. This nonautonomous coordination promotes survival in aging and in conditions of cellular stress, leading to the hypothesis that the nervous system evolved the ability to prepare the organism to withstand noxious environmental conditions. More recently, work on the nonautonomous regulation of UPRMT has focused on the requirement of distinct neural circuits and signaling molecules, as well as a broader description of peripheral mitochondrial phenotypes under conditions of neuronal mitochondria dysfunction. For example, induction of mitochondrial stress in neurons by knockout of fzo-1/mitofusin drives peripheral UPRMT induction, enhances mitophagy, and increases pathogen resistance dependent on serotoninergic, tyraminergic, and neuropeptidergic signaling (5). Despite the insights into the signaling cascades and neuronal players required for peripheral induction of UPRMT by the central nervous system, the evolutionary context and sensory modalities that necessitate this coordination remain incompletely understood. The olfactory nervous system has been identified as a nonautonomous regulator of metabolic homeostasis and life span. In mice, olfactory exposure to food odors activates hypothalamic neurons, which signal to the liver to activate UPRER and to initiate lipid synthesis (6), while olfactory neuron ablation abates diet-induced obesity and increases mitochondrial respiration in fat tissue by noradrenergic afferent signaling (7). A connection between olfaction and metabolic regulation has also been established in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for olfactory circuits in regulating peripheral physiology. Specifically, loss of function in distinct olfactory neurons extends life span by down-regulating insulin signaling (8), and silencing a single olfactory neuron pair, AWC, regulates lipid metabolism and enhanced proteostasis through neuroendocrine control (9, 10). These studies indicate that the olfactory nervous system plays a role in assessing environmental nutritional status and signals to the periphery to prepare for food intake. All organisms must consume nutrients to survive; however, eating poses substantial cellular hazards. In eating, tissues not only are tasked with metabolizing nutrients but also must withstand and clear toxic metabolites, like mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (mtROS), and must defend against food-borne pathogens. Pathogenic infection is a formidable cellular stressor, and organisms, including the bacterivore C. elegans, induce various genetic programs to counteract pathogen-associated damage. During infection with the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, C. elegans activate the UPRMT transcription factor atfs-1 to resolve mitochondrial damage and to induce innate immune response genes (11). Loss of atfs-1 activity and diminished UPRMT induction results in sensitivity to P. aeruginosa infection (11). In their natural milieu, C. elegans are exposed to myriad commensal and pathogenic bacteria and must discern which are helpful or harmful, primarily through the detection of bacterial metabolites. Olfaction is the mode of detection of such volatile metabolites, indicating that olfactory neurons have privileged access to information about potential pathogenic threats in the environment. We hypothesize that olfactory neurons might be top-most coordinators of UPRMT induction and may serve as an early warning system to prepare the periphery for pathogenic infection. Recent work in C. elegans has shown that loss of certain sensory neurons, particularly the olfactory neuron AWC, contributes to P. aeruginosa resistance; however, whether olfactory regulation of UPRMT is responsible for this resistance has been left unexplored (12). Here, we find that ablation of the inhibitory olfactory neuron pair AWC is sufficient to drive peripheral activation of UPRMT, reduce mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) rates, and reduce mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These phenotypes are dependent on serotonergic signaling, suggesting that AWC-mediated olfactory circuitry regulates peripheral UPRMT and mtDNA content cell nonautonomously. Moreover, reduction in OXPHOS and mtDNA content downstream of AWC ablation fully depends on the mitophagy machinery pdr-1 (parkin homolog), and induction of UPRMT partially depends on pdr-1. These mitochondrial phenotypes are recapitulated by exposure to the bacterial metabolite 2,3-pentanedione (2,3-pent), an AWC-silencing odorant, suggesting that olfactory regulation of peripheral mitochondrial mass and function may occur in a naturalistic context. P. aeruginosa generates 2,3-pent, suggesting that AWC neurons are tuned to detect this pathogen (13). Finally, we find that AWC-mediated P. aeruginosa infection resistance is partially dependent on the UPRMT transcription factor atfs-1 and fully dependent on pdr-1, indicating that olfactory neurons can prepare the organism for pathogenic insult through regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. RESULTS. ABLATION OF OLFACTORY NEURON AWC INDUCES UPRMT, CONFERS ATFS-1–MEDIATED PATHOGEN RESISTANCE, REDUCES OXPHOS, AND DEPLETES MTDNA CONTENT.

38927630,"Knockout Mouse Studies Show That Mitochondrial CLPP Peptidase and CLPX Unfoldase Act in Matrix Condensates near IMM, as Fast Stress Response in Protein Assemblies for Transcript Processing, Translation, and Heme Production. 1. CLPP IS A KEY MODIFIER OF GROWTH AND LIFESPAN, BUT ITS SUBSTRATES REMAIN UNCLEAR. LONP1 is the principal proteolysis factor of the mitochondrial matrix, combining an AAA+ ATPase unfoldase domain with a serine peptidase domain within the same protein sequence. LONP1 homo-multimerizes in a ring or barrel shape to maximize its efficiency and plays a crucial role in the turnover of respiratory chain complexes and most other proteins in this compartment [1,2,3]. According to studies on bacteria, CLPXP is perceived as a similar but stress-responsive proteolysis machine, also in the mitochondrial matrix. However, CLPX as an AAA+ ATPase unfoldase component and CLPP as a serine peptidase component are separate proteins. To obtain proteolytic capacity, via assembly in a barrel-like conformation similar to LONP1, they can hetero-multimerize. Nonetheless, in proteolysis, they play a secondary role, becoming prominent only after cellular stress [4]. Both systems have been conserved from bacteria to humans, so each of them has to play very relevant roles in the mitochondrial matrix. Indeed, the loss of LONP1 in a homozygous state causes lethality already during early embryonic development [1]. In contrast, the loss of CLPP was observed to extend the lifespan in the eukaryotic fungus Podospora anserina, and CLPP is constitutively absent from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5,6]. This emphasizes a dramatic difference in the functional impact of these two systems, which is at odds with the idea that both act similarly in proteolytic degradation. Genetic analyses of human diseases recently showed mild LONP1 mutations to be responsible for CODAS syndrome, where craniofacial dysmorphia, cataracts, ptosis, a median nasal groove, delayed tooth eruption, delayed epiphyseal ossification, metaphyseal hip dysplasia, vertebral coronal clefts, short stature, psychomotor and developmental delay, and hearing loss are diagnostic hallmarks [7,8]. In contrast, CLPP mutations cause Perrault syndrome type 3 (PRLTS3) [9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. Perrault syndrome was clinically and genetically defined as the combination of early female infertility due to primary ovarian failure, with the subsequent onset of progressive sensorineural hearing impairment and autosomal recessive inheritance. Later, it was observed that not only deafness but also sensory neuropathy, ataxia, and brain white matter changes can appear as neurodegenerative features [16,17,18,19,20]. Judging by human genetics, the functions of LONP1 and CLPP therefore appear to target different pathways, and their dysfunctions have widely different consequences. Genetic causes of PRTLS are almost exclusively due to mtDNA/mtRNA or mitoribosome machinery errors [13,21]. The role of mtDNA in Perrault syndrome’s pathogenesis is substantiated by causal mutations in the mitochondrial DNA/RNA helicase TWNK/PEO1 and in the mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM [22,23]. The role of mtRNA processing is corroborated by causal mutations in the mitochondrial rRNA chaperone ERAL1 and the mitochondrial RNase P component PRORP [16,24,25]. The roles of mt-tRNA processing and mitoribosomal translation are evident from causal mutations in the mitochondrial tRNA–amino acid ligases HARS2 and LARS2, as well as the mitoribosome-associated factor RMND1 [13,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]. The detailed correlation of mutant mitochondrial factors with the consequent phenotypes (Figure 4 in [36]) indicates that primary infertility is mostly due to abnormal mtDNA or mt-tRNA processing, whereas hearing impairment is frequently due to abnormal mtRNA processing or mitoribosomal translation. Thus, CLPP appears to selectively modulate mitochondrial RNA processing and translation. Also in a complete phenotypic contrast, human CLPX mutations were observed to cause erythropoietic protoporphyria 2 (leading to acute skin photosensitivity, mild microcytic anemia, and rarely, severe liver disease) [37,38]. The credibility of these findings is enhanced by observations from yeast to humans that CLPX, independently from CLPP, activates heme biosynthesis [5,37,39]. The recent generation of several independent Clpp-knockout (KO) mouse lines, by means of Gene-Trap random insertion [40] and targeted conditional technology [41], provided authentic genetic animal models of PRLTS3 with the characteristic phenotypes and allowed for the elucidation of the underlying molecular and functional deficits. Independently and in perfect agreement, the biochemical analyses of each research team showed that CLPP homo-multimer rings exist normally without CLPX association in blue-native electrophoresis, where endogenous protein complexes are resolved according to their interactive stability and molecular weight (Figure 2 in [42], Supplementary Figure EV3B in [43]). Thus, in unstressed mammalian cells, CLPP rings do not associate with the energy-providing AAA+ ATPase CLPX and cannot perform the degradation of protein substrates, which would require ATP hydrolysis [4]. Therefore, CLPP functions would normally be limited to act as a peptidase like chymotrypsin [44], trimming proteins or multi-protein assemblies rather than completely eliminating them. This concept is in agreement with a recent review where the role of CLPX and CLPP was seen in the fine-tuning of mitochondrial matrix multi-protein assemblies rather than in proteolysis [44]. CLPX as a monomer or homo-multimer ring would then employ its energy from ATP hydrolysis to unfold proteins or protein complexes without subsequent destruction. Of course, CLPX and CLPP may join forces under conditions of cell stress, e.g., when mitoribosomal translation is stalled and a misfolded nascent polypeptide has to be degraded, or after cell damage to disaggregate and cleave the toxic oligomers of ribonucleoproteins.

INTRODUCTION. Since December 2019, the COVID‐19 has been ravaging the world, posing a serious threat to the lives of people worldwide. With the implementation of effective prevention and treatment measures by the Chinese government, the epidemic situation in China has improved and this respiratory infectious disease has been brought under control. Therefore, more and more people realize the importance of infectious disease prevention behavior. Although a large body of research has confirmed that infectious disease prevention behavior can significantly improve the quality of life of individuals [1], the mechanisms of infectious disease prevention behavior affecting the quality of life are not clear. We provide possible mechanisms by which infectious disease prevention behaviors influence the quality of life, such as self‐efficacy and family structure. 1.1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE PREVENTION BEHAVIOR, SELF‐EFFICACY, AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE. Health Self‐Empowerment Theory (HSET) emphasizes the importance of individual cognitive‐behavioral variables (e.g., health motivation, health self‐efficacy, positive coping) in promoting people's health [2]. As a specific type of positive coping, infectious disease prevention behavior has been found to play a significant role in health promotion [3]. Infectious disease prevention behavior refers to a range of health prevention behaviors taken by individuals to prevent and treat infectious diseases, such as choosing to wear a mask outside during the outbreak to prevent respiratory diseases. Some researchers have found that infectious disease prevention behavior is very important for improving the quality of life of patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases [4] and is an important measure in ensuring healthy aging and maintaining the quality of life [5]. Infectious disease prevention behavior not only affects the individual's quality of life but also affects the individual's sense of self‐efficacy [6]. Self‐efficacy was first proposed by Bandura. It refers to people's confidence in whether they can use their own skills to complete a certain work behavior, and its formation is influenced by the experience of success or failure in the behaviors [7]. Infectious disease prevention behavior as a successful behavior to prevent infection is bound to increase the individual's sense of self‐efficacy. In studies of specific infectious diseases, a strong correlation has been found between infectious disease prevention behavior (e.g., vaccination) and an individual's sense of self‐efficacy [8], such that those who choose to wear a mask during the outbreak clearly know that the outcome of their behavior for themselves is a reduced probability of illness, further enhancing self‐efficacy. As a positive developmental indicator, self‐efficacy has a positive effect on the quality of life [3] and has been found to be a strong predictor of the individual's quality of life [9]. In studies on patients with epilepsy [10] and severe myasthenia gravis [11], the predictive effect of self‐efficacy on patients' quality of life has been confirmed. 1.2. THE REGULATORY ROLE OF FAMILY STRUCTURE. According to Ecological Systems Theory, a developing individual is subject to four environmental systems—micro, intermediate, outer, and macro—which influence many aspects of individual development [12]. As the core part of the microsystem, the family has a direct effect on individual development and outcomes. The family structure in which people usually live is a structural determinant of health [13], and each family can have different family structures, such as the nuclear family (family consisting of parents and unmarried children), stem family (family consisting of parents and a married pair of children), conjugal family (family consisting of parents only), collective family (family consisting of several unrelated people living together temporarily), and single‐parent family (family consisting of divorced or widowed persons with children), and so forth. In a family study of children with chronic epilepsy, family structure type was found to be prominently associated with self‐efficacy [14]. Compared with the self‐efficacy of members with an incomplete family structure, the self‐efficacy of members with an intact family structure was better [15]. Previous studies have found that infectious disease prevention behavior can significantly enhance individuals' self‐efficacy [16], and different family structures can also affect individuals' self‐efficacy, which means that there may be differences in the impact of infectious disease prevention behavior on individuals' self‐efficacy in families that may vary across family structures. In addition, it has been established that family structure is a structural driver of family members' health [17]. Martins et al.'s [18] study showed that older people living with their children had poorer quality of life outcomes, while Liu et al. [19] found that compared to those with children, the quality of life of the elderly without children is significantly reduced. We found that older people living with their children had access to family social support and were predictive of older people's health status [20]. This illustrates the inconsistency in findings obtained so far in research on the relationship between core families, conjugal family structure, and the quality of life of family members. Some studies have suggested that family relationship is also a factor affecting the quality of life of older people [21]; therefore, the marital status of children is bound to affect the quality of life of parents.

RNA bacteriophage MS2-derived virus-like particles (VLPs) have been widely used in biomedical research as model systems to study virus assembly, structure-function relationships, vaccine development, and drug delivery. Considering the diverse utility of these VLPs, a systemic engineering approach has been utilized to generate smaller particles with optimal serum stability and tissue penetrance. Additionally, it is crucial to demonstrate the overall stability of these mini MS2 VLPs, ensuring cargo protection until they reach their target cell/organ. However, no detailed analysis of the thermal stability and heat-induced disassembly of MS2 VLPs has yet been attempted. In this work, we investigated the thermal stability of both wild-type (WT) MS2 VLP and its ""mini"" variant containing S37P mutation (mini MS2 VLP). The mini MS2 VLP exhibits a higher capsid melting temperature (Tm) when compared to its WT MS2 VLP counterpart, possibly attributed to its smaller interdimer angle. Our study presents that the thermal unfolding of MS2 VLPs follows a sequential process involving particle destabilization, nucleic acid exposure/melting, and disassembly of VLP.

39002671,"Structural basis of binding the unique N-terminal domain of microtubule-associated protein 2c to proteins regulating kinases of signaling pathways. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) regulate stability and dynamics of microtubules. MAP2 and Tau are MAPs expressed in brain neurons in several splicing variants. MAP2 and Tau differ in their cellular localization. MAP2 is found mainly in cell body and dendrites (1), whereas Tau is localized preferentially in axons (2). MAP2c is the shortest variant of MAP2, consisting of 467 amino acids (rat MAP2c). It is expressed prenatally and in brain regions exhibiting postnatal plasticity (3, 4). MAP2c consists of two domains. The N-terminal domain of MAP2c has a unique sequence, distinguishing MAP2c from Tau. The C-terminal domain has a high sequence homology with Tau isoforms (5). The MAP2c domains can be further divided to several regions, including N-terminal region, variable central region, proline-rich regions, microtubule-binding repeats (MTBRs), and C-terminal region (6). The domain organization of MAP2c is depicted in Figure 1. The microtubule-regulating function of MAP2 and Tau is associated with MTBRs. In spite of the high overall sequence homology of MTBRs, small variations in sequences result in very different pathological roles of MAP2 and Tau (7). Certain regions of Tau MTBRs tend to aggregate and form paired helical filaments and neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of patients suffering from the Alzheimer disease (8). MTBRs in MAP2 do not form such aggregates (7). Therefore, MAP2 are not involved in neurodegenerative diseases like Tau. Yet, MAP2 malfunction may result in pathological states such as depression (9) or schizophrenia (10, 11). As mentioned above, the major differences between MAP2 and Tau can be found in the N-terminal domain. In this study, we explore interactions of the first 159 residues of MAP2c (cf Fig. 1). Deletion of this region results in the disruption of hippocampal neuron architecture and deficits in contextual memory in mice (12). The N-terminal region interacts with binding partners involved in functions other than direct microtubule regulation. In particular, interactions with the type II regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA and with growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) attracted great attention. PKA and Grb2 control the phosphorylation of multiple proteins downstream the signaling pathways they are involved in. The functions of PKA and Grb2 are regulated by binding various proteins, including MAP2. PKA is a ubiquitous kinase playing important roles in brain neurons (13). In its inactive form, PKA is present as a tetrameric holoenzyme consisting of two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits (14). The specificity of PKA signaling is achieved by expressing R subunits as nonredundant isoforms of two types (RI and RII), each having two subtypes (RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ). The enzyme is localized in the cell by interactions of the R subunits with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) tethered to the plasma membrane, cytoskeleton, or various organelles (15). Most AKAPs bind RII subunits preferentially (16), but dual-specific (17, 18) and RI-specific (19, 20, 21, 22) AKAPs have been also described. Binding of cAMP to the R subunits activates PKA by releasing the C subunits that phosphorylate their target proteins in the cellular compartment determined by the AKAP anchoring. All AKAPs contain a relatively long amphipathic α-helix that tightly binds the dimerization/docking domains of the R subunits (23). Solution and crystal structures of the dimerization/docking domains with the AKAP helices confirmed that the interactions are primarily hydrophobic (23, 24, 25, 26), while electrostatic interactions seem to define the specificity (23). Based on the available structures and on sequence alignment of AKAPs, a model explaining the AKAP specificity and predicting the register of interacting AKAP residues was proposed (23). MAP2 isoforms, anchoring PKA to microtubules, were the first AKAPs identified (27), binding preferentially the RIIα subunit of PKA (RIIα-PKA) (28, 29). Experiments with successively smaller MAP2 fragment identified that MAP2 residues Asp83–Glu113 are sufficient for the binding (30). The MAP2:RII interaction plays a major role in controlling the PKA activity in the dendrites of hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons (13, 31). It was reported that MAP2 is the dominant AKAP in pyramidal dendrites, restricting more than 97% of the RII subunits to dendritic shafts (13). Anchoring of PKA by MAP2 is an important mechanism of the regulation of postsynaptic functions (13) and is involved in the antidepressant response (32). PKA anchoring by MAP2 also influences the function of MAP2 itself. MAP2 isoforms act both as upstream regulators and downstream targets of cAMP-dependent pathways. Activity of PKA modulates microtubule bundling by MAP2 (33). Earlier, we have studied MAP2c as a substrate of PKA, in comparison with its homolog Tau. PKA phosphorylates MAP2c outside MTBRs. PKA phosphorylation of MAP2c thus does not directly interfere with microtubule binding, in contrast to the inhibiting effect of PKA phosphorylation on Tau–microtubule interactions (34). However, PKA phosphorylation reduces MAP2c interactions with microtubules indirectly, as it enhances the binding of MAP2c to the regulatory protein 14-3-3, which competes with the MAP2c–microtubule interactions (34). Grb2 was first described as a linker coupling growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to the rat sarcoma virus (Ras) signaling pathways (35). Grb2 structure (36) consists of two Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains, recognizing PXXP motifs, and of one Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain, binding phosphorylated tyrosine. The Grb2 SH2 domain (Grb2-SH2) interacts with phosphorylated RTKs, and the SH3 domains bind the mammalian homologs of Drosophila Son of sevenless (SOS) gene products. The interaction of Grb2 with phosphorylated RTKs triggers the guanine nucleotide exchanging activity of SOS. The activated SOS then releases GDP from Ras, which can bind GTP a",PMC,pos,1,pos,6797,pos_PMC,0.99771726,1
39023093,"The U1-70K and SRSF1 interaction is modulated by phosphorylation during the early stages of spliceosome assembly. 1. INTRODUCTION. Most eukaryotic genes contain intervening sequences of exons and introns (Pan et al., 2008). To generate functional mRNA, introns need to be removed, and exons are joined together through a process known as pre‐mRNA splicing. The pre‐mRNA splicing occurs in the spliceosome, a dynamic RNA–protein complex that contains five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6), and hundreds of splicing factors (Staley & Guthrie, 1998; Will & Luhrmann, 1997). The spliceosome assembly commences with the recruitment of U1 and U2 complexes to the 5′ and 3′ splicing sites, respectively (Chabot & Steitz, 1987; Moore et al., 1993; Zillmann et al., 1987). These assembly steps rely on base pairing between U1/U2 RNA and conserved motifs around the splicing sites, such as the 5′ GU motif, and the 3′ AG motif proceeded by a pyrimidine tract (Moore et al., 1993). However, base pairing is insufficient for splicing of most pre‐mRNA, especially these undergoing alternative splicing. In addition to RNA base paring, alternatively spliced pre‐mRNA transcripts also possess regulatory RNA elements called splicing enhancers and silencers, located in both intronic and exonic regions. Splicing enhancers and silencers are recognized by splicing factors, to promote or reduce the usage of neighboring splicing sites, respectively (Anko, 2014; Long & Caceres, 2009; Manley & Krainer, 2010; Siebel et al., 1992; Siebel & Rio, 1990; Zhou & Fu, 2013). Ser‐Arg rich splicing factors (SR), which are the predominant splicing factors, recognize splicing enhancers and play a critical role in alternative splicing, a process regulating over 95% of the human protein genome (Anko, 2014; Long & Caceres, 2009; Manley & Krainer, 2010; Pan et al., 2008; Zhou & Fu, 2013). SR proteins contain one to two RNA‐recognition motifs (RRM) and a featured arginine/serine region (RS). SR RRM domains specifically recognize splicing enhancers. The RS domains are subject to varying phosphorylation by SR protein kinases (SRPK) and Cyclin‐dependent like kinases (Clk), facilitating protein–protein interactions (Colwill, Feng, et al., 1996; Colwill, Pawson, et al., 1996; Duncan et al., 1998; Gui, Lane, et al., 1994; Gui, Tronchere, et al., 1994; Hertel & Graveley, 2005; Wu & Maniatis, 1993). The binding of SR proteins to enhancers typically promotes inclusion of the corresponding exons (Cavaloc et al., 1999; Liu et al., 1998, 2000; Schaal & Maniatis, 1999; Tacke & Manley, 1995), although splicing inhibition is observed when SR proteins bind to introns for some RNA transcripts (Dembowski et al., 2012; Erkelenz et al., 2013). SR proteins facilitate exon inclusion by interacting with the U1 component protein, U1‐70K (also known as snRNP70) in an RNA‐independent way (Kohtz et al., 1994). U1‐70K consists of RRM and two basic‐acid dipeptide regions (BAD1 and BAD2) (Figure 1a). The U1‐70K RRM tightly binds to a stem‐loop region of U1 RNA and becomes a component protein of U1 snRNP (Kondo et al., 2015). The interaction between SR proteins and U1‐70K has attracted considerable efforts to understand its binding mechanism. However, it remains elusive due to the challenges in obtaining soluble full‐length SR proteins and U1‐70K, the dynamic nature of the interaction, and complex phosphorylation background of these proteins. Controversy persists regarding which protein domains are essential for the SR/U1‐70K interaction. Pull‐down and yeast two‐hybrid studies have suggested that phosphorylated SRSF1 RS is crucial for its interaction with U1‐70K and other proteins (Hertel & Graveley, 2005; Wu & Maniatis, 1993). Nevertheless, another study proposed that the RRM domains of SRSF1 and U1‐70K play a key role, while the SRSF1 RS is accessory (Cho et al., 2011). Still different from the aforementioned studies, a yeast‐two hybrid study shows that the BAD1 domain of U1‐70K is essential and sufficient for SRSF1 interaction (Cao & Garcia‐Blanco, 1998). Most of these studies relied on crude cell extracts or indirect methods. Therefore, direct experimental evidence remains needed to elucidate the interaction between SR proteins and U1‐70K (Zhou & Fu, 2013). Furthermore, the interaction between SR proteins and U1‐70K is dynamic, a requirement for its biological function. After formation of B‐complex, the U1 complex dissembles from the spliceosome before activation of splicing (Moore et al., 1993). Due to the transient nature of the interaction, the complex between SR proteins and U1‐70K has never been observed in cryo‐EM studies. Moreover, both SR proteins and U1‐70K are heavily phosphorylated. SR proteins exist in un‐, hypo‐, and hyper‐phosphorylated states. Previous studies have shown that hyper‐phosphorylation of SR proteins is essential for U1‐70K interaction (Kohtz et al., 1994). U1‐70K is also a heavily phosphorylated protein (Woppmann et al., 1990). U1‐70K in the cell has at least 13 different species according to the isoelectric points (Woppmann et al., 1990). When the dephosphorylation of U1‐70K is abolished by thio‐phosphorylation, RNA splicing was inhibited (Tazi et al., 1993). It is still unknown how phosphorylation of U1‐70K regulates its functions. In this study, we have successfully addressed the long‐standing challenge of U1‐70K insolubility and low expression. Building on our recent success in solubilizing full‐length SRSF1, we have a unique opportunity to unravel the mechanism underlying the U1‐70K and SRSF1 interaction. Employing fluorescence polarization (FP) assays, we find that SRSF1 RRM1 interacts with U1‐70K RRM, and phosphorylated SRSF1 RS interacts with U1‐70K BAD1, with U1‐70K BAD2 being dispensable for SRSF1 interaction. The spectrum of hypo‐ to hyper‐phosphorylation of SRSF1 RS enhances its binding to U1‐70K progressively. These findings are further supported by our in vitro splicing assays, which show that exogenous BAD1 efficiently inhibits splicing, RRM has a mild effect, and BAD2 has no such inhibitory effect.

The ability to control when the hydrogel degrades can provide beneficial properties such as controlled degradation in the environment or the stimulated release of drugs or cells. Self-immolative polymers are a class of degradable polymers that undergo complete end-to-end depolymerization upon the application of a stimulus. They have been explored for hydrogel development, but the ability to prepare and selectively degrade self-immolative hydrogels under neutral aqueous conditions has so far been limited. We describe here the preparation of water-soluble polyglyoxylamides with cross-linkable pendent azides and their cross-linking to form hydrogels with 4-arm poly(ethylene glycol)s having unstrained and strained alkynes using copper-assisted and strain-promoted azide-alkyne click chemistry respectively. The influence of pendent azide density and solution polymer content on the resulting hydrogels was evaluated. A polyglyoxylamide with a 70 : 30 ratio of pendent hydroxyl:azide successfully provided hydrogels with compressive moduli ranging from 1.3-6.3 kPa under copper-free conditions at 10-20 % (w/w) of polymer in phosphate-buffered saline. Selective depolymerization and degradation of the hydrogels upon irradiation with light was demonstrated, resulting in reductions in the compressive moduli and the release of depolymerization products that were detected by NMR spectroscopy.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,6808,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.003524341,0
39034275,"Abnormal Temporal Window of Integration in Auditory Sensory Memory in Schizophrenia. Mismatch negativity (MMN) is automatically elicited by incoming sound deviation compared to the neural representation of preceding homogenous sounds stored in the brain's auditory sensory memory. This study aimed to assess time-functional deviation sensitivity in auditory sensory memory associated with a temporal window of integration (TWI) of 160-170 msec in patients with schizophrenia. To this end, we measured the magnetic counterpart of the MMN (MMNm) in 20 patients with schizophrenia on medication and 20 healthy age-matched adults as a control group responding to an omitted tone segment incorporated into a complex sound of 176 ms duration corresponding to the TWI duration. Overall, the magnitude of the MMNm was smaller in the patients with schizophrenia than in the healthy control group. The peak latency of the MMNm was prolonged in the latter omitted segments for both groups, but to a greater extent in patients with schizophrenia. These results indicate that deviation detection is impaired in the later part of the TWI, corresponding to the duration of auditory sensory memory in patients with schizophrenia. Thus, the specific impairment of MMN in response to duration deviants (duration MMN), as previously reported, might result from a damaged mechanism in the later part of the TWI of sensory memory, suggesting that a decline in sensory memory causes distorted perception or disturbances in cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,6810,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0022474632,0

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate changes in heart rate variability (HRV) and QT dispersion (QTd) in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer at different TSH suppression levels. METHODS The study included 125 DTC patients, who had been on TSH suppression treatment (TSHST) for at least 1 year. The patients were categorized into three groups: patients with TSH < 0.1 mIU/L (n:30), those with TSH 0.1 to 0.5 mIU/L (n:56), and those with TSH 0.5 to 2 mIU/L (n:39). The first two groups were classified as suppression groups, and the last as replacement (control) group. All patients underwent 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recording and 24-hour rhythm holter echocardiography analysis. RESULTS The HRV results derived from a 24-hour rhythm holter did not exhibit any significant difference (p < 0.05). In dispersion evaluations, the QTd was significantly longer in the suppression groups (groups 1 and 2), than in the replacement group (group 3) (p < 0.001 and p:0.002, respectively). The same was found for corrected QT dispersion (QTcd) (p < 0.001 and p: 0.008, respectively). In multivariate linear regression analysis, TSH was found to affect QTd (β = -0.299; p = 0.002) and QTcd (β = -0.300; p = 0.002) values independently. CONCLUSION In this study, it was shown that in patients with DTC receiving TSHST, QT dispersion prolonged as the TSH suppression level increased. Especially in high-risk DTC patients, evaluation of QTd may be useful in terms of evaluating cardiovascular risk and regulating TSHST level.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,6820,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0022606407,0
39084166,"IRE1 is implicated in protein synthesis regulation under ER stress conditions in plants. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a crucial cellular mechanism for maintaining protein folding homeostasis during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In this study, the role of IRE1, a key component of the UPR, was investigated in protein translation regulation under ER stress conditions in Arabidopsis. We discovered that the loss of IRE1A and IRE1B leads to diminished protein translation, indicating a significant role for IRE1 in this process. However, this regulation was not solely dependent on the interaction with bZIP60, a key transcription factor in the UPR. Interestingly, while chemical chaperones TUDCA and PBA effectively alleviated the translation inhibition observed in ire1a ire1b mutants, this effect was more pronounced than the mitigation observed from suppressing GCN2 expression or introducing a non-phosphorylatable eIF2α variant. Additionally, the kinase and ribonuclease activities of IRE1B were demonstrated to be crucial for plant adaptation and protein synthesis regulation under ER stress conditions.

Aggregation of protein-based therapeutics can occur during development, production, or storage and can lead to loss of efficacy and potential toxicity. Native mass spectrometry of a covalently linked pentameric monoclonal antibody complex with a mass of ∼800 kDa reveals several distinct conformations, smaller complexes, and abundant higher-order aggregates of the pentameric species. Charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) reveals individual oligomers up to the pentamer mAb trimer (15 individual mAb molecules; ∼2.4 MDa) whereas intermediate aggregates composed of 6-9 mAb molecules and aggregates larger than the pentameric dimer (1.6 MDa) were not detected/resolved by standard mass spectrometry, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), capillary electrophoresis (CE-SDS), or by mass photometry. Conventional quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF MS), mass photometry, SEC, and CE-SDS did not resolve partially or more fully unfolded conformations of each oligomer that were readily identified using CDMS by their significantly higher extents of charging. Trends in the charge-state distributions of individual oligomers provides detailed insight into how the structures of compact and elongated mAb aggregates change as a function of aggregate size. These results demonstrate the advantages of CDMS for obtaining accurate masses and information about the conformations of large antibody aggregates despite extensive overlapping m/z values.

39132528,"Lithotripsy-Assisted Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement for Severe Mitral Annular and Valve Calcification. INTRODUCTION. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) has rapidly evolved. Although transapical TMVR devices have shown promise, procedure-related morbidity remains a concern. Transseptal TMVR appears feasible as reflected by reported off-label use of the Edwards SAPIEN balloon-expandable valve (BEV) in the mitral position. Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is common in patients with mitral regurgitation (MR), ranging from 11.7% to 42% in elderly patients. Severe MAC and mitral valve leaflet calcification (MVC) pose challenges for surgical mitral valve repair/replacement. Decalcifications with an ultrasound surgical aspirator and annular reconstruction are technically challenging. Operative risk is significantly increased in patients with severe MAC.,. In patients with high surgical risk, hybrid transatrial or transeptal deployment of the SAPIEN BEV in severe MAC has been reported. Balloon predilation and postdilation of the native valve was performed in 26.7% and 53%, respectively, of patients undergoing transseptal TMVR, and overall device success was 53.3%. Transseptal TMVR with self-expanding valves may be challenging in patients with severe MAC and MVC due to valve frame constraint and subsequent pin-wheeling of the valve leaflets with residual MR; however, transseptal BEV may provide better frame expansion at the risk of catastrophic annular disruption. Lithotripsy-assisted balloon mitral valvuloplasty has been reported,; however, balloon dilation of severe MAC and MVC carries a risk of systemic embolism. We describe the first human use of lithotripsy-assisted transeptal TMVR with the Intrepid valve (Medtronic) using cerebral embolic protection of all the great vessels in a patient with symptomatic severe mitral stenosis and MR due to severe MAC/MVC. METHODS. CASE DESCRIPTION. An 83-year-old man with rheumatic mitral and aortic valve disease, prior transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis (2018), and atrial fibrillation presented with worsening, medically refractory dyspnea and was noted to have severe mitral stenosis/MR. BASELINE IMAGING. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular systolic function, a normal bioprosthetic aortic valve function (mean gradient, 11 mm Hg), and severe MAC/MVC. The mean mitral gradient was 10 mm Hg, the mitral valve area by continuity was 0.9 cm2, and MR was grade 3. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed severely calcified leaflets, thickened chordae, and severe MAC (Figure 1). Mitral valve area was 1.5 cm2, and grade 3+ MR (Carpentier type IIIA) with multiple jets was observed. Cardiac catheterization revealed right atrial pressure of 13 mm Hg, pulmonary systolic pressure of 50 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 30 mm Hg, cardiac index of 2.1, and minimal coronary disease. Cardiac computed tomography angiography analysis in the APOLLO (Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement with the Medtronic Intrepid TMVR System in Patients With Severe Symptomatic Mitral Regurgitation) trial core laboratories revealed a MAC score of 10, a calcium volume score of 7756 cm3, and dense MAC/MVC (Figure 1). The equipment was sized to a 48-mm Intrepid valve with oversizing of 20% in perimeter, 9% in commissural diameter, and 54% in anteroposterior (AP) diameter for the patient. The neo-left ventricular outflow tract at end-systole was 300 mm2. The femoral vein, inferior vena cava, and left atrium were adequately sized to accommodate valve deployment. PROCEDURE DETAILS. Following signed informed consent for the APOLLO trial, the patient was approved for the MAC arm of the trial, and the procedure was performed in a hybrid operating room under general anesthesia with TEE guidance. To prevent systemic embolization, SENTINEL (Boston Scientific) cerebral embolic protection of the right innominate and left common carotid arteries was performed. Left vertebral artery protection was provided during valvuloplasty and TMVR by inflating a 10 × 40–mm Admiral balloon (Medtronic) in the ostium of the left subclavian artery (Figure 2). Right femoral vein access was obtained by surgical cut-down, and a 22F DrySeal Sheath (Gore) was inserted through which a transseptal Baylis TorFlex sheath (Boston Scientific) was advanced. A transseptal puncture was performed 4.5 cm above the mitral valve plane, a Safari wire (Boston Scientific Corporation) was advanced into the left atrium, and the intraatrial septum was dilated with a 14 × 40–mm Admiral balloon. A NAGARE tip-deflecting sheath (Terumo) was then advanced into the left atrium, and a pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricle (LV). The Safari wire was placed into the LV, and a 14F Mullins sheath (Cook) was advanced through which two 0.014-inch Grand Slam wires (Asahi) were placed into the LV. Two 8 × 60–mm Shockwave M5+ balloons were advanced across the mitral valve annulus with the middle emitters aligned with the annular plane, and lithotripsy was performed after inflating both balloons to 4 atm by delivering 4 rounds of 30 pulses each (total 120 pulses) with brief balloon deflation between pulse rounds (Central Illustration). The Safari wire was reinserted into the LV, and a 26-mm True balloon (Becton Dickinson) was placed across the mitral valve and inflated during rapid ventricular pacing until complete balloon expansion was achieved. The balloon, Mullins sheath, and Safari wire were removed and exchanged for a Lunderquist wire (Cook Medical), which was placed into the left upper pulmonary vein. Over this wire, the 37F TMVR sheath (Medtronic) was placed through which a 48-mm Intrepid valve was advanced into the LV. The valve was deployed using TEE guidance during rapid pacing (Figure 3). Postdeployment, moderate central MR and a valve gradient of 4 mm Hg were observed. Moderate valve frame deformation was noted in the AP dimension (15.8 mm), with complete expansion in the lateral dimension by TEE and fluoroscopy (Figures 4 and 5).

39147514,"Enhancement of hydrogen bonds between proteins and polyphenols through magnetic field treatment: Structure, interfacial properties, and emulsifying properties. In food systems, proteins and polyphenols typically coexist in a non-covalent manner. However, the inherent rigid structure of proteins may hinder the binding sites of polyphenols, thereby limiting the strength of their interaction. In the study, magnetic field (MF) treatment was used to enhance non-covalent interactions between coconut globulin (CG) and tannic acid (TA) to improve protein flexibility, enhancing their functional properties without causing oxidation of polyphenols. Based on protein structure results, the interaction between CG and TA caused protein structure to unfold, exposing hydrophobic groups. Treatment with a MF, particularly at 3 mT, further promoted protein unfolding, as evidenced by a decrease in α-helix structure and an increase in coil random. These structural transformations led to the exposure of the internal binding site bound to TA and strengthening the CG-TA interaction (polyphenol binding degree increased from 62.3 to 68.2%). The characterization of molecular forces indicated that MF treatment strengthened hydrogen bonding-dominated non-covalent interactions between CG and TA, leading to improved molecular flexibility of the protein. Specifically, at a MF treatment at 3 mT, CG-TA colloidal particles with small size and high surface hydrophobicity exhibited optimal interfacial activity and wettability (as evidenced by a three-phase contact angle of 89.0°). Consequently, CG-TA-stabilized high internal phase Pickering emulsions (HIPPEs) with uniform droplets and dense gel networks at 3 mT. Furthermore, the utilization of HIPPEs in 3D printing resulted in consistent geometric shapes, uniform surface textures, and distinct printed layers, demonstrating superior printing stability. As a result, MF treatment at 3 mT was identified as the most favorable.

The effect of anions on the positive electrospray ionization (ESI) of proteins in different strong acids with varying pH values from 3 to 1 is studied using high-pressure ESI. Reducing the pH from ∼2 to 1 caused a drastic shift in charge state from a high-charge-state distribution (HCSD) to a narrow low-charge-state distribution (LCSD). The shift in charge state was consistent with the circular dichroism result that showed a conformational change due to the ""acid-induced folding"" of proteins from an unfolding state to a compact molten globule state. Acids of different anions produced noticeable differences in the average charge for HCSD and LCSD. For HCSD, the average charge was lower than the value typically observed using formic and acetic acids. As for LCSD, the average charge was lower than the ""native"" charge. The high abundance of acid anion that induces the protein compaction was believed to play a role in charge reduction. The effectiveness of anions to ""refold"" a highly unfolded protein to a compact state and the propensity to reduce the charge of HCSD for proteins appeared to follow the selectivity series of anions towards the stationary phase in ion chromatography. However, the propensity of anions to reduce the charge for LCSD follows quite an opposite trend. The presence of ammonium salt in the acidic solution was found to increase the charge of LCSD.

The improvement of enzyme thermostability often accompanies the decreased activity due to the loss of the key regions' flexibility. As a representative structure, unlocking the potential of loop dynamics will not only provide new ideas for stabilization strategies, but also help to deepen the understanding of the relationship between enzyme structural dynamics and function. In this study, a creative ""hook loop dynamics engineering"" (HLoD) strategy was successfully proposed for simultaneously improving the thermostability and maintaining activity of the model enzyme, Candida Antarctica lipase B. A small and smart mutant library involving five key residues located at the ""hook loop"" was meticulously identified and systematically investigated and thus yielded a five-point multiple mutant M1 (L147S/T244P/S250P/T256D/N292D), demonstrating a remarkable 7.0-fold increase in thermostability at 60 °C compared to the wild-type (WT). Furthermore, the activity of M1 remained comparable to that of WT, effectively transcending the barrier of activity-stability trade-off. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the precise regulation of hook loop dynamics via intermolecular interactions, such as salt bridges and hydrogen bonding, curbed the excessive flexibility of the pivotal regions α5 and α10 at high temperatures, thus driving the substantial enhancement of the thermostability of M1.

39195787,"Chloroquine Downregulation of Intestinal Autophagy Changed Intestinal Microbial Community Compositions and Metabolite Profiles in Piglets. 1. INTRODUCTION. Weaned piglets represent a crucial segment of the pig production industry, but they are particularly vulnerable to stress during the weaning process. This stress can adversely affect their growth performance, ultimately leading to reduced economic benefits for pig farms. Our previous studies have indicated that when weaned piglets are given a specific dose of chloroquine (CQ) to inhibit autophagy, this improves their production performance and relieves weaning pressure, while piglets fed a specific dose of rapamycin (RAPA) in the diet exhibited activated autophagy and had a lower final body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) than the control treatment [1]. RAPA is a specific inhibitor of mammalian rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway targets, which improves autophagy by inducing microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) flux in vivo and in vitro [2]. CQ, a lysosomal inhibitor, has been shown to reverse autophagy by accumulating in lysosomes and interfering with the vacuolar H+ATPase [3]. Moreover, the inhibition of autophagy has been shown to alleviate the host’s inflammatory response and augment the activity of antioxidant enzymes in serum, thereby resolving the occurrence of oxidative stress in the host, in which gut function plays a well-established role [1]. Autophagy serves a protective role in cells by degrading and recycling proteins and organelles to maintain intracellular homeostasis. However, when autophagy’s mechanisms are disrupted or the autophagic flux is exceeded, this can lead to cell death [4]. The intestinal microbiota influences host autophagy through a variety of pathways and complex regulatory networks governing the autophagy mechanisms. In turn, autophagy and autophagy-related proteins can shape the gut microbiota [5]. There were increased levels of the autophagosome marker LC3-II in GF mice compared to SPF mice colonocytes, but the microbial metabolite butyrate inhibited the level of autophagy in the colons of GF mice [6]. Interestingly, the expression of some autophagy-related proteins (FoxO1, FoxO3, GABARAP and ATG7) and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio were increased in newborn piglets receiving FMT [7]. Changes in the gut microbiota composition were observed in mice conditionally deficient for autophagy (Atg5−/−, Atg7−/− and ATG16L1 T300A knock-in) in the gut [8,9,10]. Many human diseases are linked to an imbalance in microbial communities [11]. Early weaning reduced the growth performance, damaged jejunal morphology, disrupted immune profiles and oxidative balance and caused oxidative injury in piglets [12,13]. The intestinal microbes of piglets are in a critical period of construction when they are weaned [14]. Preliminary experimental results have demonstrated that improving the composition of the gut microbiome can improve anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capabilities, thereby alleviating weaning stress and increasing piglet production performance [15,16,17]. Therefore, exploring the relationship between intestinal autophagy and the gut microbiota in piglets during the weaning period is particularly valuable. Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the effects of the autophagy level on the gut microbiota and its metabolites in weaned piglet with the aim of analyzing the mechanism of autophagy affecting the production performance of weaned piglets from the microbiota perspective. 2. METHODS AND MATERIALS. The RAPA and CQ components (purity ≥ 98%) were provided by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). 2.1. ANIMAL TREATMENT AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Eighteen 24-day-old Large White × Landrace weaned piglets (barrow, average initial body weight (BW) of 7.03 ± 0.57 kg) were divided into the following three treatments: CON (equal volume normal saline solution), RAPA (1 mg/kg BW) and CQ (10 mg/kg BW). There were 6 replicates per treatment and 1 pig per replicate. Piglets were given 7 mL of normal saline, RAPA or CQ orally once a day at 27 days of age. On the 7th day of the test (33 days of age), the total amount of solution was adjusted according to the average weight of each treatment, with the specific operation and feeding management informed by the preliminary experiment [1]. The basal diet was formulated according to the nutritional needs of weaned piglets (NRC, 2012) [18], as proposed in previous studies [19]. The trial period was 17 days; see Figure S1 for details. 2.2. SAMPLE COLLECTION. At the conclusion of the experiment, the piglets were humanely slaughtered by bloodletting following electrical stunning. Subsequently, we isolated the ileum (terminal ileum) and colon (middle colon), collected digesta samples with sterile centrifuge tubes and stored those immediately in liquid nitrogen at −80 °C for microbiome or metabolite analysis (Figure S2). 2.3.

39220803,"The Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress on Reducing Recombinant Protein Production in Mammalian Cells. Therapeutic recombinant protein production relies on industrial scale culture of mammalian cells to produce active proteins in quantities sufficient for clinical use. The combination of stresses from industrial cell culture environment and recombinant protein production can overwhelm the protein synthesis machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This leads to a buildup of improperly folded proteins which induces ER stress. Cells respond to ER stress by activating the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). To restore proteostasis, ER sensor proteins reduce global protein synthesis and increase chaperone protein synthesis, and if that is insufficient the proteins are degraded. If proteostasis is still not restored, apoptosis is initiated. Increasing evidence suggests crosstalk between ER proteostasis and DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways. External factors (e.g., metabolites) from the cellular environment as well as internal factors (e.g., transgene copy number) can impact genome stability. Failure to maintain genome integrity reduces cell viability and in turn protein production. This review focuses on the association between ER stress and processes that affect protein production and secretion. The processes mediated by ER stress, including inhibition of global protein translation, chaperone protein production, degradation of misfolded proteins, DNA repair, and protein secretion, impact recombinant protein production. Recombinant protein production can be reduced by ER stress through increased autophagy and protein degradation, reduced protein secretion, and reduced DDR response.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6883,neg_MEDLINE,0.0017477858,0

39253640,"Exploring the Thermostability of CRISPR-Cas12b using Molecular Dynamics Simulations. INTRODUCTION. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) – Cas (CRISPR-associated protein) systems have emerged as revolutionary tools in the field of molecular biology. This system, originally a part of bacterial immune defenses, has been adapted to perform a myriad of tasks in genetic engineering, due to its precision and versatility. One of the latest advances in CRISPR/Cas involves using Cas proteins as components in molecular diagnostics, with applications ranging from infectious disease detection to genetic disorder diagnosis and cancer detection. Cas9 and dCas9 have been used to establish diagnostic systems for the detection of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and featured nucleic acid sequences in pathogenic strains. The discovery of indiscriminate cleavage of other non-specific single-stranded RNAs upon target binding, also referred to as trans-cleavage or collateral cleavage activity of CRISPR-Cas13a (C2c2) in 2016 brought a new era of CRISPR/Cas-based biosensing. Cas13a was utilized to establish a comprehensive diagnostic platform, SHERLOCK, which was further developed for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases. In addition to Cas13, Cas12a (Cpf1) was found to have collateral cleavage activity on other single-stranded DNAs. Specifically, upon binding to the intended nucleotide target, a non-target or collateral cleavage is triggered in the Cas protein which is distinct from specific cleavage activity. Collateral activity can be utilized to cleave DNA reporter, thereby magnifying the fluorescence signal and the sensitivity of the detection platform; this Cas12a-based nucleic acid detection platform, DETECTR, was reported by Chen et al. At the same time, Li et al. discovered a similar collateral cleavage effect in Cas12a and developed the nucleic acid sensing assay HOLMES. While the specificity and the simplicity of these nucleic acid detection assays are advantages, the requirement of separate steps to amplify the sample before the detection to increase sensitivity poses significant challenges, including possible carryover contamination, longer processing time, complexity in handling, often an increase in the overall cost of the assay. To address this, the integration of Cas proteins with a pre-amplification step, such as reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), has shown promise, as the integration allows for a sensitive nucleic acid detection method. However, the high-temperature nature of RT-LAMP, typically conducted at 65°C, denatures most native Cas proteins, hindering proper integration to create a simple one-step process. With the utilization of the Cas12b (C2c1), a thermophilic RNA-guided endonuclease from Class II type V-B CRISPR/Cas, Wang and others showed that with the same cleavage activity, pairing with LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) results in a one-step assay for convenient target detection. More recent efforts including the usage of AapCas12b, which is derived from Alicyclobacillus acidiphilus, and BrCas12b, which derived from Brevibacillys sp., as part of the one-step diagnostic assay for the detection of nucleic acids including SARS-CoV-2. Based on SHERLOCK, Joung et al. integrated RT-LAMP with AapCas12b, thereby achieving a one-step detection that exceeds the sensitivity of CDC RT-qPCR. Nguyen et al. simplified the detection process and reduced the carryover contamination by a one-pot assay developed using the newly identified thermostable Cas12b ortholog BrCas12b (with a melting temperature of 62 °C). Further optimization of the single-pot assay was achieved by the combination of de novo design through point mutations and experimental validation, resulting in a thermostable BrCas12b with a melting temperature of 67 °C (referred to as eBrCas12b) which does not degrade at the high operating temperatures (65 °C) of RT-LAMP. While these modifications have shown promising results, the underlying mechanisms of how these mutations contribute to increased thermal stability is not fully understood, nor do we know its influence on the overall dynamics of the protein, which could affect its cleavage process. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is a powerful tool to gain insights into the structure and dynamics of proteins, including the effects of mutations at the atomic level. MD simulations have been implemented previously to understand fundamental activation mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 systems, revealing high conformational flexibility of the HNH domain and providing insight into the dynamic behavior of Cas9. Palermo et al. performed a series of MD simulations on CRISPR-Cas9 systems to explore the conformational plasticity of the Cas9 protein and its interactions with nucleic acid during DNA binding. These studies revealed that the Cas9 protein undergoes significant conformational changes during the process of nucleic acid binding and processing. Meanwhile, the ‘closure’ of the protein relies on the highly coupled and specific motion between different domains. Saha et al. investigated the structural dynamics of different Cas12a orthologs and found that DNA binding induces changes in Cas12a conformational dynamics, which leads to the activation of REC2 and Nuc domains that enable the cleavage of nucleic acids, particularly the large amplitude motion of Nuc that allows the protein to open and close. The dynamics of REC2 and Nuc domain are highly coupled, and REC2 can act as a regulator of Nuc, which is similar to HNH in Cas9 system. While CRISPR-Cas9 has been extensively analyzed using MD simulations, there remains a significant gap in understanding other Cas proteins, such as Cas12. Considering the unique collateral cleavage mechanism of Cas12 and the difference in cleavage mechanism between Cas12b and Cas12a, a thorough analysis of Cas12b is needed for rationally designing variants of the protein. Particularly, MD simulations can provide insights into BrCas12b and eBrCas12b, shedding light on h",PMC,neg,0,neg,6898,neg_PMC,0.004943689,0
39265857,"Characterization of NLRP3 inflammasome components in the endangered Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus). Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) is the largest extant urodela species and has unique evolutionary position. Studying the immune system of Chinese giant salamander contributes to understanding the evolution of immune systems of vertebrates. The NLR-related protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome comprised of NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 play important roles in the host innate immunity. However, little is know about the NLRP3 inflammasome components in Chinese giant salamander. In this study, the NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) and caspase-1 (adaNLRP3, adaASC and adaCaspase-1) were characterized from Chinese giant salamander. The proteins of these three genes shared similar motifs and structures with their mammalian counterparts, with a PYD motif, a nucleotide-binding domain (NACHT) motif, and four leucine-rich repeat domain (LRR) motifs identified in adaNLRP3, a pyrin domain (PYD) motif and a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) motif in adaASC, and a CARD motif and a CASc motif in adaCaspase-1. These three genes were constitutively expressed in the skin, heart, lung, kidney, muscle, brain, spleen, and liver of Chinese giant salamander. Following Aeromonas hydrophia infection, all the three genes were up-regulated in various tissues. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the key residues involved in forming the adaNLRP3/adaASC complex were located in the PYD motifs, and that involved in forming the adaASC/adaCaspase-1 complex were located in the CARD motifs. Further analysis revealed that the hydrogen bonds and salt bridges had crucial roles in the formation of adaNLRP3/acaASC and adaASC/adaCaspase-1 complexes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the NLRP3 inflammasome components in Chinese giant salamander which will be helpful in further understanding the function of the NLRP3 inflammasome and in elucidating its role in the immune response to microbes.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,6902,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.20110625,0
39280331,"CRISPR/CasRx-Mediated Knockdown of Rab7B Restores Incomplete Cell Shape Induced by Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease-Associated PLP1 p.Ala243Val. INTRODUCTION. The central nervous system (CNS) is composed of various types of tissues and cells, including neuronal and glial cells. Oligodendrocytes, also known as oligodendroglial cells, are the glial cells responsible for forming myelin sheaths in the CNS. These myelin sheaths around neuronal axons are derived of differentiated oligodendroglial cell plasma membranes and play critical roles in the efficient transmission of nerve impulses and the protection of axons. Collected areas of differentiated oligodendroglial cell plasma membranes often reach more than fifty times the size of those of pre-myelinating cell plasma membranes at least in rodent model. Therefore, improper formation or damage to myelin sheaths due to physiological and physical stresses can lead to serious neurodegenerative diseases. Hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 1 [HLD1], also known as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), is one such disease, characterized by X-linked recessive hypomyelination and/or demyelination. HLD1, often caused by duplication, multiplication, or mutation of the gene encoding PLP1, triggers significant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and a subsequent unfolded protein response (UPR) throughout the cell body. This leads to incomplete oligodendroglial cell morphological differentiation and the generation of incomplete myelin sheaths. It is therefore believed that mitigating ER stress and UPR contributes, at least in part, to normal morphological differentiation and the generation of mature myelin sheaths. Rab proteins, which belong to the small GTP/GDP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily, exist in either the active GTP-bound or the inactive GDP-bound forms. They control the transportation of various intracellular vesicles. Similar to other small GTP/GDP-binding proteins, Rab proteins are switching regulated by GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Each Rab protein localizes to specific cellular vesicles and intracellular membranes, essentially acting as a flag for the intracellular component. Consequently, they control vesicular budding, trafficking, and fusion, impacting cell states in both health and disease. It is believed that Rab7A generally participates in the transport and degradation of proteins in the endosome and the lysosome, from yeast to mammalian cells. Similarly, it is thought that Rab7B (also known as Rab42), a Rab7 subfamily branch molecule, is localized in vesicular organelles around the lysosome and may participate in transporting proteins toward the direction of the trans-Golgi network. We previously reported that knockdown of Rab7B using the specific small interfering (si)RNA restores morphological changes induced by a drug that triggers ER stress in an oligodendroglial cell line FBD-102b. This cell line has the ability to undergo oligodendroglial cell-like morphological differentiation with widespread plasma membranes before myelination events. As the next step, we analyzed the effects of Rab7B knockdown on cells harboring the HLD1-associated Ala-243-to-Val (A243V) mutation (also known as p.Ala243Val) of PLP1. This mutation is known to induce ER stress and trigger UPR, leading to incompletely differentiated, undifferentiated, and/or hypomyelinating oligodendroglial cell phenotypes. Using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CasRx (also known as Cas13d) system-mediated knockdown approach, we observed the recovery of cell morphology in cells harboring PLP1 with the A243V mutation. These findings suggest that Rab7B could be a potential drug target molecule for HLD1, at least at the molecular and cellular levels. RESULTS. Transfection of PLP1 with the A243V mutation into FBD-102b cells decreased oligodendroglial cell-like differentiated phenotypes with widespread membranes compared to the control transfection (Figure S1, upper images). Similar results were obtained in the case of cells stably harboring PLP1 with the A243V mutation (Figure S1, lower images). The small difference in differentiation potential between cells harboring PLP1 with the A243V mutation and the controls is likely due to the lack of a culture system in which pathological changes take years to develop, as occurs in the disease. On the other hand, transfection of wild type PLP1 into cells did not significantly affect their morphologies (Figure S2). Under these experimental conditions, we examined whether cells harboring PLP1 with the A243V mutation could be recovered by knockdown of Rab7B, which negatively regulates morphological changes. As a result, specific knockdown of Rab7B using CRISPR/CasRx system-fitted gRNA was confirmed at the RNA and protein levels (Figure S3). The knockdown successfully recovered morphological changes in cells harboring PLP1 with the A243V mutation (Figure 1). Comparatively, knockdown of Rab7B slightly increased morphological changes in cells harboring wild type PLP1 (Figure 2) or mock-transfected cells (Figure 3). The finding in cells harboring PLP1 with the A243V mutation in a Rab7B-knocked down background was supported by increased expression levels of oligodendroglial cell differentiation and myelination marker proteins 2′, 3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and the pi molecule of glutathione S-transferase (GSTpi), whereas the expression levels of actin as the internal control protein were comparable in Rab7B- and control-knocked down cells (Figure S4). We failed to use PLP1 as the differentiation marker, since we utilized cells harboring wild type or mutated PLP1. The expression levels of heat shock protein family A member 5 (HSPA5), a typical marker of ER stress response, were decreased following knockdown of Rab7B (Figure S4), suggesting that its knockdown has the ability to recover defective morphological changes. As comparative experiments, we examined the effects of Rab7B knockdown on the expression levels of CNPase, GSTpi, and HSPA5 in cells harboring wild type PLP1 (Figure S5) or",PMC,neg,0,neg,6911,neg_PMC,0.004248079,0
39286502,"Redox-dependent condensation and cytoplasmic granulation by human ssDNA-binding protein-1 delineate roles in oxidative stress response. SUMMARY. Human single-stranded DNA binding protein 1 (hSSB1/NABP2/OBFC2B) plays central roles in DNA repair. Here, we show that purified hSSB1 undergoes redox-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the presence of single-stranded DNA or RNA, features that are distinct from those of LLPS by bacterial SSB. hSSB1 nucleoprotein droplets form under physiological ionic conditions in response to treatment modeling cellular oxidative stress. hSSB1’s intrinsically disordered region is indispensable for LLPS, whereas all three cysteine residues of the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold are necessary to maintain redox-sensitive droplet formation. Proteins interacting with hSSB1 show selective enrichment inside hSSB1 droplets, suggesting tight content control and recruitment functions for the condensates. While these features appear instrumental for genome repair, we detected cytoplasmic hSSB1 condensates in various cell lines colocalizing with stress granules upon oxidative stress, implying extranuclear function in cellular stress response. Our results suggest condensation-linked roles for hSSB1, linking genome repair and cytoplasmic defense. INTRODUCTION. Single-stranded (ss) DNA binding (SSB) proteins are found in all living organisms. Their main function is the binding and stabilization of exposed ssDNA regions that form during DNA metabolic processes including replication, recombination, and repair. Protection of ssDNA regions from nucleolytic cleavage, unproductive secondary structure formation and harmful chemical alterations is essential for genome integrity. Moreover, SSBs specifically interact with several other proteins participating in genome maintenance, conferring an organizing hub function for SSBs in DNA metabolism., A 19-kDa subunit of the “prototypic” homotetrameric SSB of Escherichia coli (EcSSB) comprises an N-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold followed by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) (Figure 1A). Besides mitochondrial SSB, the heterotrimeric replication protein A (RPA) was considered as the only functional metazoan SSB until the discovery of SSB homologs SSB1 and SSB2 (termed hSSB1/NABP2/OBFC2B and hSSB2/NABP1/OBFC2A, respectively, in humans). hSSB1 and hSSB2 share high structural similarity to EcSSB, having an N-terminal OB fold followed by C-terminal IDR (Figures 1A and 1B)., hSSB1 is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, while hSSB2 expression is tissue specific, restricted mainly to immune cells and testes. Growing evidence highlights central functions for hSSB1 in DNA repair, telomere maintenance, RNA transcription, and embryonic development. While hSSB1 appears to perform wide-ranging cellular functions, most of our knowledge comes from studies focusing on its DNA repair function. hSSB1 was shown to be an early sensor of DNA damage upon ionizing radiation (IR), whereby it localizes to DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair foci and organizes subsequent homologous recombination (HR) mediated DNA repair., hSSB1 facilitates DNA end resection, an early step in HR, by recruiting the MRN complex and stimulating Exo1 activity. D-loop formation by RAD51 recombinase, a key step in early HR, is also facilitated by hSSB1. hSSB1 colocalizes with Bloom’s syndrome helicase (BLM) on IR-induced DSBs. While hSSB1 is dispensable for normal S-phase DNA replication, it is required for stabilization and restart of replication forks that collapse upon hydroxyurea treatment. Another major role of hSSB1 is exerted during the repair of oxidative DNA damage (such as formation of 8-oxoguanine) via the hOGG1-mediated base excision repair (BER) pathway. hSSB1 relocalizes to chromatin after H2O2-induced oxidative stress to recruit hOGG1 to sites of damage and to stimulate its incision activity. While EcSSB is a stable homotetramer, the ability of hSSB proteins to self-oligomerize appears more dynamic and is of functional significance. Under reducing conditions, hSSB1 was shown to be dominantly monomeric., However, unlike EcSSB that lacks cysteines, hSSB1 contains three conserved cysteine residues (at amino acid (aa) positions 41, 81, and 99; Figure 1B) that could potentially facilitate redox-dependent covalent oligomerization via disulfide bonds. Vertebrate SSB1 orthologs show a high degree of sequence conservation, including the presence of all three cysteine residues (Figure 1C). hSSB1 was indeed shown to oligomerize covalently upon oxidative stress, with this feature being abolished by the C99S or C41S substitutions. Based on the observed oligomerization propensity and tetrameric structure of other SSBs, Touma et al. proposed a structural model in which the hSSB1 tetramer is stabilized by C81-C81 and C99-C99 intermolecular disulfide bridges, whereas C41 buried inside the OB fold may act as a redox sensor, with its oxidative status allosterically influencing protein structure. Although the structures of hSSB1 oligomeric forms have not been experimentally clarified, oxidation-dependent hSSB1 oligomerization was found necessary for efficient hOGG1-mediated BER and also for enhanced hSSB1 binding to DNA containing oxidative lesions, but appears dispensable for DSB repair. Furthermore, hSSB1 was observed as a monomer in the ternary SOSS (sensor of ssDNA) complex formed with Integrator complex subunit 3 (INTS3) and SOSS complex subunit C (INIP, C9Orf80, hSSBIP1) proteins., hSSB1 directly interacts with INTS3, and the complex plays an essential role in HR-mediated DSB repair via ATM activation, RAD51 recruitment to DNA damage,,, and facilitation of DSB resection by Exo1. Recently, a novel phosphorylation-dependent interaction between MRN and INTS3 in the SOSS1 complex was also shown to facilitate MRN recruitment to DSBs. SOSS1 complex formation is independent of DNA damage, while INTS3 knockdown results in a decrease in nuclear hSSB1 foci after irradiation. INTS3 is required for the transcription of hSSB1; thus, the knockdown phenotype is rescued b",PMC,pos,1,pos,6919,pos_PMC,0.99744415,1
39326286,"Investigate potential clinical benefits and linear energy transfer sparing utilizing proton arc therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. PURPOSE To investigate the potential clinical benefits and dose-averaged Linear Energy Transfer (LETd) sparing, utilizing proton arc plan for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in comparison with Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT). METHODS Ten HCC patients have been retrospectively selected. Two planning groups were created: Proton Arc plans using Monaco ver. 6 and the clinical IMPT plan. Both planning groups used the same robustness parameters. The prescription dose is 67.5 Gy (RBE) in 15 fractions of the Clinical Target Volume (CTV). Robustness evaluations were performed to ensure dose coverage. Normal Tissue Complicated Probability (NTCP) model was utilized to predict the possibility of Radiation-Induced Liver Disease (RILD) and evaluate the potential benefit of proton arc therapy. LETd calculation and evaluation were performed as well. RESULTS Proton arc plan has shown better dosimetric improvements of most Organ-At-Risks (OARs). More specifically, the liver mean dose has been significantly reduced from 14.7 GyE to 10.62 GyE compared to the IMPT plan. The predicted possibility of RILD has also been significantly reduced for cases with a large and deep liver target where healthy liver tissue sparing is a challenge. Additionally, proton arc therapy could increase the average LETd in the target and reduce LETd in adjacent OARs. CONCLUSIONS The potential clinical benefit of utilizing proton arc therapy HCC varies depending on the patient-specific geometry. With more freedom, proton arc therapy can offer a better dosimetric plan quality in the challenge cases, which might not be feasible using the current IMPT technique.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,6936,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0019380354,0
39334953,"Improving Circulation Half-Life of Therapeutic Candidate N-TIMP2 by Unfolded Peptide Extension. 1. INTRODUCTION. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of 23 human enzymes that play a crucial role in degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), tissue remodeling, immunity, and wound healing [1,2]. Abnormal MMP activity has been implicated in the development and progression of several diseases, including different cancers, vascular diseases, arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and others [3]. Several types of MMPs are upregulated in cancers and facilitate metastasis because they are directly involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Additionally, they are indirectly involved in the regulation of cellular functions and signaling through proteolysis of inhibitors and signaling factors in the tumor and its microenvironment [4,5]. Much effort has been invested in the development of therapeutics to control improperly regulated MMP activity [6]. Early efforts for targeting MMPs concentrated on designing small-molecule MMP inhibitors that target highly conserved active sites centered on a catalytic zinc ion. These small molecules showed broad-spectrum activity, not differentiating between various MMP targets and frequently binding other homologous proteins in the body, resulting in high toxicity [7,8,9]. Recent efforts have shifted toward developing therapeutic antibodies [10,11], which can achieve better selectivity for targeting individual MMPs through a larger interaction interface, but these, too, have limitations, notably their difficulty in discriminating between active MMPs and their more abundant zymogen precursors [11,12]. While a number of such antibodies are presently undergoing clinical trials, none of them have been approved as drugs so far. As an alternative to antibodies, the four tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP1–4) or their N-terminal domains (N-TIMPs) could be used as anti-MMP drug candidates. These inhibitors possess high affinity to all active MMPs and, as endogenous proteins, are nontoxic and nonimmunogenic in humans [13]. For example, TIMP2 has been demonstrated to effectively reduce MMP-related inflammation as well as to suppress tumor growth and metastasis in the models of triple negative breast cancer [14]. Furthermore, TIMPs can be engineered to bind with high affinity and specificity to specific disease-associated MMPs [15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Therefore, TIMP-based therapeutics are promising tools to suppress and control cancers and other MMP-related diseases. Yet, TIMP variants as small proteins (~15–20 kDa) possess short circulation half-lives. For example, full-length recombinantly produced human TIMP1 with a molecular weight of ~20 kDa is eliminated from mice with a half-life of only 1.1 h [24]. Rapid clearance from the bloodstream can limit the therapeutic effect of a TIMP, as it may not reach a sufficient concentration to exert the desired effects on MMPs. To facilitate the success of TIMPs as therapeutics, we set our goal to extend their half-life using a protein engineering approach. Several approaches have been developed to prolong the half-life of therapeutic proteins and improve their delivery methods. PEGylation, which involves covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers, is currently the most commonly used method for increasing the half-life of biologics [25,26] and has been successfully applied to extend TIMP1 circulation half-life in mice [24]. However, PEGylation, when performed on cysteine or lysine residues, can lead to a reduction in protein activity. Moreover, if the conjugation site is not unique, PEGylation produces polydispersed conjugation of the sample, an undesirable property for therapeutic proteins. To address the issue of polydispersion, a noncanonical amino acid was introduced into N-TIMP2, and PEG polymer was conjugated to the protein using click chemistry [27]. This approach resulted in an approximately eight-fold extension of the N-TIMP2 elimination half-life. Nevertheless, the costly nature of protein expression with noncanonical amino acids poses a challenge to large-scale protein production using this method. Alternative strategies for extending therapeutic protein half-life can avoid the complexities of chemical modification by relying instead on genetic fusions to create larger composite proteins with the desired pharmacokinetic properties. Examples include fusion to serum proteins with long half-lives such as albumin [28,29]. Previously, TIMP2 has been fused to human serum albumin, resulting in improved protein yield and an extended elimination half-life [30]. However, a potential drawback of this approach is that fusion with albumin or other human proteins could lead to interactions with other biological components, causing the protein to localize to unintended targets, potentially resulting in undesired effects. Another type of genetic fusion aims to enlarge the protein via the addition of a long, intrinsically unfolded tail composed of natural amino acids. “PASylation” achieves this aim by appending a long amino acid stretch that contains a random combination of proline (P), alanine (A), and serine (S) residues [31]. The flexible tail adopts multiple conformations and effectively increases the hydrodynamic radius of the protein without affecting protein activity. This strategy is advantageous since the tail is chemically monodispersed (of uniform length and tethered at a single attachment point), applicable over a wide range of expression hosts, biodegradable, and economical since the protein is expressed with the tail already incorporated [31]. PASylation has been explored for at least 15 biological molecules, where it successfully improved protein elimination half-life and in some cases also enhanced therapeutic protein stability and activity [31,32]. The broader strategy of modulating protein behavior using intrinsically unfolded extensions is still in its infancy, and studies that further explore the sequence requirements for such unfolded tails and the",PMC,neg,0,neg,6940,neg_PMC,0.009859855,0

Given the intimate connection between the structure and function of biological macromolecules, the ability to temporally control their unfolding-refolding process enables temporal regulation over specific functionalities, potentially applicable in innovative domains, including the construction of protein-based actuators or programmable catalysis and drug release in complex biotechnological processes. We show here how a temporally controlled protein unfolding-refolding cycle can be coupled in time with programmed pH sequences achieved through the spontaneous decomposition of an activated carboxylic acid. Specifically, we illustrate this process at the molecular level using albumin, the most prevalent protein found in plasma, for which a temporary shift from native to unfolded forms is promoted using nitroacetic acid, able to undergo base-catalysed decarboxylation when solubilized in water solution. As detected by small angle X-ray scattering and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, starting from the protein in its native form, the acid addition triggers unfolding to a partially denatured state and a subsequent time-tunable pH rise with gradual refolding that recapitulates the intermediate steps detected at the same pH values by static acidification, fitting within a framework of full reversibility of the structural changes as a function of the protein protonation state. At the end of the pH jump, the native structure is fully recovered, making this method a chemical tool to achieve a complete protein conformational sequence programmed in the timeframe of minutes without further intervention.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,6948,neg_MEDLINE,0.003586616,0
39376467,"Sow reproductive and progeny growth performance when fed Pichia guilliermondii yeast postbiotic: systematic review and meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION. Over the past three decades, pig breeding strategies have aimed to increase litter size and minimize piglet mortality. These improvements in sow performance parameters are well known to decrease not only production costs but also decrease the environmental footprint per kg of pork produced (Knap et al., 2023). Dietary interventions are one of the available strategies to further increase sow productive performance. Among them, biotics are defined as nonnutritive components that cover the concepts of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics. The appearance of the term postbiotics has increased dramatically in published literature since 2020. In contrast to live microorganisms known as probiotics, postbiotics are defined as the “preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host” (Salminen et al., 2021). Many different postbiotics are currently used in feed for livestock, among which are yeast-based products. Previous research suggested that heat-inactivated Pichia guilliermondii yeast, a co-product of citric acid fermentation, had the potential to promote improved reproductive performance of sows (Bass et al., 2019; Thayer et al., 2023). However, such products generally suffer from a lack of consistent effects on animal performance. Therefore, the intent of this study was to conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the effects of an inactivated P. guilliermondii yeast postbiotic (PG; Citristim, ADM Animal Nutrition, Quincy, IL) supplemented to sows during gestation and lactation, on the reproductive performance of sows, and growth performance of piglets prior to and after weaning. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This report contains data from previously conducted research. No additional animals were used to perform this work, therefore no animal care and use protocol was necessary. DATA SOURCES AND DESCRIPTION OF THE DATABASES. The first step in conducting a meta-analysis is to run a systematic review of all reports available on the concerned topic to identify relevant literature. The literature search and study selection were performed following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statements (Page et al., 2021). The meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of feeding sows an inactivated strain-specific P. guilliermondii yeast product (PG; Citristim, ADM Animal Nutrition, Quincy, IL) on the productive performance of sows and their progeny after weaning. To retrieve published and unpublished reports, a literature search was performed through online academic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Mendeley, Web of Science, and ADM company’s internal trial database. The search strategy included the words “Citristim” OR “Pichia” OR “P. guilliermondii” AND “sow”, and included trials finalized until the end of December 2023. Authors independently screened relevant research reports identified by the search strategy. A total of 19 reports were initially identified through the literature search for sow and postweaning performance combined. Next, an exclusion phase was completed to remove reports that did not comply with the scope of the work or did not meet quality requirements. Of the 19 reports identified, there were reports excluded because they were present in duplicate (10), they deviated from the protocol (1), or they did not meet eligibility criteria (2). Not meeting eligibility criteria could include if PG was only fed during lactation and not gestation and lactation, or if there was a lack of clarity in raw data. After exclusion criteria were applied, six reports remained for evaluation and raw data were available for all of them. Two reports presented only sow performance (Thayer et al., 2023 and Unpublished Canadian trial), whereas four reports presented both sow and postweaning piglet performance outcomes. The manuscripts published by Bass et al. (2019; 2013), Thayer et al. (2020; 2022), Unpublished French trials, and Hernandez et al. (2021) shared data from the same report covering the sow and postweaning piglet performances, respectively. Hernandez et al. (2021) reported 2 sow studies each paired with postweaning piglet performance. Study 1 (sows and piglets) was excluded because PG was fed only during lactation. In study 2, the postweaning piglet performance was included in the meta-analysis but the sow performance was excluded from the database because there was a lack of clarity in the raw data. In total, there were seven trials organized in 5 reports presenting results on sow performance and eight trials organized in four reports for piglet performance after weaning. Each trial is the comparison of CON or PG fed sows, or their piglets in the nursery, at the same dose of PG, the same method of weighing the pigs, the same experiment within the report, or the same block of the experiment. Characteristics of the studies included in the analyses are given in Tables 1 and 2. Trials were included only if they were randomized trials that reported side-by-side comparisons of sows fed a basal diet (CON) compared to sows fed the same diet supplemented with PG during gestation and lactation over one reproductive cycle. Those trials had to report data on sow performance at birth and weaning of offspring, or on the performance of piglets after weaning known as the carryover effect. In addition, the sample size of experimental groups, the mean of each parameter and standard deviation (SD) were necessary information for trials to be included in the database. Raw data were used for thev calculations described. Trials were excluded if PG was fed in combination with another product. Evaluation of data were divided into two sections which include sow performance at farrowing and weaning, and piglet performance after weaning. The first section, evaluation of sow performance, was assessed through total number of piglets born (born alive + stillborn + mummies; BA + SB",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,6951,far_neg_PMC,0.0023231625,0
39394963,"A novel ER stress regulator ARL6IP5 induces reticulophagy to ameliorate the prion burden. INTRODUCTION. Prion diseases (PrDs) are incurable, rapid and only infectious neurodegenerative disorders. PrDs are highly transmissible across the species, hence also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy/TSE. The main causative agent of PrDs are “prions”, which leads to the trans-conformational conversion of the cellular form of PRNP/PrP (PRNP/PrPC) to infectious scrapie form (PRNP/PrPSc) by well-established protein-only hypothesis [1–4]. Cellular PRNP/PrP is a highly glycosylated protein that undergoes folding and post-translationally modified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [5]. Manifestation of PRNP/PrPSc via sporadically, genetically, or acquired form interrupts normal protein folding of PRNP/PrPC in ER and leads to the generation of unfolded, misfolded PRNP/PrP and eventually formation of PRNP/PrPSc [6]. Chronic accumulation of prion-like misfolded proteins in the ER lumen perturbs ER homeostasis and generates ER stress [7]. Earlier studies on clinical human brain samples as well as on prion animal and cellular models have shown elevated ER stress owing to severe accumulation of unfolded PRNP/PrPC and PRNP/PrPSc [8]. These observations suggest a direct link between prion disease and ER stress. Perturbation of ER function activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore ER homeostasis. Activated UPR elevates the expression of proteins that are involved in the improvement of protein folding such as ER-associated degradation/ERAD through proteasome, and attenuates the global protein synthesis [9]. Failure of the adaptive mechanism of UPR to release ER stress, triggers cell death in neurons and causes neuronal loss and spongiosis, which is one of the hallmarks of prion disease [10]. ER stress markers such as HSPA5/BiP/GRP78, HSP90B1/GRP94, PDIA3/GRP58, and EIF2AK3/PERK are chronically elevated in the cerebral cortex region of postmortem brains of prion disease patients, prion mice, and cellular models of prion disease. Deposition of prion protein aggregates owing to ER-associated degradation incompetent function is the major reason behind synaptic failure in PrDs [11,12]. In prion disease, studies have shown that ER stress, ER quality control mechanisms, and prion proliferation are intricately connected with each other. During the ER stress induction, accumulation of detergent insoluble PRNP/PrP aggregates leads to increased PRNP/PrPSc burden in both non-infected and infected cells [13]. Also, protein misfolding cyclic amplification/PMCA showed that under ER stress conditions, unfolded PRNP/PrP aggregates are more likely to convert into PRNP/PrPSc [14]. The ER stress caused by the accumulation of PRNP/PrPSc and unfolded PRNP/PrP raises the possibility that ER stress regulators might play a significant role to provide therapeutic approach in preventing prion disease. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal-mediated catabolic process, mainly degrades unfolded or misfolded, long lived, insoluble protein aggregates and damaged or superfluous organelles from the cytosol [15]. Autophagy is mainly classified as a bulk or selective degradation pathway [16]. As for the ER, selective removal of subdomains of ER from bulk ER is called reticulophagy [17]. Recently, a number of research articles highlighted the different types of reticulophagy involved in restoration of ER homeostasis to release ER stress [9]. ER sites either damaged or enriched in proteasome-resistant protein aggregates are targeted by reticulophagy through different reticulophagy receptors. These receptors are soluble or ER-resident proteins containing LC3 binding sites and ER resident protein interacting region [17–23]. The ability of reticulophagy to selectively degrade unfolded or misfolded protein aggregates via releasing ER stress provides a platform to explore the effective neuroprotective approach against fatal prion disease. In the present study, we deciphered the role of ARL6IP5 (ADP ribosylation factor-like GTPase 6 interacting protein 5) protein in the cellular model of prion disease (RML-ScN2a). ARL6IP5/JWA/Addicsin/GTRAP3-18/JM4 is an environmental response protein that has four transmembrane domains. ARL6IP5 protein forms a homo or heterodimer complex to perform its largely unknown functions [24]. ARL6IP5 is an ubiquitously expressed protein that belongs to the prenylated RAB acceptor family and might play a role in protein trafficking [25]. The induced ARL6IP5 protein expression was detected during stress causing stimuli, suggesting its role in pathophysiological conditions [26]. Recently work from our group reported the role of ARL6IP5 as a bulk autophagy inducer that degrades cytoplasmic synuclein aggregates[27]. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the mechanistic role of ARL6IP5 in the chronically activated ER stress induced UPR during prion disease and its effect on prion (PRNP/PrPSc) burden. RESULTS. ARL6IP5 OVEREXPRESSION REDUCES PRION BURDEN IN RML-SCN2A CELLS. The formation of PRNP/PrPSc and its aggregate accumulation is the most fundamental process in prion disease. The conventional cellular model of prion disease produces PRNP/PrPSc, resistant to proteinase K (PK) treatment. In the present study, we employed a cellular model of prion disease containing prion-infected RML-ScN2a cells that produce PK-resistant PRNP/PrPSc and N2a cells as a control (Figure S1 A-C). In order to investigate the role of ARL6IP5 in prion disease, we detected baseline mRNA expression of Arl6ip5 using qPCR. As shown in Figure 1A, the mRNA level of the Arl6ip5 gene significantly increased in RML-ScN2a cells. This increased expression of ARL6IP5 at the basal level was also confirmed using immunoblotting (Figure 1B,C). To test whether modulation of ARL6IP5 expression could affect the prion (PRNP/PrPSc) burden, we used overexpression and knockdown approach. The overexpressed ARL6IP5 was denoted as ARL6IP5[OE] and siRNA-mediated knockdown of ARL6IP5 was denoted as ARL6IP5[KD] in RML-ScN2a and N2a cells. Th",PMC,neg,0,neg,6956,neg_PMC,0.005968731,0

39457489,"Resveratrol Effect on α-Lactalbumin Thermal Stability. 1. INTRODUCTION. α-lactalbumin (α-LA), one of the major whey proteins, has received significant interest due to its unique properties and potential therapeutic applications. The structure of α-LA presents two lobes separated by a cleft. One lobe consists of α-helices, whereas the other comprises β-sheets and unordered structures [1]. An essential characteristic of α-LA is its ability to bind metal cations [2]. Calcium binding enables protein stability and is an important factor for proper folding [3]. The primary calcium binding site in α-LA connects the two lobes [4]. Recent studies revealed potential therapeutic effects of α-LA in various health conditions: metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer [5,6,7]. Bactericidal activity of α-LA has also been reported [8]. The protein interacts with other bioactive compounds with various functional characteristics involved in food science [9,10]. To acquire a better understanding of bioactive compound transport and metabolism, it is necessary to explore the interactions between these ligands and carrier proteins. The interaction of milk proteins with biologically active molecules is an important aspect in the development of dairy products and healthy diets. The interaction of α-LA with retinol and palmitic acid [9] shows the potential of using α-LA for the encapsulation of hydrophobic compounds. α-LA binds and transports drugs such as vitamin D, genistein, kaempferol, and EGCG with high affinity [11,12,13]. Protein aggregation involves the occurrence of conformation changes due to misfolding, which further results in aggregates or fibril formation [14]. A significant number of human diseases are linked to protein aggregation, generating interest not only in medical sciences but also in biochemistry, biophysics, and biotechnology. Although α-LA is not directly involved in any amyloidosis disease, it is a model protein for misfolding and aggregation studies as it can form different folding intermediates under varying conditions. The literature studies report the folding and unfolding of α-LA at different pH values. Apo α-LA (calcium-depleted form) was reported to undergo conformational changes caused by calcium removal that results in aggregate formation near the protein’s characteristic pI (4.0–5.0) [15,16,17]. Protein aggregation is also an important characteristic associated with food processing, closely related to dairy product stability and quality. The aggregation behavior of whey proteins might modify their viscosity, foaming, emulsification, and antioxidant and antibacterial properties. The understanding of the heat-induced unfolding, aggregation and gelation mechanisms under different environmental conditions is important for the development of various functional foods. Various types of molecules, of natural and synthetic origin, were tested (in vitro and in vivo) to estimate their anti-amyloid action. The most promising results were obtained with several natural molecules, particularly polyphenols with a proven efficacy against protein aggregation. Among natural polyphenols, resveratrol was chosen for two reasons: (i) its influence on protein thermal stability is less studied; and (ii) there are several documented applications of RESV in medical and food science, particularly in connection/interaction with whey proteins. The main problem in RESV utilization consists of its low aqueous solubility that limits bioavailability. Binding to carrier proteins is a feasible solution to this problem and allows for higher serum concentration of resveratrol. Whey proteins like α-lactalbumin are good carrier candidates due to their binding affinity for RESV. Moreover, they exhibit good nutritional features at a low price. Polyphenol–protein interaction has received much attention in recent years. Whey proteins are involved in noncovalent interactions with polyphenols and serve as delivery vehicles. Different studies reported the interaction of polyphenols with casein [18], bovine serum albumin (BSA) [19,20,21], lysozyme [22], β-lactoglobulin [23], and α-lactalbumin [24,25]. Our previous investigations revealed that polyphenolic compounds present various effects on protein thermal stability in a concentration-dependent manner [26,27,28]. Polyphenols present a research interest due to their health beneficial effects, especially in the treatment and prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases [29]. One important aspect of the interaction between natural polyphenolic compounds and milk proteins consists of its reciprocal effects: protein–phenol interactions might modify bioavailability of both proteins and phenols [30]. Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), RESV, is a naturally occurring phenolic compound found in plants with numerous health benefits: antioxidant, cardioprotective, anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects [31]. Resveratrol binds to β-lactoglobulin without changing the protein secondary structure. A non-specific binding of resveratrol on the surface of the protein and self-association of resveratrol at high concentrations were proposed [32]. The interaction of bovine α-lactalbumin with curcumin and trans-resveratrol [33] was investigated by fluorescence-quenching measurements and docking studies. Trans-resveratrol binds in the vicinity of Trp-60 and Trp-104 of α-LA, with the binding stoichiometry of 1:1, and hydrogen bonds contribute to the stability of the complex. Therefore, the present study focuses on the interactions between α-LA and RESV and investigates the effect of resveratrol on the thermal stability of α-LA using DSC, CD spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. Moreover, molecular docking provided the probable binding site of the ligand to the protein. This research presents a novel approach for evaluating α-LA thermal stability in time, at different temperatures and ligand concentrations that may be used to develop novel aggregation inhibitors and anti-amyloid therapeutics. 2.

39459886,"Viral Infections and Their Ability to Modulate Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response Pathways. 1. IMPACT STATEMENT. Viruses and their hosts have been co-evolving for billions of years. As a result, cells have developed countless strategies to cope with the deleterious effects caused by virus infections. However, evolution works both ways, and the parasitic viruses have also evolved numerous counteractions to deal with cell strategies to eliminate them. The unfolded protein response pathways may have evolved as an antiviral strategy, as a way to deal with stressful massive protein production in the endoplasmic reticulum caused by replicating viruses, leading to cell death and infection elimination. Not surprisingly, virus have developed strategies to cope with UPR responses, blocking death signaling triggered by UPR sensors, and even taking advantage of pro-life signals that cells use to restore ER homeostasis. Here, we visit known strategies devised by viruses to counteract or benefit from cellular unfolded protein responses. 2. INTRODUCTION. Most proteins synthesized by eukaryotic cells are cytoplasmic. However, a significant percentage is destined for endo/exocytic pathways. To this end, these proteins have a signal sequence marking them for translocation from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. Protein synthesis with the signal sequence occurs mainly on ribosomes attached to the ER membrane, and the signal sequence helps direct the ribosome to the organelle membrane [1,2]. The ER lumen is a unique environment that contains the highest concentration of Ca2+ ions within the cell due to the active transport of Ca2+ ions by calcium ATPases. When compared to the cytosol, the ER lumen is an oxidative environment, and that is essential for the formation of molecular bridges and disulfide bonds in maturing proteins, stabilizing the protein structure. Because proteins are translocated as unfolded polypeptide chains, the lumen ER contains a myriad of calcium-dependent chaperones, lectins, foldases, and glucosidases that assist in the correct folding and assembly of proteins, allowing the acquisition of functional and stable tertiary and quaternary structures. The ER is a multifunctional organelle that ensures the correct structure of proteins’ coils and has a key role in the synthesis of lipids, sterols, and maintenance of calcium intracellularly [3,4]. As a result of being such an instrumental organelle, the ER is sensitive to disturbances on cellular homeostasis that are triggered by different types of stress signals, which may be of endogenous or exogenous origin and include, for example, cell chemical damage, harmful genetic mutations, nutrient insufficiency, cell differentiation, and also infections by different pathogens [5,6,7]. In eukaryotic cells, accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER works as a danger signal detected by different resident sensors in the organelle’s membrane. Activation of such sensors triggers chemical cascades that culminate in the expression of chaperones and foldases, components of the degradation system associated with the ER (the ERAD), protein secretion, and increase in phospholipid synthesis. All these countermeasures contribute to the recovery of the ER functionality and cell homeostasis. The coordinated activation of the sensors constitutes a specific response to ER stress, a physiological condition called the malformed protein response or UPR [8,9,10,11,12]. The UPR can be found from simple to more complex organisms from yeasts to mammals [13]. Indeed, all eukaryotes share similar mechanisms for coping with ER stress, including the increased expression of chaperones that are responsible for the refolding of proteins, and proteases that degrade irreversibly unfolded proteins. In yeasts, for example, the increased levels of unfolded proteins can lead to the production of a specific transcription factor that triggers the increased expression of chaperones. All Metazoans also have an additional mechanism to deal with ER stress: the attenuation of translation by inhibiting the formation of a complex between the two ribosomal subunits [14]. Quite similarly, mammalian cells can increase chaperone levels regulated by transcription factors that are produced as a result of the activation of a protein homologous to the one found in the yeast UPR pathway (which was the first to be characterized). From an evolutionary perspective, as organisms gained complexity, there was also an increase in the UPR pack of tools, with the gain of a number of molecules affecting a great number of cellular mechanisms. Initially, the restoration of cellular homeostasis was linked to the transcriptional and translational regulation, processes well studied in mammals [13,15]. A paradox of the UPR pathway is that it leads to a response with simultaneous activation of cell survival and pro-apoptotic pathways [16,17,18]. The first discovery and best-characterized pro-apoptotic pathway is the production of the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) also known as growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153), which is regulated by all arms of the UPR pathway [8,9,19]. The mechanism by which CHOP leads to cell death is still unclear. However, this regulation occurs through the transcriptional and post-translational modification of various BCL-2 family members involved in the core mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. During prolonged ER stress, ATF4 promotes apoptosis by increasing the expression of the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein and by elevating oxidative stress and protein synthesis levels [8,20]. CHOP also induces the transcription of ER oxidoreductases, such as ERO1a, making the lumen of the reticular cisternae a super-oxidizing environment that participates in cell death. CHOP protein production “fluctuates” over time, being robustly induced in the initial phase after exposure of cells to stress-inducing drugs, followed by a decline in CHOP levels, whereas chaperones remain upregulate",PMC,neg,0,neg,6982,neg_PMC,0.0024968276,0
39463949,"DNA flexibility regulates transcription factor binding to nucleosomes. In eukaryotes, gene expression programs are dynamically regulated by changes in the accessibility of chromatin for transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA motifs (6–10 bp). TFs that can pioneer inaccessible chromatin for subsequent transcriptional activity thus serve as gatekeepers of cellular differentiation. However, it remains unclear which TFs are able to target sites within nucleosomes and what controls their pioneer binding. Several, not mutually exclusive models for how TFs access their nucleosomal DNA binding sites have been proposed, such as competition between TFs and histones for DNA binding or spontaneous, partial unwrapping of nucleosomes providing transient access to DNA target sites. Pioneers have been found to exhibit differences in their preferential engagement with certain regions of nucleosomes, in particular at: the dyad, where the single DNA gyre is anticipated to be more accessible than elsewhere within the nucleosome where there are two DNA gyres; the ends, where the DNA may spontaneously unwrap from the histone octamer, thus, providing transient access to DNA target sites; internal positions of nucleosomes through DNA distortion; or positions spaced with approximately 10-bp periodicity, where TF binding sites in the major groove of the DNA face outward. While some TFs may target different recognition sequences on nucleosomes than on free DNA, such differences do not explain differences among TFs in their positional preferences of binding to nucleosomes. Numerous biochemical studies of TF binding to nucleosomes have used nucleosomes assembled on synthetic DNA sequences selected for high affinity for the histone octamer, in particular those based on the Widom 601 (W601) template. A recent large-scale in vitro selection (“NCAP-SELEX”) survey of extended DNA binding domains of 220 human TFs classified them according to their positional preferences of binding to nucleosomes built on completely randomized DNA sequence. However, it remains unclear whether results from binding to purely synthetic nucleosomal DNAs generalize to binding to nucleosomes assembled on genomic DNA sequences. For example, nucleosome N1 within the ALB enhancer (ALBN1), which is targeted in vivo by the pioneer factor FOXA during liver development, exhibits FOX-specific sites in close proximity (<15 bp) to the dyad; in contrast, results from the NCAP-SELEX survey found FOX TFs to be end and periodic binders. As another example, the CX3 chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) nucleosome, which is pioneered by PU.1 and CEBPA TFs to promote macrophage identity, contains their binding motifs near the expected dyad and is bound by them when assembled in vitro into either mononucleosomes or compacted nucleosome arrays. In contrast, CEBPB, a close paralog of CEBPA, exhibited strong end-binding preference in the NCAP-SELEX survey. As yet another example, a nucleosome from the LIN28B distal enhancer, which is pioneered in vivo by SOX2 and OCT4 during reprogramming, was bound by both SOX2 and OCT4 in vitro, whereas no or weak binding by SOX2 or OCT4, respectively, was detected on W601-based nucleosomes carrying their binding motifs at multiple positions. Moreover, the structures of OCT4 bound to W601 versus LIN28B nucleosomes differ considerably: OCT4 binds at the entry-exit sites on W601 nucleosomes using exclusively its POU DNA binding domain (DBD), while on LIN28B nucleosomes (as well on nucleosomes based on the nMATN1 genomic locus) it binds using both the HD and POU DBDs on the linker DNA, which is spatially proximal to the dyad, and also using the activation domain, which interacts with the histone H3 and H4 N-terminal tails. A cryo-EM study of a nucleosome containing the ALBN1 enhancer DNA sequence found that the histones were more weakly associated with that DNA than in a nucleosome containing W601 template, suggesting that different DNA sequences may have different accessibility to DNA binding proteins. Synthetic DNA sequences preferentially bound by the histone octamer display 10-bp periodicity in single nucleotides and dinucleotides, in agreement with that found in nucleosome positioning sequences in eukaryotic genomes. These periodic oligonucleotide signals facilitate DNA sequence bending at precise positions around the histone octamer, thus inducing the formation of stable nucleosomes. A single-molecule study found that the unwrapping of one DNA end of a W601-based nucleosome can stabilize the other end, suggesting that differences in DNA composition across nucleosomes might result in differential access to the ends of nucleosomes. Furthermore, results from several in vivo studies indicate that pioneers bind in vivo to only a minority of the genomic sites encompassing their recognition motifs. Altogether, these results raise the possibility that the DNA sequence context of nucleosomes may control the utilization of TF binding sites by pioneers. To address this question, we developed PIONEAR-seq technology and used it to characterize binding by 7 human pioneer TFs to nucleosomes based on W601 versus three genomic sequences, each of which we tiled with random DNA segments. This approach provides a platform to interrogate the sequence context features that regulate TF binding to nucleosomes. RESULTS. PIONEAR-SEQ ASSAY DESIGN. To determine the effects of nucleosome DNA composition on the sequence specificity and positional preferences of pioneer binding, we developed PIONEAR-seq (Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Elements After Reconstitution followed by sequencing) for highly parallel analysis of the nucleosomal DNA binding preferences of TFs (Fig. 1a). Briefly, in PIONEAR-Seq, we tiled across 147-bp nucleosome positioning sequences (‘templates’) every 3 bp with 20-bp random regions (N20 tiles) (‘PIONEAR-seq design of the Input Library’ in Supplementary Information).

Pepper seed protein isolate (PSPI) is a valuable plant-based protein source, yet the impact of processing methods such as high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on its properties remains unclear. The impact of HHP on the structural and functional properties of PSPI at pH 7 and pH 9 was evaluated. Structural changes in PSPI were analyzed using spectral techniques, revealing significant alterations in the secondary and tertiary structures induced by HHP treatment. HHP treatment caused the unfolding of the PSPI structure, leading to the exposure of previously hidden chromophores and hydrophobic groups. The treatment also led to changes in free sulfhydryl groups and increased average particle size suggesting the formation of macromolecular polymers or insoluble aggregates. Consequently, the water-holding capacity, oil-holding capacity, foaming characteristics, and emulsifying activity index of the modified PSPI were significantly enhanced both at pH 7 and pH 9, with maximum improvements of 121.98 %, 157.29 %, 100.00 %, and 265.78 %, respectively.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were utilized for refining the model, capturing complex spatial features and improving decoy refinement. The predicted 3D structure of Zein protein showed a high-confidence score, i.e. C-score of 0.96.

39569632,"Structure and Stabilities of Solution and Gas Phase Protein Complexes. INTRODUCTION. Structures, stabilities, and dynamics of proteins and protein complexes are influenced by interactions with other molecules, and water is an especially important participant in these folding and restructuring processes. Moreover, many of the effects on protein folding and restructuring reactions that are attributed to cofactor, osmolytes, and ligand binding are in fact direct effects of changes in hydration of the protein. Collectively, the effects of noncovalent interactions and hydration modulate the protein folding landscape by altering the contributions of enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (TΔS) to the energy folding landscape. Hydration stabilizes proteins by forming hydrogen bonds with polar amino acids on the protein surface, and temperature has direct influence on the dynamics of water that can promote restructuring processes, especially under cold and hot conditions. The combined effects of hydration and temperature on protein folding and restructuring are noteworthy, with the hydration of biomolecules being largely entropically driven. In the case of large, polar biomolecules, limited here to proteins and protein complexes, multiple low energy conformational states are possible, which is best illustrated by the “rugged energy landscape” (REL) (see Figure 1). The REL harbors rich conformational entropy (conformation states) in which kinetic or thermodynamic traps are present for “non-native” states (microstates) that may be “hidden” from experimental approaches that report ensemble averaged data, viz., isothermal titration calorimetry, X-ray crystallography, and cryo-electron spectroscopy. Understanding the roles and mapping the conformational entropy of the REL are important when considering that these native-like and non-native protein states may underly the aberrant behavior that may lead to malfunction and even disease. There is a growing realization that electrospray ionization combined with ion mobility-mass spectrometry (ESI-IM-MS) has unique potential to provide more complete mapping of the protein REL, viz. effects of solution temperature, pH, ionic strength, presence/absence of cofactors/osmolytes and solvent on protein structure, stabilities, and dynamics. When combined with nano-ESI (nESI), which provides rapid cooling (130–150 K) of protein-containing nanodroplets described as “freeze-dried biomolecules”, IM-MS allows analysis of the kinetically trapped conformers present that make up the REL. Combining nESI with IM-MS affords measurements of mass-to-charge ratios, average charge state (Zavg), and size-to-charge ratios (collision cross section, CCS) of the ions. Moreover, variable-temperature with IM-MS (vT-ESI-IM-MS) otherwise known as temperature induced unfolding (TIU), can determine the effects of solution temperature within the ESI emitter (from ∼2–98 °C) on Zavg, ion abundances, and changes in CCS of reactants and products. Continued development of techniques such as TIU, may allow for greater insight into solution phase dynamics of biomolecules such as the ones in this work. Native mass spectrometry (nMS) studies comparing solution and gas phase ions have a rich history; however, the importance of the stabilization effects of water in solution and the transition of ions from solution to the gas phase is less understood. Collision-induced unfolding (CIU) is used to compare stabilities of gas phase ions (intact proteins and protein complexes) by measuring changes of the CCS as the collisional activation energies are increased. CIU of gas phase ions is primarily an enthalpically driven process, whereas vT-ESI (cold and hot) reports on conformational changes that are induced by changes in temperature and hydration, both of which can be from enthalpy and entropy driven processes. As a general rule, cold temperatures promote the formation of compact ions, whereas higher temperatures favor extended conformers. An exception is the phenomenon of cold unfolding, in which the increased hydration of hydrophobic residues promotes formation of extended conformers. CIU of the gas phase ions can be directly monitored with IM-MS by monitoring changes in the CCS of the ions. Conformational changes induced by changes in solution temperature can also be determined by IM-MS, but oftentimes changes in CCS are too small to be detected; see REL (Figure 1) and note that the activation energies for transitioning among the available states lie well below that for escaping the population of native-like states. Temperature-induced conformational changes may result in changes of the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) which can be detected by changes in Zavg, thereby revealing the presence of microstates (viz. REL) within the native and native-like states.. The results of this study further illustrate the complementary information obtained using CIU and TIU, and may yield new strategies for better understanding the linkage between structures of solution and gas phase ions.

39596038,"Biophysical Analysis of Vip3Aa Toxin Mutants Before and After Activation. 1. INTRODUCTION. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is an aerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive bacterium that is commonly found in soil, insect hosts, plants, and aquatic environments [1]. Bt produces highly potent insecticidal proteins through its various growth phases. The best known are crystal (Cry) and cytolytic (Cyt) toxins, together referred to as δ-endotoxins, synthesized during sporulation. These toxins confer pathogenicity against larvae of diverse insect orders, including Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera, as well as nematodes [2,3]. In fact, Cry toxins are the most common ingredient in commercial Bt-based biopesticides, employed in agriculture as an alternative to chemical insecticides [4]. However, repeated exposure to Cry proteins leads to resistance [5,6,7,8], prompting the search for alternatives [9]. Some Bt isolates can also produce other toxins that, in contrast to δ-endotoxins, are secreted into the growth medium during vegetative growth, such as the vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vip) [10,11]. Vip proteins are classified into three groups: Vpa, Vpb, and Vip [11]. Within Vip toxins, Vip3 is the largest group. Vip3 members share no structural or sequence similarities with Cry proteins. Despite of this, they are also effective against species of Lepidoptera [10] although targeting different binding sites. Thus, they can potentially complement Cry toxins in resistance management and crop protection. Indeed, a synergistic effect has been observed in laboratory experiments [12,13,14,15]; therefore, Vip3 toxins are regarded as a new generation of insecticidal proteins [9]. Co-administration of Vip3 and Cry toxins is available in Bt-based biopesticides, pyramided Bt crops [16,17,18,19] (although cultivation of Bt crops is still banned in many countries [20]), nanoparticles, and as microencapsules in bacterial cells [21,22]. Vip3 proteins have a molecular mass of about 90 kDa and are released as tetrameric soluble inactive protoxins (~360 kDa) in a solution [23]. To become active, Vip3 protoxins need to be proteolytically digested by trypsin or by insect gut proteases to produce two fragments of about 65 kDa and 20 kDa that remain associated in the solution [23,24,25]. After binding to receptors in the brush border of columnar cells, Vip3 proteins exert insecticidal activity through pore-forming activity and apoptosis induction [13,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. The structure of Vip3 proteins has been obtained recently [33,34,35]. In particular, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (SP-cryo-EM) has produced structures of both rounder protoxin and more elongated activated toxin [33,34], which therefore may display different sedimentation coefficients despite having the same molecular weight. Vip3 is divided based on sequence homology into subfamilies such as Vip3A, Vip3B, and Vip3C. Vip3A is the most studied and widely used in pest control, especially in genetically modified crops like Bt corn and Bt cotton. In turn, Vip3A comprises several subtypes, such as Vip3Aa, Vip3Ab, and Vip3Ac, with up to 95% sequence identity. Among these, Vip3Aa is well studied and is very toxic against pests like fall armyworms and cotton bollworms. In Vip3Aa [34], the five structural domains (I–V) of protoxin assemble into a pyramid-shaped tetramer as a dimer of dimers, mainly via domains I and II. After activation, the α-helices in domain I transition from being part of a spring-loaded N-terminal apex to an extended four-helix coiled coil which presumably interacts with the target membrane via its N-terminal amphipathic helix, α1 [33]. In this activated form, the four monomers adopt an identical conformation and are arranged around a four-fold symmetry axis [33,34]. In Vip3Aa, the cleavage site for activation is at residue K198 [36], between domains I and II, although other alternative cleavage sites have been suggested [37]. The structure of Vip3Bc1 has similar characteristics [33], and in this case the interaction of the activated toxin with the membrane was directly observed by electron tomography. The second and third helices of domain I form an antiparallel bundle that adopts a different conformation in the two ‘outer’ and two ‘inner’ monomers. Domain II (residues 200–325) is composed of five α helices and plays a structural role, stabilizing the Vip3 oligomer. Domain III interacts and clamps the most N-terminal segment of the protein (residues 14–23) against the core of the tetramer, whereas domains IV and V likely bind carbohydrates and are not required for oligomer formation [33,34,35], but are necessary for in vivo toxicity [37,38]. Although Vip3 proteins are highly effective at killing lepidopteran pests, commercial development is limited due to their low thermal stability. Since they are secreted in a soluble form, they are easily denatured in the field, retaining activity for only one month at 37 °C [39]. Therefore, in the present study, we have sought to enhance Vip3Aa thermal stability and shelf life by replacing amino acids that may affect intra- and inter-monomeric interactions in domains I and II. The selection of mutated residues was based on their perceived importance for structural stability, as suggested for Vip3Aa [34]. For example, T167 (domain I) may generate a network of inter-monomeric interactions in the core of both C2-symmetric protoxin (Figure 1D) and C4-symmetric activated toxin [34]. F229 (domain II) interacts with residues in the central part of the domain I α4 helix of the neighboring monomer, forming a hydrophobic pocket that appears to keep α4 attached to the core of the tetramer upon needle formation [34]. Finally, E168 (domain I) and N242 (domain II) may form intra-monomeric interactions to stabilize both domains I and II during protein remodeling. All of these residues, except residue 229, were changed to Cys. In the case of a double mutant formed by E168 and N242, formation of a disulfide bond was expected that would produce a more stable toxin. The",PMC,neg,0,neg,7039,neg_PMC,0.9455002,1
39599325,"Heat Shock Factor HSFA6b Mediates Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response in Arabidopsis thaliana. 1. INTRODUCTION. Mitochondria are important organelles in eukaryotes and are involved in various metabolic processes. As the energy factory of cells, mitochondria produce a large amount of ATP as the main energy source for all life activities [1]. During the process of energy conversion, mitochondrial dysfunction, caused by drastic changes in the external environment, destroys the folding and assembly of mitochondrial proteins and induces mitochondrial proteotoxic stress [2]. Under mitochondrial protein toxicity stress, mitochondria communicate with the nucleus through specific signaling molecules. This triggers an increase in the transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial chaperones and proteases, which help maintain mitochondrial protein homeostasis. This protective stress response within the cell is known as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) [3,4,5,6]. UPRmt is a key component of mitochondrial retrograde signaling, activated by various types of mitochondrial dysfunction, including imbalances in the protein quality control system, accumulation of unfolded proteins, and disruptions in the electron transport chain. Its primary function is to reduce the accumulation of unfolded proteins in mitochondria and ensure mitochondrial protein homeostasis [7,8,9]. In addition, UPRmt is involved in monitoring mitochondrial dysfunction and regulating the chromatin structure and gene transcription [10]. Research on the UPRmt mechanism has mainly focused on yeast, nematodes, and mammalian cells, with relatively few studies exploring the mechanism in plants [9]. In our previous research, we demonstrated the existence of a conserved UPRmt in plants and found that they regulate molecular chaperones, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs), mainly through reactive oxygen species and hormone signals to maintain mitochondrial protein homeostasis, which has a significant impact on plant growth and development [5]. However, the specific molecular regulatory mechanisms need to be further studied. In C. elegans, UPRmt is regulated by the transcription factors ATFS-1, DVE-1, UBL-5, the protease ClpP, and the ABC transporter HAF-1 in different ways. Under normal conditions, ATFS-1 is located in mitochondria and degraded by mitochondrial protease Lon. When mitochondrial protein stress occurs, the abundance of ATFS-1 in the cytoplasm increases and then transfers to the nucleus to activate the expression of mitochondrial molecular chaperones, proteases, and other mtPQC-related genes to restore mitochondrial function [11]. In mammals, UPRmt restores mitochondrial protein homeostasis by the transcription factors CHOP and ATF5, which regulate downstream mtPQC-related gene expression. ATF5 showed a similar regulatory mechanism to ATFS-1 in regulating UPRmt activity [12]. In addition to maintaining mitochondrial protein homeostasis, UPRmt is also involved in the monitoring of mitochondrial dysfunction, signal communication between mitochondria and the nucleus, and regulation of the chromatin structure and gene transcription [13]. At the ontogenetic level, UPRmt is involved in the regulation of the life cycle and is closely related to the aging process of organisms [14]. Compared with the key regulatory genes of the UPRmt signaling pathway, such as ATFS-1, DVE-1, and UBL-5, which have been found in yeast and animals [8,15,16], no ATFS-1 homologous genes were found in the plant genome, suggesting that there may be a relatively specific signaling pathway for UPRmt. Recent studies indicate that the mitochondrial retrograde signaling transcription factor ANAC017 plays a key role in regulating the UPRmt signaling pathway [17]. Additionally, UPRmt signaling activates the ABA pathway, which, through ABA Insensitive 5 (ABI5), enhances the expression of UPRmt genes. More and more UPRmt signaling pathways are gradually being uncovered [18]. Heat stress-induced and constitutively expressed conserved members of the HSP family serve as molecular chaperones, playing an essential role in maintaining and restoring protein homeostasis. Under stress conditions, a reduction in molecular chaperones leads to protein denaturation and impairs the processing of newly synthesized proteins. This cytoplasmic protein stress response activates the transcription of heat shock protein (HSP) genes through the action of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs), which are crucial for preserving cellular protein homeostasis [19,20]. During the heat shock response, HSFs primarily regulate the expression of HSPs by binding to heat shock elements (HSEs; nGAAnnTTCn), thereby activating HSP gene transcription [21]. In contrast to animals, plants have a greater number of HSFs, which function as activators of HSPs—except for HSFB1 and HSFB2b—indicating that plants possess a more complex system for maintaining protein homeostasis [22,23]. During the activation of the UPRmt signaling pathway in plants, mitochondrial-related HSP genes are significantly upregulated, yet the upstream HSF transcription factors responsible for this activation require further investigation and validation [5]. In this study, we identified HSFA6b as a novel signaling molecule in the mitochondrial UPRmt pathway. Under mitochondrial proteotoxic stress conditions, HSFA6b translocates to the nucleus and activates the expression of the mtHSPs gene by binding to their promoter region; the HSFA6b mutation blocked the UPRmt signals to promote root growth and accelerated leaf senescence during development. 2. RESULTS. 2.1. SCREENING OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS IN THE UPRMT SIGNALING PATHWAY. In previous studies of the UPRmt signaling mechanism, it was found that in Arabidopsis with mitochondrial ribosomal protein mutations or chemical interference, the UPRmt signaling pathway is activated, thereby promoting the expression of downstream mtHSPs genes [5]. We selected five HSP genes, HSP60-2, HSP60-3A, HSP60-3B, mtHSC70-1, and mtHSC70-5, as potential candidate reporter genes. Pre-experime",PMC,neg,0,neg,7042,neg_PMC,0.0036642202,0
39604265,"Geminivirus βV1 protein activates bZIP17/28-mediated UPR signaling to facilitate viral pathogenicity but its activity is attenuated by autophagic degradation in plants. INTRODUCTION. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a vital organelle responsible for protein folding, protein modification, and secretory processes in eukaryotic cells. Unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate within the ER lumen when the demand for protein synthesis exceeds the capacity of the ER, leading to dysfunction and abnormal morphology of this organelle. This state is commonly referred to as ER stress (Hetz, 2012; Deng et al., 2013; Howell, 2013; Kørner et al., 2015). To restore protein synthesis homeostasis and address ER dysfunction, cells activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), which enhances protein folding by upregulating genes involved in protein folding and secretion or eliminates misfolded proteins through ER-associated degradation (ERAD). ERAD primarily consists of two pathways: ubiquitin proteasome-dependent ERAD and autophagy-lysosome-dependent ERAD (Todd et al., 2008; Wan and Jiang, 2016; Hetz et al., 2020). If protein synthesis cannot be reestablished, the cell initiates programmed cell death (Yang et al., 2014; Srivastava et al., 2018; Simoni et al., 2022). Two branches of the UPR signaling pathway have been identified in plants. One branch is mediated by the ER membrane-resident protein INOSITOL-REQUIRING ENZYME-1 (IRE1) (Koizumi et al., 2001; Deng et al., 2011). Upon sensing the presence of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, IRE1 oligomerizes and activates its endonuclease activity (Bertolotti et al., 2000; Aragón et al., 2009; Korennykh et al., 2009). In Arabidopsis thaliana, activated AtIRE1 selectively recognizes and excises a 23-bp segment of basic leucine zipper 60 (AtbZIP60) mRNA, giving rise to a mature mRNA that encodes the bZIP60-spliced protein (AtbZIP60s), which functions as an active bZIP transcription factor (Deng et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015). AtbZIP60s then translocates into the cell nucleus and activates the transcription of UPR-related genes (Iwata et al., 2008). In addition to the cytoplasmic splicing of mRNAs for transcription factors, Arabidopsis IRE1 also mediates the degradation of mRNAs encoding proteins in the secretory pathway, a process referred to as regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) (Mishiba et al., 2013). The other branch is mediated by bZIP17 and bZIP28 (Liu et al., 2007a, 2007b). Under normal conditions, bZIP17/bZIP28 reside in the ER membrane and bind to the ER-resident chaperone binding protein (BiP) (Srivastava et al., 2013, 2014). In response to stress, bZIP17/28 are released from BiP and translocated to the Golgi apparatus, where they are cleaved by two serine proteinases, site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P). The cytosol-facing domain of the protein is then translocated to the cell nucleus to upregulate the expression of UPR genes (Liu et al., 2007a, 2007b; Zhou et al., 2015). Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular process that relies on the vacuole/lysosome for degradation of dysfunctional proteins and organelles (Liu and Bassham, 2012; Michaeli et al., 2016). In general, the process of autophagy begins with biogenesis of the phagophore, which is followed by formation of the double-membraned vesicles known as autophagosomes (Lamb et al., 2013; Zhuang et al., 2017; Soto-Burgos et al., 2018). Subsequently, the autophagosomes fuse with vacuoles, enabling delivery of their cargo for degradation by acid hydrolases (Toyooka et al., 2006; Barz et al., 2020). Numerous studies have provided evidence for a correlation between autophagy and ER stress (Rashid et al., 2015). Induction of autophagosome formation can be detected during ER-stress conditions (Yorimitsu et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2016; Naumann et al., 2019). In response to ER stress, the accumulated unfolded or misfolded proteins, along with partially damaged ER structures, are sequestered within autophagosomes for degradation, a process termed ER-phagy (Bernales et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2019). These findings demonstrate that autophagy functions as an efficient compensatory mechanism to restore ER homeostasis. Notably, ER-stress-induced autophagy in A. thaliana relies on the ER-stress sensor IRE1b and the core autophagy component ATG18a (Liu et al., 2012; Bao et al., 2018; Aroca et al., 2021). In plant cells, the UPR machinery is activated in conjunction with early defense signaling upon pathogen invasion (Todd et al., 2008; Gayral et al., 2020; Verchot and Pajerowska-Mukhtar, 2021). However, accumulating evidence suggests that certain plant viruses possess the ability to manipulate specific branches of the UPR to facilitate infection. For instance, the triple gene block 3 (TGB3) protein of potato virus X (PVX) has been shown to induce upregulation of bZIP60 in A. thaliana and N. benthamiana, thereby promoting PVX infection (Ye et al., 2011). The βC1 protein of tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) can “fine-tune” the expression of bZIP60-regulated genes, creating an optimal environment for infection (Zhang et al., 2023). In N. benthamiana, the NSvc2 and NSvc4 proteins of rice stripe virus (RSV) selectively activate the bZIP17/28 branch to enhance virus infection (Li et al., 2022a, 2022b). In addition, for certain viruses, dysfunction in key components of ER stress or the UPR leads to reduced infection performance, highlighting the importance of specific UPR features for successful viral infection (Ye et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015, 2023; Li et al., 2022a, 2022b). Begomoviruses, which belong to the family Geminiviridae, are single-stranded DNA viruses that infect a broad range of agronomic and horticultural crops, resulting in significant global yield losses (Hanley-Bowdoin et al., 2013; Li et al., 2022a, 2022b). Betasatellites are extra viral DNA components that frequently accompany begomovirus infection. Betasatellites rely on their associated viruses for replication and encapsidation within host plants; in turn, they can enhance virus pathogenicity and accumulation (Zhou, 2013; Yang et al., 2019).

39608747,"Unveiling a novel signalling pathway involving NRF2 and PGAM5 in regulating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response in stressed cardiomyocytes. The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is a conserved signalling pathway that initiates a specific transcriptional programme to maintain mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis under stress. Previous studies have demonstrated that UPRmt activation has protective effects in the pressure-overloaded human heart, suggesting that robust UPRmt stimulation could serve as an intervention strategy for cardiovascular diseases. However, the precise mechanisms of UPRmt regulation remain unclear. In this study, we present evidence that the NRF2 transcription factor is involved in UPRmt activation in cardiomyocytes during conditions of mitochondrial stress. Silencing NRF2 partially reduces UPRmt activation, highlighting its essential role in this pathway. However, constitutive activation of NRF2 via inhibition of its cytosolic regulator KEAP1 does not increase levels of UPRmt activation markers, suggesting an alternative regulatory mechanism independent of the canonical KEAP1-NRF2 axis. Further analysis revealed that NRF2 likely affects UPRmt activation through its interaction with PGAM5 at the mitochondrial membrane. Disruption of PGAM5 in cardiomyocytes subjected to mitochondrial stress reduces the interaction between PGAM5 and NRF2, enhancing nuclear translocation of NRF2 and significantly upregulating the UPRmt in an NRF2-dependent manner. This NRF2-regulated UPRmt amplification improves mitochondrial respiration, reflecting an enhanced capacity for cardiomyocytes to meet elevated energetic demands during mitochondrial stress. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the NRF2-PGAM5-KEAP1 signalling complex to amplify the UPRmt in cardiomyocytes for cardiovascular and other diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Future studies should aim to elucidate the mechanisms via which NRF2 enhances the protective effects of UPRmt, thereby contributing to more targeted therapeutic approaches.",MEDLINE,neg,0,neg,7051,neg_MEDLINE,0.0033831915,0
39609442,"mdCATH: A Large-Scale MD Dataset for Data-Driven Computational Biophysics. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY. Proteins, the building blocks of life, are central to nearly all biological processes, and understanding their structure and dynamics is crucial for advancements in fields ranging from biochemistry to pharmaceuticals. The convergence of advanced computational methods and biophysical techniques has led to unprecedented insights into molecular structures and functions of proteins. Molecular dynamics (MD), for example, is a compute-intensive technique that attempts to model the dynamics of biological macromolecules in realistic environments, often at all-atom resolution, based on empirical force-fields whose quality has been improving over decades. Machine learning, especially through the development of neural network potentials (NNPs), has the potential to further enhance computational protein research by enabling more accurate predictions and simulations of behaviors. However, the lack of comprehensive datasets capturing the dynamic behaviors of proteins remains a significant challenge. Such datasets are vital for training machine learning models that can predict protein folding, functions, and interactions — often dynamic and transient processes, yet critical for understanding how macromolecules work, interact, and how they might be targeted. High-quality datasets are thus pivotal in advancing our comprehension of these complex phenomena. In recent years, efforts have been made to provide MD datasets, especially for key targets in drug discovery. Notable databases include GPCRmd, a platform dedicated to the study of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) dynamics, and SCOV2-MD as well as BioExcel-CV19, both showcasing the power of collaborative MD databases in the context of COVID-19 research. However, these initiatives are limited by their focus on specific proteome subsets, leaving a gap in comprehensive proteome-wide dynamic datasets. Previous projects such as MoDEL, Dynameomics and ATLAS, and the MDDB and MDRepo initiatives have been introduced to provide dynamics datasets encompassing a broader range of proteins, often in a single replica and at room temperature, but the computational cost of MD has generally limited databases in terms of coverage breadth and timescales. Here, we introduce mdCATH, a dataset focused on providing extensive all-atom MD-derived dynamics for most protein domains in the CATH classification system. mdCATH features simulations of 5,398 domains at five different temperatures, each in five replicas, therefore offering statistically relevant large-scale insights into protein structure dynamics under a multiplicity of conditions. This extensive and homogeneously-collected dataset of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations fills a critical void in the available molecular datasets by offering a rich, diverse, and physiologically relevant array of protein domain dynamics, enabling systematic, proteome-wide studies into protein thermodynamics, folding, and kinetics. It is possible to exploit mdCATH for learning data-driven (e.g. neural network-based) potentials, also thanks to the inclusion, unique to our knowledge, of instantaneous forces derived from a state-of-the-art all-atom force field. We hope that the mdCATH dataset will facilitate improvements in the design and refinement of biomolecular force fields. DATASET REQUIREMENTS. Our goal is to take a step forward in creating a proteome-wide molecular dynamics dataset for advancing drug discovery and enabling researchers to explore the dynamic behaviors of diverse protein targets. We built the mdCATH dataset to meet the following design features:. - Comprehensive coverage of structural features. mdCATH provides molecular dynamics information across 5,398 protein domains from the CATH classification system. This extensive coverage ensures a broad representation of the proteome, making the dataset valuable for a wide range of research applications in drug discovery. - MD-derived coordinates and forces. The dataset includes both coordinates and forces from simulated trajectories. The presence of forces is a unique feature in this dataset, which enables training force-based machine learning potentials. - Wide conformational space sampling. mdCATH features multiple replicas at different temperatures, capturing a variety of conformations, including higher energy states encountered in molecular dynamics simulations. This ensures that the potential functions trained on this dataset produce accurate results across all relevant conformations. - High quality data. To ensure the highest accuracy, mdCATH utilizes state-of-the-art force fields, code, and computational resources. The accuracy of the dataset directly impacts the performance of models trained on it, making the use of the most accurate level of theory practical a priority. - Derived metadata. The dataset includes pre-computed information such as root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), secondary structure composition, and so on. - Reproducibility. Reproducibility is ensured by including the PDB and PSF files in the dataset. Additionally, the data is stored in the efficient HDF5 binary data format, facilitating easy access and manipulation of the dataset for further research and model training. METHODS. We built the dataset on the basis of the domain definitions provided by the CATH database. CATH, a publicly available resource maintained by the Orengo group, provides a set of domains clustered by general architecture according to the class, architecture, topology, and homologous superfamily hierarchy. We started from 14,433 non-homologous domains at the S20 (20%) homology level in CATH release 4.2.0. We then restricted the selection to the subset of 13,470 domains between 50 and 500 amino acids, to focus on globular structures.

39616238,"A van der Waals porous crystal featuring conformational flexibility and permanent porosity for ultrafast water release. INTRODUCTION. Historically, porous crystals with structural flexibility have been a challenging target to synthesize because the flexible molecules transform and translocate readily in the crystal to fill the pores. In the early 2000’s, researchers found that flexible porous crystals can be synthesized by introducing a intermolecular bonding network together with flexible linkers and deformable nodes. The intermolecular bonding network with sufficient bonding strength makes the porous framework robust and tolerant against the evacuation of the guest molecules, as exemplified by metal-organic, covalent organic and hydrogen-bonded frameworks (MOFs, COFs and HOFs), while the flexible components enable the transformation of the lattice in response to the uptake or release of guest molecules. Even when the transformation is significant, the original porous structure can be retrieved just by exposing the polymorph to an appropriate vapor because the bonding network ensures that the constituent molecules hold their arrangement and connectivity in the guest-free state and prevents from collapsing into a polymorph with a totally distinct packing regime. Porous van der Waals crystals are one of the most fragile classes of porous materials sustained thoroughly by van der Waals contacts and have been beyond the scope of crystal engineering because the conventional bonding network strategy based on strong intermolecular interactions is unapplicable. Typically, a van der Waals porous crystal holds its porous framework merely by interdigitation and steric fitting that freezes the conformational and translocational motions of the constituent molecules and prevents the porous architecture from collapsing. Such delicate and intricate molecular packing is hardly designable in general, even with the latest crystal engineering technique, leading to the very small number of compounds known so far. Incorporating flexibility into van der Waals porous crystals, namely, the synthesis of van der Waals crystals with flexible and permanent pores, is an even more formidable challenge and has never been achieved so far. Actually, it is well-known that even a slight change in the conformation results in the transition into a non-porous polymorph, which never turns back into the original porous structure unless it is recrystallized from a solution state or fueled with an appropriate stimulus. Here we report a van der Waals porous crystal featuring conformational flexibility as well as the permanent porosity (Fig. 1a, b). The van der Waals porous crystal (VPC-1) was assembled from a fully aromatic dendrimer G2DBPHZ consisting of a dibenzo[a,j]phenazine (DBPHZ) core and a pair of second-generation carbazole (Cz) dendrons (Fig. 1c). Electron diffraction structure analysis disclosed the single-crystal structure of VPC-1 unambiguously, in which DBPHZ core stacked on one another thoroughly via van der Waals forces to form one-dimensional pores and Cz dendrons were exposed to the pores. X-ray structure analysis revealed the flexible motion of the Cz dendrons in response to the ambient humidity, while the DBPHZ core maintained its one-dimensional columnar arrangement throughout the transition. We also found that the conformational change, together with the fully aromatic surface of the pores, facilitated the transportation of the water molecules through the pores. Time-dependent change in diffuse reflectance upon photoexcitation with an infrared (IR) laser pulse revealed the ultrafast sorption kinetics of water in VPC-1 with a desorption time constant of 490 μs, which is the fastest among the reported porous crystals. As a demonstration of the fast water sorption kinetics, we set a cellophane film above a stack of powdery VPC-1 and shined a visible light onto the powder so that the crystals were heated photothermally and emitted water vapor. The humidification with VPC-1 was so quick and intense that the film bent upward more significantly than those induced by other authentic porous materials. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. CRYSTAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS OF VPC-1. G2DBPHZ was synthesized according to our previous report and was crystalized to yield VPC-1 by diffusing MeOH vapour into a CHCl3 solution of G2DBPHZ in a sealed glass vial standing at 25 °C in 17 days (Fig. S1). The powdery specimen of VPC-1 appeared single-crystalline in microscopic images, although the grain size was not enough for X-ray single-crystal structure analysis (Fig. S2). Alternatively, we conducted electron diffraction for the crystal structure analysis by using Rigaku XtaLAB Synergy-ED (MicroED) and succeeded in solving the single-crystal structure (Fig. 1, Table S1, and Supplementary Data 1). The crystal belonged to the polar space group of Cm and is solely composed of G2DBPHZ without any guests since the analysis was performed under vacuum in the MicroED (Fig. 1a). G2DBPHZ packed one-dimensionally via π–π interactions in such a way that the central DBPHZ core and the peripheral Cz rings respectively stacked on their own. The π–π stacking was perfectly linear along the a axis without any displacement along the b axis and without any rotational displacement. The columns are packed in parallel with each other in the crystallographic bc plane, forming two types of extrinsic pores. The atomic contacts found between the columns were only H···H, meaning that VPC-1 is a pure van der Waals molecular crystal. The weak intermolecular interactions between the columns are highly beneficial for allowing G2DBPHZ to transform smoothly in response to moderate chemical or physical stimuli. The perfectly linear π–π stacking is generally static and will not be destroyed easily, which is advantageous for preserving the molecular arrangement throughout the flexible motion. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for dimers extracted from the crystal structures along the different directions support that the intercolumnar interactions are very weak compared to π-π interactions (",PMC,neg,0,neg,7053,neg_PMC,0.0019154999,0
39621926,"Shortcuts to flexible structures. While this Commentary “paper” will be distributed primarily electronically, some of us will choose to read it on physical paper. For many centuries, the flexibility, stability, strength, and extreme thinness of paper have made it an essential medium of information exchange, one that has shown surprising endurance into the digital age. These same properties have also rendered it invaluable as a structural material, from the nests of paper wasps to modern sustainable containers for commercial products. Despite paper’s long familiarity, its versatility continues to yield novel applications, as in the new study by Dang, Gonella, and Paulino (1). The authors combine cutting, folding, and gluing to direct paper’s strength and flexibility in new ways, giving rise to a new form of flexible structure they name folded kirigami. Folded kirigami is formed from a single sheet of paper, into which a repeating pattern of cuts and fold lines is placed. From this two-dimensional configuration, the panels are folded along the lines to create a structure of strong, rigid but hollow paper prisms joined via flexible paper hinges. Strikingly, these three-dimensional structures are each formed from a single sheet of paper. These structures differ from conventional solids, which have fixed shapes that can only be deformed via substantial force. A flexible solid structure might be defined as one containing elements of fixed shape that are allowed to move relative to one another, such as the twin blades of scissors, or the bones of the human body. Such structures are relatively rare in the physical universe and may have first proliferated in the Earth’s seas with primitive string-like biomolecules that had fixed backbones that could twist freely into many conformations. Flexibility has since become predominant in the biological world: Single-cell organisms squeeze through gaps, leaves unfurl to capture solar energy, muscles contract, and feathers reposition to soar in the wind. Flexibility emerges, then, not because it is easy to achieve but because it is useful. This principle drives engineered flexible structures, from the aforementioned scissors to sophisticated robots, and from solar panels that, once unfolded, power orbital space missions to stents inserted into the human heart. Folded kirigami is a type of mechanical metamaterial, a recent and powerful paradigm for the production of flexible solids: engineered structures that have repeated geometric motifs (generally periodic unit cells) that imbue them with novel mechanical response (2, 3). Flexible mechanical metamaterials combine simple structure with rich function, and thus hold great promise in arenas inaccessible to traditional manufacturing techniques, such as nanotechnology. There are a number of existing techniques to produce metamaterials and other structures at the smallest scales. Lithography consists of removing material (cutting it away) to achieve a target structure. Additive manufacturing (3D printing) can build up material with nanoscale features. Self-assembly can connect many individual building blocks into much larger structures. However, all of these techniques have certain limitations: Self-assembly can be prone to defects and often forms relatively weak bonds; other techniques don’t always scale well. In general, flexible structures represent a particular challenge for experimental realization. Because flexible structures can exist in any of several configurations nearly degenerate in energy, they can actually deform during their own creation, and constructing an object while it is changing shape is difficult. This is one reason that naturally occurring atomic structures such as crystals are almost never flexible [one notable exception is zeolites, which have a “flexibility window” that endows them with unusual properties (4)]. Flexibility can be understood as a sort of selectivity, the ability to deform more easily into some shapes than into others. Conventional solids are not selective: Deformation into any shape requires substantial energy. Nor are conventional fluids: They can take any shape (at least those preserving volume, in the case of liquids) without the input of energy. In contrast, a thin sheet—whether it consists of paper or more specialized materials—selects for bending over stretching because the energetic cost of stretching is linear in the thickness, whereas the cost of bending is cubic in the thickness. As such, paper has a strong tendency to bend rather than to stretch. However, many flexible metamaterials are based around mechanisms, in which rigid elements such as one-dimensional rods, two-dimensional plates, or three-dimensional polyhedra are joined via flexible hinges such that they may transform their shape by bending the hinges without deforming the rigid elements. The selectivity of the design depends, then, on the ability to achieve highly flexible hinges with highly rigid elements. In the ideal case, only the hinges deform and the other elements remain rigid, selecting entirely for the desired deformation. In the opposite limit, the so-called rigid elements deform as easily as the hinges. One way to address this challenge of selectivity is by using multiple materials and hand-assembling a structure. However, this procedure does not readily scale, and previous techniques have not been able to achieve high selectivity with a structure formed from a single sheet. Consider, in particular, removing material from a sheet, whether it consists of paper or single-atomic layer graphene, to generate a network of solid rectangles joined via thin ligaments (5). In an ideal world, this generates a mechanism, in which the elements counterrotate in order to achieve dilation in the plane rather than bending. In practice, the structure buckles into the third dimension, and the thinner the ligaments, the more quickly they age and tear. Indeed, crumpling into the third dimension radically alters graphene’s bending stiffness,",PMC,neg,0,neg,7057,neg_PMC,0.002074867,0

The structural response of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to changes in the solution environment differs distinctly from that of folded globular proteins (FGPs). Although the FGP increases in size with increasing temperature, the IDP decreases in size. We investigated the temperature-dependent structural and dynamic behaviors of the intrinsically disordered region of the helicase-associated endonuclease for fork-structured DNA as an example of an IDP. We observed not only changes in the secondary and tertiary structures with increasing temperature but also an acceleration of the internal dynamics. The transition temperature at which both structural and dynamic changes were observed was 313–323 K. It was concluded that the dynamical cooperativity between the polyproline II helix and water plays a significant role in temperature-dependent structural behaviors. INTRODUCTION. Proteins that lack an ordered structure (1) are categorized as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). IDPs are distinguished by the prevalence of highly charged residues, whereas folded globular proteins (FGPs) are characterized by a hydrophobic interior and hydrophilic exterior (2). The discrepancy in the residue composition between IDPs and FGPs could cause disparate structural responses to alterations in the solution environment. Consequently, we focused on how IDPs and FGPs respond to temperature changes as a case study of environmental variation. The IDP undergoes a reduction in size with an increase in temperature (3,4,5), whereas the FGP exhibits an increase in size. Although computational approaches have been employed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the reduction in size observed with increasing temperature in IDPs (6,7), a definitive conclusion remains elusive. Further experimental investigations are necessary to improve our understanding of this unique phenomenon. Given that IDPs possess highly flexible structures regulated by internal dynamics (7), it is crucial to investigate their structural and dynamic properties to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of their temperature-dependent structural changes. Experimental techniques capable of detecting structures ranging from the local to higher-order scale can offer key insights into temperature-dependent structural changes in IDPs (2). Lin et al. succeeded in revealing the structure of a highly flexible protein through small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), NMR, and molecular simulation (8), demonstrating the significance of complementary uses of various experimental techniques for the study of a flexible protein. Accordingly, a combination of SAXS/small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), circular dichroism (CD), and NMR was employed to investigate the structural characteristics of the IDP at various temperatures. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the internal dynamics of the IDP, ranging from subnanoseconds to microseconds, has been directly studied using quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) (7,9,10,11,12). In this study, the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of the helicase-associated endonuclease for fork-structured DNA (Hef-IDR) was selected as an example of an IDP. The Hef from Thermococcus kodakaraensis, a hyperthermophilic archaeon (13) (UniProt: Q5JJ98), is composed of an N-terminal helicase domain (residues 1–492), a C-terminal nuclease domain (residues 594–811), and an IDR (residues 493–593) intervening in the two globular domains. The main function of Hef is to repair damaged DNA. Specifically, the helicase and nuclease domains unwind and cleave fork-structured DNA, respectively. In contrast, the IDR interacts with multiple proteins involved in DNA repair and replication. The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of temperature-dependent structural changes in IDPs through integrative analyses obtained by combining the aforementioned techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS. SAMPLES. Hef-IDR was produced in Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells (Agilent). The pET28a plasmid (Novagen) harboring the Hef-IDR gene fragment was modified from that reported previously (13) to remove the histidine tag and TEV protease recognition sequence. The E. coli cells were grown at 310 K in Luria Broth (LB) medium. When the E. coli culture reached an optical density at 660 nm of 0.5, expression of Hef-IDR expression was induced by adding isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mM. After cultivation at 298 K for 18 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell lysate was prepared by sonication in buffer A (50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g, the supernatant was heated at 353 K for 20 min. The heat-resistant fraction was diluted with buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0] and 0.5 mM EDTA) and then applied to a cation exchange column (HiTrap SP HP, Cytiva), which was developed with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.6 M NaCl. The eluted fractions were applied to a gel-filtration column (HiLoad 26/600 Superdex200, Cytiva) which was equilibrated with buffer C (10 mM HEPES-NaOH [pH 7.5], 350 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA). To inactivate contaminating proteases, purified Hef-IDR was heated to 353 K for 10 min, rapidly cooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 193 K. SAXS. The SAXS measurements were conducted using a Photon Factory BL-6A instrument (Tsukuba, Japan). The X-ray wavelength and the sample-to-camera distance were set to 1.5 Å and 2038.9 mm, respectively. PILATUS 1M was used as the detector, and the accessible Q range was from 0.0085 to 0.27 Å−1. The data acquisition time and number of acquisitions were 2 s and 200, respectively. Prior to data reduction, we checked the radius of gyration (Rg) as a function of the frame, and no change in Rg was observed. We then averaged all 200 frames to obtain the scattering profile.

39804501,"Validation of a tele-robotic ultrasound system for abdomen and thyroid gland explorations: a comparison with standard ultrasound. BACKGROUND. There is a global shortage of radiologists due to the imbalance between the number of trained radiologists and the increasing demand of medical imaging in current health practice, with an imperative need for short-term solutions [1]. This problem is aggravated in primary care and rural or remote communities that do not have enough access to a radiologist or sonographer to perform ultrasound (US) examinations, which require physical presence. Tele-medicine has been consolidated as a valuable tool to overcome some of these drawbacks to better allocate medical resources and access to healthcare, widely spread in the radiology community to remotely report computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies [2, 3]. Tele-robotic US is a novel technology that allows radiologists and sonographers to perform US examinations from a distance, which can help overcome the geographic restrictions that some remote and rural communities have [4]. The first models appeared in the late 90’s and beginning of twenty-first century, and in the past two decades some models have been commercialized for clinical use [5]. However, there is still insufficient data to fully adopt this new technology, especially the learning curve for the radiologist or sonographer. The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the performance of a 5G-based tele-robotic US system for abdominal and thyroid gland assessment in a cohort of healthy volunteers and outpatients and to investigate the learning curve of such technique as well as patient satisfaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS. STUDY DESIGN. A prospective unicentric comparative cohort-based study was designed for assessing the reliability of tele-robotic US following the Standards for the Reporting of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) [6]. A total of 64 participants were consecutively included from January 2023 to October 2023. The inclusion criteria were: ≥ 18 years old and healthy volunteers or outpatients without relevant diseases or clinical background. Patients with major diseases such as advanced chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis and cardiopulmonary or neurologic diseases that cause mobility impairment or breathing difficulty were excluded, as well as any other clinical condition that restricts visualization and/or collaboration when performing the US. Outpatients without relevant clinical history and minor medical US requests (such as ruling out cholelithiasis or urolithiasis) were eligible. Participants were recruited during regular shifts. A description of the aim of the study and the methodology was verbally explained to all the eligible participants and were consequently included in the study once the informed consent was signed. The recruitment and US studies were simultaneously done in Hospital Vall Hebron, a university hospital in Barcelona, Spain. For every included participant a two-step process was designed. First, a single abdominal radiologist (radiologist A) with approximately five years of experience in US performed a tele-robotic US of the thyroid gland or abdomen, or both. Posteriorly, in a double-blind manner, a second independent radiologist with experience in abdominal and thyroid US performed the respective standard US. A total of three abdominal radiologists (B, C and D) with different experiences performed the standard US. Radiologist B, with approximately 20 years of experience in US, did most of the standard studies because of better availability. Radiologist C and D had nine years and six years of experience respectively. In outpatients only the requested US was done, either abdominal or thyroid gland. Healthy volunteers were subject to both US unless specified otherwise by the participant. In the latter, a new US request was made in the electronic clinical record of the patient and any relevant finding reported in the standard US was communicated for further assessment. At the end of the process, an electronic survey was given to all participants to evaluate the satisfaction and share opinions between both techniques, discriminating between thyroid and abdominal studies. DATA COLLECTED. For all the participants demographic variables were recorded independently of the US performed: age (years), sex (male/female) and body mass index (BMI, Kg/m2). The medical request for the US in outpatients was also recorded, as well as incidental findings while performing both techniques. Thyroid nodules were described and classified based on the Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) classification [7]. A set of qualitative and quantitative variables were designed to compare both techniques, detailed in table S1 and table S2. Qualitative variables were assessed in all the participants. Quantitative variables were assessed in the last 31 participants since it was when radiologist A was comfortable with managing the robotic arm and hence following the protocol. Left and right hepatic lobe and long/short axis of right and left kidney were also used to establish a retrospective cut-off value (minimum number of explorations) to have proper training in abdominal tele-robotic US. Finally, the time needed for the radiologist to perform the tele-robotic US was also registered for every case. It was defined as the time from the start of the robotic arm movement until it got back to resting position. The items evaluated in the participant survey are graded in a 5-point Likert scale and are as follows: (1) I felt comfortable when being examined by the tele-robotic US; (2) I felt safe when being examined by the tele-robotic US; (3) The communication with the radiologist was fluent when being examined by the tele-robotic US; (4) I got my questions about the procedure answered before being examined by the tele-robotic US; (5) I trust the results obtained with the tele-robotic US; (6) The tele-robotic US is more uncomfortable than the standard US; (7) I felt a higher pressure in the examined zone with the tele-robotic US than with the standard",PMC,far_neg,0,far_neg,7109,far_neg_PMC,0.0022961588,0
3987418,"Children's perceptions of the qualities of sibling relationships. Although many studies of family constellations exist, only recently have investigators begun to examine the qualities of sibling relationships. The purpose of the present investigation was to develop a systematic framework for describing and assessing such relationship qualities. In the first study, upper elementary school children were interviewed about their perceptions of the qualities of their sibling relationships. These interviews yielded a list of 15 salient qualities. In the second study, a self-report questionnaire that assessed their perceptions of these qualities was administered to a sample of 198 fifth- and sixth-grade children. A principal components analysis yielded 4 underlying factors: (a) Warmth/Closeness, (b) Relative Status/Power, (c) Conflict, and (d) Rivalry. Relative Status/Power was found to be strongly related to the relative ages of the child and sibling. The other 3 factors were also related to various family constellation variables, but these relations were modest in size. Because family constellation variables and the qualities of sibling relationships are not isomorphic with one another, it is important to study relationship qualities directly, rather than simply examining family constellation variables. Some of the determinants of such qualities are discussed.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7120,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0029121786,0
39875976,"Neuromuscular monitoring and incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade: a prospective observational study. INTRODUCTION. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are routinely used in anesthesia practice. An undetected, incomplete recovery of neuromuscular function at the end of surgery exposes patients to potential and preventable postoperative adverse respiratory events [1, 2]. To date, real-time measurement of the train-of-four ratio (TOFR) at the level of the adductor pollicis muscle is considered the most appropriate method for neuromuscular assessment in clinical practice. Despite the recognition of quantitative neuromuscular monitoring (NMM) as the only effective measure for avoiding or reducing postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB), the incidence of RNMB due to inadequate NMM is still high [3, 4]. Both the literature and expert opinion have ascribed substandard NMM to the limited availability of monitoring devices in some hospitals and to clinicians’ reluctance, attributable either to the belief that RNMB is a rare event or overconfidence in their ability to qualitatively assess patient’s neuromuscular function recovery [5]. The primary objective of this study was the incidence of RNMB in patients admitted to the recovery room (RR) after the completion of surgeries of any duration involving the use of nondepolarizing intermediate-acting neuromuscular blockers. Residual paralysis was defined as a TOFR ≤ 0.9. The secondary objectives were the number of postoperative adverse respiratory events and for exploratory purposes, the estimation of potential risk factors through logistic regression analysis. METHODS. This observational prospective study adheres to the applicable Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. It was approved by the Territorial Ethics Committee (Comitato Etico Territoriale Lazio Area 3–Roma, ID Number: 5991, Protocol Number 0000494/23, 29/11/2023) and it was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06193213, date of registration: 05/01/2024). Written, informed consent was obtained from all patients before enrolment. The study was conducted between February and May 2024 at Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCSS, Rome, Italy, in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. We included 90 spontaneously breathing adult patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-III, who were admitted to the RR after completion of non-abdominal surgery under general anesthesia having received at least one dose of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent for endotracheal intubation or maintenance of neuromuscular blockade. Patients undergoing emergency surgery, those with neuromuscular pathologies, or those requiring postoperative monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit were excluded from the study. Given the observational nature of the study, anesthesia management was not standardized—dosing of NMBAs, use of NMM, administration of reversal agents, and timing of extubation were all left to the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist, in accordance with its clinical routine. The anesthesiologist in charge in the operating room was unaware that neuromuscular function was going to be monitored in the RR. NMM devices available in every operating theatre are TOFscan® Dräger-Drägerwerk AG & Co. KGaA, Germany or NMT MechanoSensor, GE Healthcare–United States. Within 5 min from arrival in the RR, an independent researcher assessed the contraction of the adductor pollicis using acceleromyography (TOFscan® Dräger-Drägerwerk AG & Co. KGaA, Germany). Two TOFR measurements were performed 30 s apart. The nerve was stimulated with 4 stimuli of 40 mA of amplitude, at a frequency of 2 Hz, each of a duration of 0.2 ms. In analogy with other studies [6, 7], if the difference between the two measurements was ≤ 10%, the average value was considered for the analysis. If the difference was > 10%, a third measurement was taken, and the two closest results were averaged. Those patients presenting with residual blockade were monitored and eventually administered sugammadex to restore normal neuromuscular function, assessed by subsequent TOFR measurements. Data related to the anesthesia performed, including the agents used, whether neuromuscular monitoring was employed, and the timing of administration of neuromuscular blocking drugs and reversal agents, if applicable, were recorded. The duration of stay in the RR along with any adverse respiratory events that occurred in the RR and up until hospital discharge were also documented. Respiratory adverse events were defined as episodes of desaturation (SpO2 < 92%) requiring oxygen supplementation or the detection of atelectasis, pneumonia, or pleural effusion of noncardiac origin found on thoracic imaging tests eventually performed during the hospital stay. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. From a meta-analysis published in 2020 by Carvalho [8], which included 53 studies and a total of 12,664 patients, we extrapolated 22 studies (n = 4268) with population, objectives, and methodology similar to our study. In these studies, regardless of whether an intraoperative monitoring system of neuromuscular function was adopted, the incidence of RNMB (defined as a TOFR ≤ 0.9) after the use of intermediate-acting neuromuscular blockers, detected in the RR using acceleromyography was 28%. Assuming the same incidence of 28%, we estimated that a sample size of 78 patients would be required to estimate the expected proportion with an absolute precision of 10% and a 95% confidence level. Assuming a drop-out of 15%, the sample was increased to 90 patients. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range) for numerical data or N (%) for categorical or ordinal data.

40001502,"State of the Art in the Standardization of Stromal Vascular Fraction Processing. 1. INTRODUCTION. Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) is composed of a heterogeneous population of cells, such as adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), pericytes, and smooth muscle cells [1,2]. Since its first identification in the 60s as a fraction of non-adipocytes cells [3], SVF has been widely characterized and consequently employed in different clinicasl settings mainly due to regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties [4]. The enzymatic isolation of SVF derived from adipose tissue (AT) was first performed in 2006 by Yoshimura and colleagues through tissue incubation with a collagenase solution at 37 °C, followed by several centrifugation and washing steps which allowed the gradient separation of digested tissue in aqueous phase, enriched in SVF cellular components, from waste oil phase [5]. The enzymatic isolation protocol has been greatly improved and standardized over decades, because of the classification of SVF as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) due to the process with substantial manipulation (enzymatic digestion). Once considered as ATMP, SVF must be isolated according to good manufacturing practices (GMP) to ensure the highest sterility and quality of final products during the process. Moreover, the percentage of cell viability and the total number of viable cells (VNCs) per mL detected in each AT were considered as main specifications of the final product, as they reflect the extraction efficiency as well as the quality of the processed sample, anticipating the optimal starting point to trigger the best potential therapeutic effect. Both cell viability percentage and VNCs were demonstrated to be influenced by AT harvesting techniques and different isolation protocols performed through different approaches, i.e., manual, automated, enzymatic, or mechanic [6,7,8,9]. The multicolor flow cytometry analysis was proven to be a powerful technique to discriminate all different cell subpopulations present in the SVF, after the design of specific gating strategies to estimate the distribution of nucleated cells [10,11]. Few works on SVF process standardization have been published in the last 10 years [12,13]; however, the increased sensitivity of ATMPs to be used as drugs and new SVF/ASCs-derived candidate drugs, triggered researchers to develop new strategies to improve the therapeutical and regenerative potential of SVF and SVF-derived products (https://clinicaltrials.gov/, accessed on 9 November 2024) [14]. Indeed, SVF has gained significant interest in regenerative medicine due to the anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and pro-angiogenic properties of mesenchymal components (ASCs) [2,15,16,17]. These features have led to its therapeutic application in various clinical settings. Recent studies reviewed by Goncharov and colleagues [4] highlight the broad potential of SVF in clinical medicine. Notably, SVF has been used in orthopedics to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA), resulting in improved pain management, cartilage regeneration, and mobility [18,19,20]. In reconstructive surgery, SVF-based therapy has been applied in nasal repair and breast reconstruction, offering improved aesthetic outcomes, and expanding treatment options for critical areas [21,22,23]. SVF has also shown promise in early-phase clinical trials for treating myocardial ischemia [24,25]. Additionally, a systematic review by Ferreira et al. [26] revealed that SVF therapy spans a wide range of applications, from cosmetic and aesthetic uses to clinical treatments for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s), autoimmune diseases, infertility, and vocal cord injuries [27,28]. The growing body of evidence on the efficacy and safety of SVF therapy encourages further studies to explore its broader applications. Future research should focus on the reproducibility of results and the development of standardized protocols for isolating SVF. With this aim, our group published, in a collaborative work, a proposal strategy for the standardization of GMP-compliant isolation and analysis processes, performed and validated at two different locations [11]. Standardization of SVF processing still retains several challenges due to physiological variabilities (i.e., patient-specific factors such as age, sex, body mass index, health status), SVF cellular heterogeneity, process variabilities, and the lack of regulatory standards [18,29]. Despite these challenges, several advances have been achieved in the standardization of SVF processing, whereas the development of automated processing systems allowed the reduction of both technical errors and variability in SVF isolation, as well as the matching of several protocols, implying the publication of precise guidelines to minimize variability and enhance reproducibility of the SVF processing across different laboratories. Moreover, crucial advances in flow cytometry and molecular techniques for immunophenotyping allowed an increased resolution to precisely discriminate different cell subpopulations [30,31]. Still, different surgical approaches and facility processing of AT induced several pending questions about the standardization more than two decades after the paper by Zuk in 2001 [2]. Here we discuss different aspects trying to figure out all common denominators of the whole process. 2. METHODS. 2.1. RESEARCH STRATEGY.

40001605,"Sodium-Dependent Conformational Change in Flagellar Stator Protein MotS from Bacillus subtilis. 1. INTRODUCTION. Flagellar motility is important for virulence, competitiveness, and survival for many bacteria. The flagellum consists of a helical filamentous axial structure extending from the cell body and a reversible motor embedded in the cell membrane at the base of the axial structure [1,2]. The axial structure is rotated by the motor powered by electrochemical potential energy across the cell membrane. The motor is composed of a rotor and a dozen stator units surrounding the rotor [3]. The rotor comprises the MS-ring in the cytoplasmic membrane and the C-ring attached beneath the MS-ring. The MS-ring consists of a transmembrane protein, FliF, and acts as an assembly base for the flagellum. The C-ring is made of three cytoplasmic proteins, FliG, FliM, and FliN, and is essential for torque generation by interacting with the stator units. The stator unit is an ion channel that converts the electrochemical potential of a specific ion, such as proton (H+) or sodium ions (Na+), into mechanical rotation. The stator unit consists of two types of membrane proteins (the A- and B-subunits) [4] called MotA and MotB for the H+-driven stator [5], PomA and PomB for the Na+-driven stator from Vibrio species [6], and MotP and MotS for the Na+-driven stator from some Bacillus species [7]. CryoEM structural studies of the stator unit revealed that the stator unit is a hetero-heptameric complex in which the transmembrane helices of the B-subunit dimer penetrate the central hole of the pentameric A-subunit ring [8,9,10,11]. The rotational symmetry mismatch between the A- and B-subunits has led to a model of the flagellar rotation mechanism in which rotation of the A-subunit ring around the B-subunit dimer coupled with specific ion influx drives the rotor rotation by the interaction between the stator A-subunit and rotor protein FliG in the C-ring [8,9,10,11,12]. The A-subunit is made up of four transmembrane helices and a cytoplasmic domain [13], which has conserved charged residues essential for interactions with FliG for torque generation [14,15,16,17]. The B-subunit consists of an N-terminal transmembrane helix that contains an aspartate residue critical for specific ion flux through the stator [6,18,19] and a C-terminal periplasmic region containing an OmpA-like domain that binds to the peptidoglycan (PG) layer through the peptidoglycan binding (PGB) motif and/or the T-ring to anchor the stator unit around the rotor [20,21,22,23] (Figure 1). The transmembrane helix of the B-subunit forms an ion pathway with the transmembrane region of the A-subunits [11,18,24,25] An amphiphilic helix following the transmembrane helix of the B-subunit, namely, the plug, blocks the ion flow before incorporation of the stator into the motor [26,27,28,29]. The stator units dynamically associate with and dissociate from the functioning motor, whereas they are anchored to the PG layer or the T-ring for torque generation [30,31,32]. The ion flow through the stator unit is activated only when the stator unit is installed into the motor [25]. Structural studies of a periplasmic fragment of Salmonella MotB (St-MotBc), which covers the essential periplasmic region for motor function, and a corresponding fragment of Vibrio alginolyticus PomB (Va-PomBc) revealed that they consist of a single core domain with N-terminal long and short α-helices and form a compact dimer [20,21,33]. Because the dimer is too short to reach the PG layer, a conformational rearrangement is expected in the N-terminal helix of the periplasmic region of the B-subunit. An in vivo crosslinking study of Va-PomB indicated that the N-terminal helix adopts a conformational change upon stator incorporation into the motor [20]. Crystallographic and NMR studies of the periplasmic fragment of the St-MotB mutant protein and in vivo crosslinking analysis revealed that the coil–helix transition of the N-terminal helix of St-MotBC occurs to anchor the stator [21]. Bacillus subtilis is a gram-positive bacterium and has two types of stator units: H+-type MotAB (Bs-MotAB) and Na+-type MotPS (Bs-MotPS) [7,34]. The motor driven by Bs-MotAB is dominant under normal swimming conditions, whereas that driven by Bs-MotPS is observed under high pH, high external Na+ concentration, and highly viscous conditions [7,34,35]. Bs-MotPS assembles around the rotor depending on the external Na+ concentration [34]. Bs-MotS consists of 242 amino acids. Residues 21 to 43 form a transmembrane region, and residues 44 to the C-terminus form a periplasmic region. Residues 117 to 238 show sequence similarity to the OmpA-like domain containing the conserved PGB motif (Figure 1 and Figure S1). Recently, based on direct observations of purified Bs-MotPS by high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM), a Na+-dependent structural change in the periplasmic region of Bs-MotS (Bs-MotSc) has been proposed [36]. In the model, Bs-MotSc is unfolded at low Na+ concentrations, but at more than 100 mM NaCl, it folds and forms a dimer that can be anchored to the PG layer. However, the mechanism of the structural change remains unclear, and it is still unclear whether Na+-dependent folding really occurs. Moreover, no high-resolution structure of the periplasmic region of the stator B-subunit of gram-positive bacteria has been reported, although the PG layer of gram-positive bacteria differs considerably from that of gram-negative bacteria in its thickness, structure, and composition. In this study, we determined the structure of MotS68–242, a periplasmic fragment of MotS, at high and low Na+ concentrations and investigated the mechanism of the Na+-dependent structural change using far-UV CD spectroscopy. Our results indicate that the sodium-dependent coil–helix transition occurs in the region connecting the plug and the N-terminal helix of Bs-MotSc. Based on the results, we propose a new model for the sodium-dependent structural change in Bs-MotS that anchors the stator. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 2.1.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy appears to be a promising noninvasive technique to meet this goal. However, the correlation of lenticular ""invasive"" morphological and physiological data with NMR spectroscopic data in organ culture is necessary for establishing the validity of NMR spectral measurements as an index of lens functional integrity.

40189086,"Physiological and behavioural responses of aquatic organisms to microplastics and experimental warming. Microplastics are an emerging contaminant of concern because of their potential to cause harm to aquatic biota, such as reproduction, growth, and survival, and there is a lack of knowledge about how microplastics can affect other sub-lethal responses, such as movement behaviour and respiration rates, which may have consequences for species interactions. Additionally, there is little evidence for the effects of microplastics under different climate warming scenarios. To address this knowledge gap, the effects of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) microplastics, in combination with different constant temperature regimes (10 °C, 15 °C, and 20 °C) and a fluctuating regime (10-20 °C over a 24h diel cycle) on the respiration rates, feeding rates, and movement speeds of Gammarus pulex and Asellus aquaticus were assessed. Respiration rates of G. pulex increased with temperature according to metabolic theory, but there was no evidence for increased respiration rates of A. aquaticus at higher temperatures. Overall, the respiration rates and movement speeds of G. pulex were higher than A. aquaticus but there was no evidence that microplastics independently, or in combination with experimental warming, influenced any of the responses tested.

4208545,"Transplantation of posterior polar plasm in Drosophila. Induction of germ cells at the anterior pole of the egg. In Drosophila melanogaster the primordial germ cells are normally formed at the posterior tip of the egg during the preblastoderm stage. In order to determine whether the posterior polar plasm is capable of inducing the formation of primordial germ cells in another region of the embryo, portions of this cytoplasm were transferred from wild-type embryos of the early cleavage stage to the anterior tip of mwh e embryos of the same age. At various times after the injection (15-200 min), embryos were fixed for histological analysis. Alternating thick and thin sections were examined for the presence of experimentally induced pole cells. In more than half of the embryos analyzed in this way, one to six cells were found containing the polar granules as well as round nuclear structures, both of which are characteristic of normal pole cells and are not present in blastoderm cells. In order to determine whether these ""pole cells"" function normally, i.e., develop further into germ cells, the cells induced at the anterior tip of mwh e blastoderm embryos were introduced into the posterior region of y w sn(3) hosts of the same age. The flies resulting from these embryos were mated to y w sn(3) partners. In addition to the expected y w sn(3) progeny, wild-type flies heterozygous for mwh e and, therefore, descended from the experimentally induced pole cells were found in 4% of the crosses. Such flies did not appear in the control experiments after transfer of normal anterior cells from noninjected blastoderm embryos. These results demonstrate that the posterior polar plasm can be transferred to the anterior tip of the embryo and that in this presumptive somatic region it still retains its capacity to determine the formation of the primordial germ cells.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7174,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0059340666,0

Specific cDNA probes of Moloney and AKR murine leukemia viruses have been prepared to characterize the proviral integration sites of these viruses in the genomes of Balb/Mo and Balb/c mice. The genetically transmitted Moloney provirus of Balb/Mo mice was detected in a characteristic Eco RI DNA fragment of 16 x 10(6) daltons. No fragment of this size was detected in tissue DNAs from Balb/c mice infected as newborns with Moloney virus. We conclude that a viral integration site, occupied in preimplantation mouse embryos, is not necessarily occupied when virus infects cells in post-natal animals. Balb/Mo and Balb/c mice do carry the AkR structural gene in an Eco RI DNA fragment of 12 x 10(6) daltons. Further restriction analysis of this fragment indicated that both mouse lines carry one AKR-type provirus. Leukemogenesis in Balb/Mo and newborn infected Balb/c mice is accompanied by reintegration of Moloney viral sequences in new chromosomal sites of tumor tissues. Part of the reintegrated Moloney viral sequences are of subgenomic size. The AKR viral sequences, however, are not found in new sites. Further restriction analysis revealed that the development of Moloney virus-induced leukemia in Balb/Mo mice does not lead to detectable structural alteration of the genetically transmitted Moloney and AKR structural genes.

6309262,"Saturation transfer EPR spectroscopy on spin-labeled muscle fibers using a loop-gap resonator. Previously, saturation transfer (ST-EPR) studies of biomolecular dynamics have involved the use of a resonant cavity and the V'2 display (absorption, second harmonic, out of phase). In the present study, we replaced the resonant cavity with a loop-gap resonator and used the U'1 display (dispersion, first harmonic, out of phase) to study spin-labeled muscle fibers. The new resonator and display showed several advantages over those previously used. It produced virtually noiseless U'1 spectra on a 0.4 microliter sample using a 4 min scan; previous U'1 experiments on spin-labeled muscle, using a conventional rectangular cavity, resulted in an unacceptably low signal-to-noise ratio. The high filling factor of the resonator facilitated the study of these extremely small fiber bundles and permitted high microwave field intensities to be achieved at much lower incident microwave power levels, thus greatly enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio in U'1 experiments. This reduction in the noise level made it possible to benefit from the other advantages of U'1 over V'2, such as stronger signals, simpler line shapes, and simpler data analysis. For these muscle fiber samples, the resulting sensitivity (signal/noise/sample volume) of the U'1 signals was greater than 100 times that of V'2 signals obtained in a conventional cavity. Another advantage of the U'1 display is that signals from weakly immobilized probes, i.e., probes that have nanosecond rotational mobility relative to the labeled protein (myosin), are greatly suppressed relative to strongly immobilized probes. This reduces the ambiguity of spectral analysis, and eliminates the need for chemical treatments [e.g., using K3Fe(CN)6] that were previously required in muscle fibers and other systems. Further suppression of this weakly immobilized component was achieved in U'1 spectra by increasing the microwave power and decreasing the field modulation frequency.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7207,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.002741556,0

Extracts of 14C-labeled and unlabeled LPS from Salmonella abortus equi and lipid A from Salmonella minnesota R 595 (Re) were administered intravenously in doses sufficient to induce endotoxic shock. Sixty minutes after administration of 14C-LPS, 40% of the total activity was found in the liver tissue, 10% was in the isolated nonparenchymal cells, and only 1% was in the isolated hepatocytes. However, at this time only one third of the hepatocytes could be isolated; the other two thirds were obviously damaged. After 240 minutes, 55% of the total activity was measured in the liver tissue. The nonparenchymal cells had 8% of the activity, and all hepatocytes were damaged. By use of immunofluorescence, LPS S abortus equi was localized in sinusoidal cells 5 to 10 minutes after administration, and LPS S minnesota R 595 and lipid A were found in both nonparenchymal and parenchymal liver cells. All toxins were localized in both cell populations 60 and 240 minutes after injection. After application of LPS or lipid A, the third complement component (C3) was detectable in sinusoidal cells.

To test this suggestion, anthranilic acid was administered to rats; there was no increase in either the concentration of nicotinamide nucleotides in the liver or the urinary excretion of N1-methyl nicotinamide. However, injection of either kynurenine or 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid did increase the concentration of nicotinamide nucleotides in the liver.

7225377,"Studies on the mechanism of membrane fusion. Role of head-group composition in calcium- and magnesium-induced fusion of mixed phospholipid vesicles. We have investigated the contribution of various phospholipids to membrane fusion induced by divalent cations. Fusion was followed by means of a new fluorescence assay monitoring the mixing of internal aqueous contents of large (0.1 micrometer diameter) unilamellar liposomes. The rate and extent of fusion induced by Ca2+ in mixed phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine vesicles were lower compared to those in pure phosphatidylserine vesicles. The presence of 50% phosphatidylcholine completely inhibited fusion, although the vesicles aggregated upon Ca2+ addition. When phosphatidylserine was mixed with phosphatidylethanolamine, however, rapid fusion could be induced by Ca2+ even in mixtures that contained only 25% phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylethanolamine also facilitated fusion by Mg2+ which could not fuse pure phosphatidylserine vesicles. In phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylcholine mixtures, in which the phosphatidylcholine content was kept at 25%, phosphatidylethanolamine could not substitute for phosphatidylserine, and the fusogenic capacity of Mg2+ was abolished by the presence of merely 10% phosphatidylcholine. The initial rate of release of vesicle contents was slower than the rate of fusion in all the mixtures used. The presence of phosphate effected a considerable decrease in the threshold concentration of Ca2+ and also enhanced the rate and extent of fusion. Mg2+ had a synergistic effect on Ca2+-induced fusion of phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylethanolamine vesicles. We suggest that the role of phospholipids in membrane fusion is related to their ability to form dehydrated intermembrane complexes with divalent cations.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7278,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.004442395,0

Its physical state, which is controversially discussed in previous publications, was investigated using small-angle X-ray scattering, dynamic light scattering, mass spectrometry, and circular dichroism (CD). Our results unequivocally demonstrate that prothymosin is a monomer under physiological conditions.

Nevertheless, crucial contacts with the active site of the other monomer involving motif 1 are conserved and a more comprehensive description of class II now becomes possible. Each monomer consists of an active site strongly resembling that of the aspartyl and seryl enzymes, a C-terminal anticodon recognition domain of 100 residues and a third domain unusually inserted between motifs 1 and 2 almost certainly interacting with the acceptor arm of tRNA(Gly). The C-terminal domain has a novel five-stranded parallel-antiparallel beta-sheet structure with three surrounding helices.

The secretion of the 107 kDa hemolysin A (HlyA) from Escherichia coli is mediated by membrane proteins hemolysin B (HlyB) and hemolysin D (HlyD). The signal for transport has been mapped to the C-terminal 60 amino acids of the HylA molecule. We have shown previously that the C-terminal 70 amino acids of leukotoxin (LktA) from Pasteurella hemolytica can substitute functionally for the HlyA signal sequence. This 70 amino acid peptide contains little primary sequence similarity to the HlyA signal sequence, and we have hypothesized that these signal sequences assume a similar higher-order structure which is recognized by the HlyB/D transporter. In the present study, we have expressed and purified small peptides containing the C-terminal 61 amino acids of HlyA and the C-terminal 70 amino acids of LktA. We show that these signal peptides are sufficient for secretion from E. coli in a HlyB/D dependent manner. Circular dichroism analyses show that both molecules exhibit common biophysical properties.

8210277,"Stereotype or reality: another look at alcohol and drug use among African American children. The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention's Division of Communications Programs launched its Urban Youth Public Education Campaign in late 1990 to target African American youth in 14 cities with prevention messages about alcohol and other drugs. During the market research phase of the campaign, the Center sought to determine the extent inner city African American children are impacted by alcohol and other drugs and how widespread the use of these substances is among younger children. Is it rampant and universal, as some press accounts have it, or are the images portrayed by the news media, by popular movies, and by other communication outlets fueling harmful stereotypes? The campaign's market research consisted of in-depth reviews of the literature, of personal communications, conference proceedings, grant and contract reports, monographs, newspaper and magazine articles, and of national survey results, and the analysis of findings from focus groups conducted with 143 African American children living in several urban environments. Although information and conclusions gleaned from the market research revealed a longstanding trend of comparatively lower rates of alcohol and drug use by African American youth, also disclosed was a need for an expanded framework to address the problems of substance abuse within the African American community. An expanded framework acknowledges the dimension of substance use and abuse but also addresses three other dimensions--involvement, exposure, and victimization--that unfold as having major significance for this population of youth who live in urban, high-risk environments.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7399,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.001976184,0
8211380,"DNA methylation of the fragile X locus in somatic and germ cells during fetal development: relevance to the fragile X syndrome and X inactivation. To obtain insights into mechanisms responsible for methylation of CpG islands on the inactive X chromosome of normal females, we examined methylation of the fragile X (FraX) locus in a variety of tissues from normal fetuses and adults, and from males with the FraX syndrome. We identified 20 CCGG sites (MspI-HpaII sites M1-M20) within a 12-kb BglII fragment that includes the CpG island. Sites M3-M18, within the 1.2-kb CpG island are unmethylated on the active X in normal males and females at all ages and in all tissues studied. In contrast, these sites are at least partially methylated on the inactive X chromosome in a variety of tissues from normal females by six weeks from conception. The exceptional tissues are chorionic villi and gonads, which are significantly undermethylated. In addition, fetal germ cells are unmethylated at site M3, which is methylated on the inactive X in other tissues; thus, the methylation imprint of the inactive X has been erased. Methylation of the locus on the fragile X chromosome is similar to that of the normal inactive X but is more extensive and less heterogeneous. This suggests that the expansion of the island and the greater number of CpGs that result from amplification of the CGG repeat enhance the methylatibility of the island. Additional studies show that the chromatin of the CpG island is nuclease hypersensitive on the active X but insensitive on both inactive and FraX.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7400,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.012288597,0
8215586,"Detection and characterization of endogenous protease associated with desquamation of stratum corneum. In order to identify the endogenous protease associated with stratum corneum (SC) desquamation, we examined properties of proteases in the stratum corneum of normal human skin. SC were obtained by tape stripping, washed in toluene and then dried. The proteolytic activity in SC was measured using peptidyl 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amides (MCAs). The SC was dispersed uniformly in the reaction mixture with dimethylformamide and Triton X-100 and incubated with the peptidyl MCAs. The protease in the SC hydrolysed both Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA and Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA (substrates for trypsin) very effectively. The hydrolytic activity was inhibited by the serine protease inhibitors diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), aprotinin, antipain and leupeptin, but not by chymostatin, a chymotrypsin inhibitor. These results show that one or more trypsin-like serine protease is present in the SC of normal human skin. Casein-acrylamide electrophoresis showed that the molecular weight of this serine protease was about 30 kDa. We have previously shown that cells dissociate from human SC sheets in a detergent mixture (N,N-dimethyldodecylamine oxide and sodium lauryl sulphate). This cell dissociation was inhibited by aprotinin and leupeptin. In addition, the proteolytic activity in the outer SC was higher than that in the inner SC, and the activity in the SC of scaly skin induced by SLS treatment was higher than that of untreated skin. These results strongly suggest that the trypsin-like serine protease described here is involved in SC desquamation.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7402,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.015276946,0
8243650,"Nature of the pH-induced conformational changes and exposure of the C-terminal region of chromogranin A. Chromogranin A is known to undergo pH induced conformational changes, and the difference in conformation is supposed to be responsible for the difference in Ca2+ binding property. To gain insight regarding the overall structure and the nature of pH-induced conformational changes of chromogranin A, limited trypsin digestions were carried out at pH 5.5 and pH 7.5. The resulting fragments were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the amino acid sequences of the tryptic fragments were determined. From these analyses it was shown that the chromogranin A structure consists of an N-terminal compact core region and a rather loosely organized C-terminal region and that the change of pH from 7.5 to 5.5 loosened the overall structure of chromogranin A, exposing the C-terminal region. Since the conserved C-terminal region (residues 407-431) was shown to exist in monomer-dimer and monomer-tetramer equilibria at pH 7.5 and 5.5, respectively, the conformational changes of the region at pH 7.5 and 5.5 were studied by circular dichroism spectroscopy using a synthetic peptide representing the conserved C-terminal region. When the pH was changed from 7.5 to 5.5, the coil structure of the C-terminal peptide decreased with an accompanying increase of alpha-helicity.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,7406,pos_MEDLINE,0.98524296,1

The conformational preferences of a 43-amino-acid G-actin-binding peptide, thymosin beta 4, in water at 1, 4 and 14 degrees C, and at pH 3.0 and 6.5 were studied by NMR. NMR showed that thymosin beta 4 lacks a uniquely folded conformation in water. However, some preferential alpha-helical conformations of thymosin beta 4 can be observed in aqueous solutions. The segment at residues 5-16 showed characteristic interactions for conformations in both the beta-strand and alpha-helical regions of the phi-psi space, based on strong C alpha H(i)-NH(i+1) interactions and NH-NH, C alpha H(i)-NH(i+3), and C alpha H(i)-C beta H(i+3) interactions, respectively. At 1-4 degrees C, another segment at residues 31-37 also shows both beta and alpha conformations, forming however a less well-defined helix than the segment at residues 5-16.

Lumbosacral spinal neurons activated via the spinocervical tract were stained by intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase in cats anaesthetized with chloralose and paralysed with gallamine triethiodide. The neurons were activated orthodromically by single shock stimulation of the ipsilateral dorsolateral funiculus at the second to third cervical segment, but not from the rostral part of the first cervical segment. Twenty nine cells were recovered from the histological material and subsequently reconstructed from transverse sections. Sixteen cells (55%) had axons that projected ipsilaterally to the lateral funiculus and their somata were located in two regions of the spinal cord, one group in the dorsal horn (laminae IV-V) and the other in the intermediate gray matter (laminae VI-VII). The axons of 10 of these cells gave off collaterals, and in seven of them the collaterals ramified in the grey matter deep to the cell body. The axons of five cells (17%) projected medially towards the central canal, four crossing the mid line in the ventral white commissure and ascending in the contralateral ventral funiculus. Only one of these cells had an axon collateral that crossed into the contralateral dorsal horn. Of the remaining eight cells, three had no obvious long axons but had many local axon collaterals, the axons of three cells were not stained, one had an axon projecting towards the ipsilateral ventral funiculus and one was a motoneuron and its axon projected into a ventral root. A feature of the dendritic trees of many cells was their wide spread in the mediolateral and/or the dorsoventral directions, although no dendrites reached dorsally into lamina II. Twenty-two cells (76%) were excited by moving hairs and by noxious pinch, three (10%) by hair movement alone, two (7%) by noxious pinch and pressure, and for two cells (7%) no receptive field could be found.

After solubilization of viral envelope, NS2 was still associated with ribonucleoprotein cores, but was later dissociated upon removal of the M1 protein. A filter-binding assay in vitro indicated direct protein-protein contact between M1 and NS2. Following chemical cleavage of the M1 protein, NS2 bound only a C-terminal fragment of M1.

Some macrolide antibiotics cause clinical drug interactions, resulting in altered metabolism of concomitantly administered drugs, via formation of an inactive cytochrome P-450 complex. In the present study, the formation of a cytochrome P-450 type I binding spectrum and a metabolic intermediate complex by troleandomycin and dirithromycin was assessed in liver microsomes obtained from untreated rats and phenobarbital- or dexamethasone-pretreated rats. Troleandomycin produced a type I binding spectrum and metabolic intermediate complex in microsomes from dexamethasone- and phenobarbital-pretreated rats. Dirithromycin did not produce a detectable type I binding spectrum but formed a small cytochrome P-450 metabolic intermediate complex (6% of that formed by troleandomycin) in microsomes from dexamethasone-pretreated rats only. The formation of a cytochrome P-450 type I binding spectrum and a metabolic intermediate complex by troleandomycin, erythromycin, dirithromycin, and erythromycylamine was also assessed in microsomes prepared from human livers. Troleandomycin and erythromycin formed a type I binding spectrum and a metabolic intermediate complex which were larger in microsomes from subjects on barbiturate therapy than in microsomes from subjects with no recent barbiturate exposure. Erythromycylamine did not form a detectable type I binding spectrum with any of the human microsomal samples, but a small metabolic intermediate complex was formed with microsomes from a subject on phenobarbital, phenytoin, and propranolol therapy. Dirithromycin did not form a detectable type I binding spectrum or a metabolic intermediate complex in any human liver sample.

Calcineurin (CaN) is a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein serine/threonine phosphate which is critical for several important cellular processes, including T-cell activation. CaN is the target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506, which inhibit CaN after forming complexes with cytoplasmic binding proteins (cyclophilin and FKBP12, respectively). We report here the crystal structures of full-length human CaN at 2.1 A resolution and of the complex of human CaN with FKBP12-FK506 at 3.5 A resolution. In the native CaN structure, an auto-inhibitory element binds at the Zn/Fe-containing active site.

The Escherichia coli repressor of biotin biosynthesis (BirA) is a unique transcriptional repressor which catalyzes synthesis of its own corepressor and catalyzes attachment of a cofactor to an essential metabolic enzyme. BirA both catalyzes synthesis of biotinyl-5'-AMP from the substrates ATP and biotin and transfer of the biotin moiety from the adenylate to a lysine residue of a subunit of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase. BirA-bio-5'-AMP, moreover, binds sequence specifically to the biotin operator to repress transcription of the biotin biosynthetic genes. Using a combination of kinetic measurements of binding of the two ligands, biotin and bio-5'-AMP, to BirA as well as proteolytic digestion experiments, we have found evidence for at least three discrete conformational states of BirA. Results of stopped-flow fluorescence measurements of association of both ligands with BirA indicate that the process involves initial formation of a collision complex followed by a slow conformational change. The kinetics of the conformational change are distinct for the two ligands and are the basis for the difference in the thermodynamic stabilities of the two protein-ligand complexes. Different rates of proteolytic digestion of apoBirA and complexes of BirA with the two ligands were also observed.

The solution structure of a fragment of the human U1A spliceosomal protein containing residues 2 to 117 (U1A117) determined using multi-dimensional heteronuclear NMR is presented. The C-terminal region of the molecule is considerably more ordered in the free protein than thought previously and its conformation is different from that seen in the crystal structure of the complex with U1 RNA hairpin II. The residues between Asp90 and Lys98 form an alpha-helix that lies across the beta-sheet, with residues IIe93, IIe94 and Met97 making contacts with Leu44, Phe56 and IIe58. This interaction prevents solvent exposure of hydrophobic residues on the surface of the beta-sheet, thereby stabilising the protein. Upon RNA binding, helix C moves away from this position, changing its orientation by 135 degrees to allow Tyr13, Phe56 and Gln54 to stack with bases of the RNA, and also allowing Leu44 to contact the RNA. The new position of helix C in the complex with RNA is stabilised by hydrophobic interactions from IIe93 and IIe94 to IIe58, Leu 41, Val62 and His 10, as well as a hydrogen bond between Ser91 and Thr11. The movement of helix C mainly involves changes in the main-chain torsion angles of Thr89, Asp90 and Ser91, the helix thereby acting as a ""lid"" over the RNA binding surface.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,7456,pos_MEDLINE,0.9975177,1

In order to understand how human c-myc functions as a transcription factor, we have studied the mechanism of action and structure of the N-terminal transactivation domain, amino acids 1-143. In a protein interaction assay, c-myc1-143 bound selectively to two basal transcription factors, the TATA binding protein (TBP) and the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF. Furthermore, the isolated c-myc transactivation domain competed for limiting factors required for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex. This squelching of basal transcription was reversed in a dose-dependent manner by recombinant TBP. Taken together, these results identify TBP as an important target for the c-myc transactivation domain, during transcriptional initiation. Similar to other transactivation domains, the c-myc1-143 polypeptide showed little or no evidence of secondary structure, when measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) in aqueous solution. However, significant alpha-helical conformation was observed in the presence of the hydrophobic solvent trifluoroethanol. Strikingly, addition of TBP caused changes in the CD spectra consistent with induction of protein conformation in c-myc1-143 during interaction with the target factor. This change was specific for TBP as a similar effect was not observed in the presence of TFIIB.

BACKGROUND Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) catalyze the formation of the deoxyribonucleotides that are essential for DNA synthesis. The R2 subunit of Escherichia coli RNR is a homodimer containing one dinuclear iron centre per monomer. A tyrosyl radical is essential for catalysis, and is formed via a reaction in which the reduced, diferrous form of the iron centre activates dioxygen. To help understand the mechanism of oxygen activation, we examined the structure of the diferrous form of R2. RESULTS The crystal structures of reduced forms of both wild type R2 and a mutant of R2 (Ser211--> Ala) have been determined at 1.7 A and 2.2 A resolution, respectively. The diferrous iron centre was compared to the previously determined structure of the oxidized, diferric form of R2. In both forms of R2 the iron centre is coordinated by the same carboxylate dominated ligand sphere, but in the reduced form there are clear conformational changes in three of the carboxylate ligands and the bridging mu-oxo group and two water molecules are lost. In the reduced form of R2 the coordination number decreases from six to four for both ferrous ions, explaining their high reactivity towards dioxygen. The structure of the mutant Ser211--> Ala, known to have impaired reduction kinetics, shows a large conformational change in one of the neighbouring helices although the iron coordination is very similar to the wild type protein. CONCLUSIONS Carboxylate shifts are often important for carboxylate coordinated metal clusters; they allow the metals to achieve different coordination modes in redox reactions. In the case of reduced R2 these carboxylate shifts allow the formation of accessible reaction sites for dioxygen. The Ser211--> Ala mutant displays a conformational change in the helix containing the mutation, explaining its altered reduction kinetics.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,7498,pos_MEDLINE,0.99719906,1

PURPOSE To describe the use of combination chemotherapy, including divided-dose oral methotrexate (dMTX), for children with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). dMTX produced prolonged MTX exposure on an outpatient basis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two hundred forty-three patients were treated from January 1986 to May 1992. dMTX was given weekly during consolidation and biweekly for the first 16 months of continuation therapy with mercaptopurine (6-MP) and asparaginase (L-ASP). Initially, etoposide (VP-16) and cytarabine (Ara-C) pulses were included. Treatment continued for 30 months with single-dose weekly MTX replacing dMTX during continuation, part 2. Unexpected acute neurotoxicity was eliminated by the addition of leucovorin. VP-16 and Ara-C were omitted in the face of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). RESULTS Two hundred thirty-nine patients entered remission: 16 had a lymphoid marrow relapse, two each with testicular or CNS relapse; 19 a CNS relapse; 16 secondary AML; three other second malignancies; two withdrew for transplant; three died in remission; 16 withdrew because of noncompliance, and nine withdrew with toxicity. Event-free survival (EFS) at 4 years was 73 +/- 4%; 81 +/- 4% for 150 patients with better risk features and 60 +/- 7% for 93 with high-risk features. Lymphoid marrow relapse-free survival in the standard- and high-risk patients was 94 +/- 3% and 86% +/- 6%, respectively. The most common adverse event was secondary AML in the standard-risk group and isolated CNS relapse in the high-risk group. CONCLUSION This therapy produced an overall EFS similar to other published regimens, but the pattern of failures is very different, with few patients having a lymphoid marrow relapse.

BACKGROUND [corrected] Aldolases catalyze a variety of condensation and cleavage reactions, with exquisite control on the stereochemistry. These enzymes, therefore, are attractive catalysts for synthetic chemistry. There are two classes of aldolase: class I aldolases utilize Schiff base formation with an active-site lysine whilst class II enzymes require a divalent metal ion, in particular zinc. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBP-aldolase) is used in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis; the enzyme controls the condensation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to yield fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Structures are available for class I FBP-aldolases but there is a paucity of detail on the class II enzymes. Characterization is sought to enable a dissection of structure/activity relationships which may assist the construction of designed aldolases for use as biocatalysts in synthetic chemistry. RESULTS The structure of the dimeric class II FBP-aldolase from Escherichia coli has been determined using data to 2.5 A resolution. The asymmetric unit is one subunit which presents a familiar fold, the (alpha/beta)8 barrel. The active centre, at the C-terminal end of the barrel, contains a novel bimetallic-binding site with two metal ions 6.2 A apart. One ion, the identity of which is not certain, is buried and may play a structural or activating role. The other metal ion is zinc and is positioned at the surface of the barrel to participate in catalysis. CONCLUSIONS Comparison of the structure with a class II fuculose aldolase suggests that these enzymes may share a common mechanism. Nevertheless, the class II enzymes should be subdivided into two categories on consideration of subunit size and fold, quaternary structure and metal-ion binding sites.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,7520,pos_MEDLINE,0.99712163,1

The 3.0-A resolution x-ray structure of human des-Gla-coagulation factor Xa (fXa) has been determined in complex with the synthetic inhibitor DX-9065a. The binding geometry is characterized primarily by two interaction sites: the naphthamidine group is fixed in the S1 pocket by a typical salt bridge to Asp-189, while the pyrrolidine ring binds in the unique aryl-binding site (S4) of fXa. Unlike the large majority of inhibitor complexes with serine proteinases, Gly-216 (S3) does not contribute to hydrogen bond formation.

8999925,"Two-step processing is not essential for the import and assembly of functionally active iron-sulfur protein into the cytochrome bc1 complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The iron-sulfur protein of the cytochrome bc1 complex is one of a small number of proteins that are processed in two sequential steps by matrix processing peptidase (MPP) and mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP) during import into Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria. To test whether two-step processing is necessary for import and assembly of the iron-sulfur protein into the cytochrome bc1 complex, we mutagenized the presequence of the iron-sulfur protein to eliminate the original MPP site and replace the MIP site with a new MPP site. The mutated presequence is cleaved and forms mature-sized protein in a single step, and the mature-sized iron-sulfur protein is correctly targeted to the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane in vitro. Mutant iron-sulfur protein which is processed to mature size in one step complements the respiratory deficient phenotype of a yeast strain in which the endogenous gene for the iron-sulfur protein is deleted. These results establish that mature-sized iron-sulfur protein can be formed by single-step processing and assembled into a functionally active form in the cytochrome bc1 complex in S. cerevisiae.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7531,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.07470251,0

The disclosure of disease genetically conditioned depends, in many cases, on the effect of a broad spectrum of different environmental factors. Screening tests for carries of defective genes play a key role in the detection of risk for genetically conditioned diseases. Screening tests carried out for many years yielded a very diversified results. Some of them, for example, the screening test for the gene responsible for Tay-Sachs disease, produced good results, whereas results of other tests, like the test for the gene responsible for crescent anaemia, proved to be unsatisfactory. Among genetically conditioned diseases, neoplastic diseases are the subject of particular interest. It is already known that these diseases may be attributed to the accumulation of genetic errors in a normal cell, and that this phenomena applies to certain categories of genes. An analysis of genetic material of persons from the families with higher cancer incidence revealed the relationship between cancer and inheritance of some defective genes. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the development of cancer is not definitely foregone even if genetic features of cancer disease are detected in a given person. The presence of such features only indicates an inborn or acquired defect (as a result of mutation) that predisposes him/her to illness. A great progress in molecular oncology made during the last years and the development of genetic maps relevant to neoplastic diseases should contribute to the detection of such genetic markers which could facilitate the identification of persons with a higher risk for neoplastic diseases and allow to take relevant preventive measures in due time.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7540,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.002238721,0

After furosemide 40 mg i. v. its plasma concentration was significantly higher during an 8-hour period in 6 patients with left sided heart failure than in 8 normal subjects. The plasma clearance was significantly lower in the patients than in the normal subjects--1.23 and 2.34 ml/kg/min, respectively. The apparently smaller volume of distribution in the cardiac patients (0.140 1/kg and 0.181 1/kg, respectively) was not significantly different. In the group of normal subjects, whose ages ranged from 27 to 74 years, no correlation was found between age and either plasma clearance or volume of distribution.

9084538,"[Similarity and synergy of trauma and sepsis: role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6]. Both trauma and infection cause a rise in body temperature, white blood cell count, acute phase proteins, fluid and sodium retention and negative nitrogen balance. This phenomenon is often described as ""acute phase response"" or ""systemic inflammatory response syndrome"" to denote a coordinated systemic response to significant tissue injury and/or microbial invasion. It is generally agreed that the acute phase response is mediated through the interaction of cytokine and neuroendocrine pathways. Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are two of the major key cytokines involved in the generation of acute phase response. Interleukin-6 are consistently found in septic, trauma and post-operative patients and correlated well with the severity of sepsis or injury. IL-6 is responsible for the fever and metabolic changes in the acute phase. In addition to IL-6, TNF-alpha was proved to be the mediator that orchestrates the hemodynamic and tissue injury in septic shock. TNF-alpha destroys endothelial cells and induces disseminated intravascular coagulation, fluid shift, shock, multiple organ system failure and death. On many clinical occasions, both infection and trauma may happen simultaneously on the same patient. Our study demonstrated that operation on the infected patients would cause a synergistic effect on both TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels. The pulse increase in TNF-alpha and the persistent elevation of IL-6 were responsible for the post-operative unstable clinical condition in the infected patients. Should we block the cytokine signal and inflammatory response that appear to be harmful? Animal studies have shown that the septic shock to endotoxin challenge can be prevented by pretreatment with monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha. The transcription of TNF-alpha can be blocked with corticosteroid in vivo. The post-operative increase in IL-6 and its related inflammation can be attenuated with corticosteroid, epidural anesthesia and narcotics. However, although blocking the inflammatory response has a beneficial effect of stress free it also eliminates our ability to fight with bacterial infection by lowering our immune response. How to manipulate these cytokines is a question of art more than science.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7551,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0018066854,0
9152048,"Two components of transmitter release in retinal bipolar cells: exocytosis and mobilization of synaptic vesicles. Ca2+-transmitter release coupling was examined using bipolar cells with large presynaptic terminals dissociated from the goldfish retina. Presynaptic Ca2+ current (I(Ca)) was recorded under the whole-cell voltage clamp. Release of excitatory amino acid transmitter was simultaneously monitored as the current through N-methyl-D-asperate (NMDA) receptors of reporter cells or as the membrane capacitance (C(m)) change associated with exocytosis. When I(Ca) was activated by a long depolarizing pulse, a double-peaked transmitter-induced current (I(tr)) was elicited in reporter cells. The rapid component of I(tr) was evoked immediately after the onset of depolarization, and was affected only slightly by intracellularly applied Ca2+ chelators. The delayed slow component of I(tr) was elicited during depolarization once a fixed amount of Ca2+ was accumulated in presynaptic terminals, and its appearance was suppressed or retarded by Ca2+ chelators. Two components of transmitter release were also recognized by monitoring C(m) changes elicited by the activation of I(Ca). These results suggest that bipolar cells have at least two pools of synaptic vesicles; a small, immediately releasable pool and a large releasable pool.

9153421,"Thymosin beta 4 binds actin in an extended conformation and contacts both the barbed and pointed ends. The beta-thymosins are a family of highly polar peptides which serve in vivo to maintain a reservoir of unpolymerized actin monomers. In vitro, beta-thymosins form 1:1 complexes with actin monomers and inhibit both polymerization and exchange of the bound nucleotide. Circular dichroism data indicate that free thymosin beta 4 is predominantly unstructured, containing at most six residues of alpha-helix, and that up to six additional residues may adopt an alpha-helical conformation upon binding actin. NMR data indicate that many parts of thymosin beta 4 are not in tight contact with actin. Contacts between specific residues in actin and thymosin beta 4 were identified by zero-length cross-linking followed by isolation and sequencing of cross-linked peptides. After carbodiimide-mediated cross-linking, Lys-3 of thymosin beta 4 was cross-linked to Glu-167 of actin, and Lys-18 of thymosin beta 4 was cross-linked to one of the the N-terminal acidic residues of actin (Asp-1-Glu-4); the cross-linked actin residues lie within subdomains 3 and 1, respectively. These two contacts flank the alpha-helical region of thymosin beta 4 and place it on the barbed end; thymosin beta 4 can thus block actin polymerization sterically. After transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking, Lys-38 of thymosin beta 4 was cross-linked to Gln-41 of actin, placing the C-terminal region of thymosin beta 4 in contact with subdomain 2 on the pointed end; thymosin beta 4 may sterically block actin polymerization at the pointed end as well as the barbed end of the monomer.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a 185 amino acid cytokine which exerts multiple biological effects in vivo and whose dysregulation underlies several disease processes. The solution structure of recombinant human interleukin-6 has now been determined using heteronuclear three and four-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The structure of the molecule was determined using 3044 distance and torsion restraints derived by NMR spectroscopy to generate an ensemble of 32 structures using a combined distance geometry/simulated annealing protocol. The protein contains five alpha-helices interspersed with variable-length loops; four of these helices constitute a classical four-helix bundle with the fifth helix located in the CD loop. There were no distance violations greater than 0.3 A in any of the final 32 structures and the ensemble has an average-to-the-mean backbone root-mean-square deviation of 0.50 A for the core four-helix bundle. Although the amino-terminal 19 amino acids are disordered in solution, the remainder of the molecule has a well defined structure that shares many features displayed by other long-chain four-helix bundle cytokines.

9227681,"Continuous intraoperative monitoring of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities and electroencephalography during carotid endarterectomy. A comparison of the two methods to detect cerebral ischemia. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Intraoperative monitoring of brain function may influence the outcome of carotid endarterectomy (CEA). METHODS We performed transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities (VMCAs) and eight-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) recording simultaneously in 82 patients undergoing CEA. Thiopental narcosis limited EEG interpretation in 11 patients, thus allowing direct comparison of both methods in 71 patients. RESULTS There was a significant correlation between VMCA decrease and the frequency of EEG changes after carotid clamping (P < .001). Eight patients (11%) showed a VMCA decrease exceeding 60%, accompanied by EEG changes in 7 patients. Altogether, 16 patients (22%) showed severe or moderate EEG changes. Stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery led to an increase of abnormal findings with both monitoring methods, which was, however, significant only for TCD (P < .05). Four patients (4.8%) suffered intraoperative transient ischemic attacks. In 3 of these patients, there were no abnormal findings with either of the methods. The events were thus unpredictable and probably of embolic origin. The fourth patient showed VMCA decrease to 0 and severe EEG changes. Nine patients had severe or moderate EEG changes without significant VMCA decrease and without complications. EEG monitoring alone in these would have led to unnecessary use of a shunt with the increased risk of embolism. CONCLUSION EEG and TCD monitoring are complementary techniques. Their results showed a good overall correlation but with marked differences in the individual patient. TCD monitoring alone was sensitive enough to prevent ischemic intraoperative complications. EEG findings are of limited value when barbiturates are used.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7579,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0029868432,0

Bone sialoprotein is a small, sulfated, and phosphorylated integrin-binding glycoprotein apparently found only in tissues that eventually mineralize. Nondenatured bone sialoprotein (BSP) purified from rat osteosarcoma cell line (UMR 106-01 BSP) culture media is shown to have a hydroxyapatite Kd approximately 2.6 x 10(-9) M, perhaps the strongest affinity for this mineral of any of the matrix proteins. Both native BSP and a 47 kD fragment of UMR-BSP (Fragment 1 approximately 133A- approximately 265Y) are more potent inhibitors of seeded hydroxyapatite crystal growth than recombinant human BSP fragments lacking post-translational modifications. The recombinant proteins, however, do show reproducible inhibitory activity, suggesting that at least some of the strong mineral-binding properties are encoded directly within the protein sequence itself. BSP facilitates the adhesion of several cell types through its integrin binding (RGD) tripeptide sequence. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of a 15N-enriched 59 amino acid recombinant domain containing the RGD tripeptide shows that the structure of this isolated domain is highly flexible with or without 5 mM calcium. Previous work has also shown that an endogenous fragment of UMR-BSP (Fragment 1) supports cell adhesion in the absence of the RGD sequence. In this report, non-RGD cell adhesion sites are localized within conserved amino- and carboxy-terminal tyrosine-rich domains of recombinant human BSP.

Mutagenesis studies have revealed that the minimal DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor ADR1 consists of two Cys2-His2 zinc fingers plus an additional 20 residues proximal and N-terminal to the fingers. We have assigned NMR 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shifts for the entire minimal DNA-binding domain of ADR1 both free and bound to specific DNA. 1H chemical shift values suggest little structural difference between the zinc fingers in this construct and in single-finger constructs, and 13C alpha chemical shift index analysis indicates little change in finger structure upon DNA binding. 1H chemical shift perturbations upon DNA binding are observed, however, and these are mapped to define the protein-DNA interface. The two zinc fingers appear to bind DNA with different orientations, as the entire helix of finger 1 is perturbed, while only the extreme N-terminus of the finger 2 helix is affected. Furthermore, residues N-terminal to the first finger undergo large chemical shift changes upon DNA binding suggesting a role at the protein-DNA interface.

Activation of gluatmine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (RPPP) amidotransferase (GPATase) by binding of a PRPP substrate analog results in the formation of a 20 A channel connecting the active site for glutamine hydrolysis in one domain with the PRPP site in a second domain. This solvent-inaccessible channel permits transfer of the NH3 intermediate between the two active sites. Tunneling of NH3 may be a common mechanism for glutamine amidotransferase-catalyzed nitrogen transfer and for coordination of catalysis at two distinct active sites in complex enzymes. The 2.4 A crystal structure of the active conformer of GPATase also provides the first description of an intact active site for the phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase) family of nucleotide synthesis and salvage enzymes.

The 77-residue delta sleep-inducing peptide immunoreactive peptide (DIP) is a close homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster shortsighted gene product. Porcine DIP (pDIP) and a peptide containing a leucine zipper-related partial sequence of pDIP, pDIP(9-46), was synthesized and studied by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with molecular dynamics calculations. Ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, and model calculations indicated that pDIP forms a dimer. This was confirmed by the observation of concentration-dependent thermal folding-unfolding transitions. From CD spectroscopy and thermal folding-unfolding transitions of pDIP(9-46), it was concluded that the dimerization of pDIP is a result of interaction between helical structures localized in the leucine zipper motif. The three-dimensional structure of the protein was determined with a modified simulated annealing protocol using experimental data derived from nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and a modeling approach based on an established strategy for coiled coil structures. The left-handed super helical structure of the leucine zipper type sequence resulting from the modeling approach is in agreement with known leucine zipper structures. In addition to the hydrophobic interactions between the amino acids at the heptade positions a and d, the structure of pDIP is stabilized by the formation of interhelical i to i' + 5 salt bridges. This result was confirmed by the pH dependence of the thermal-folding transitions. In addition to the amphipatic helix of the leucine zipper, a second helix is formed in the NH2-terminal part of pDIP.

Some multidrug-resistant cell lines efflux anticancer drugs but do not overexpress the well-known P-glycoprotein pump or Pgp. A 190 kDa or multidrug-resistant associated protein (MRP) has been identified and described as an MDR mediator. Many studies on cells overexpressing MRP and Pgp, show a concentration of the drug inside cytoplasmic vesicles followed by an exocytotic process. We studied daunorubicin (DNR) subcellular distribution in the presence of an H+-ATPase pump inhibitor 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) and verapamil (VPL) in two human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 etoposide-resistant and adriamycin-resistant cell lines, overexpressing respectively MRP (MCF7/VP) and Pgp (MCF7/ADR). Nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of daunorubicin was carried out using scanning confocal microspectrofluorometry. This technique allows the determination of nuclear accumulation of anthracyclines. Our results show that NBD was able to increase the nuclear accumulation of DNR in MCF7/VP but not in MCF7/ADR cells. Similarly, NBD could reverse DNR resistance in MCF7/VP cells but had no effect on DNR cytotoxicity in MCF7/ADR cells. VPL caused a significant increase in nuclear accumulation of DNR in MCF7/VP and MCF7/ADR cells. Incubation of MCF7/VP and MCF7/ADR cells with VPL, increased the sensitivity of these cells. These data demonstrate clearly that even if vesicular sequestration can happen in cells overexpressing MRP and Pgp proteins, only the MRP protein is able to extrude the drug through intracellular vesicles and efflux. In cells overexpressing Pgp, drug efflux probably takes place directly at the membrane level.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7633,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.033494532,0
9539726,"Light-activated rhodopsin induces structural binding motif in G protein alpha subunit. A large superfamily of transmembrane receptors control cellular responses to diverse extracellular signals by catalyzing activation of specific types of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins. How these receptors recognize and promote nucleotide exchange on G protein alpha subunits to initiate signal amplification is unknown. The three-dimensional structure of the transducin (Gt) alpha subunit C-terminal undecapeptide Gtalpha(340-350) IKENLKDCGLF was determined by transferred nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy while it was bound to photoexcited rhodopsin. Light activation of rhodopsin causes a dramatic shift from a disordered conformation of Gtalpha(340-350) to a binding motif with a helical turn followed by an open reverse turn centered at Gly-348, a helix-terminating C capping motif of an alphaL type. Docking of the NMR structure to the GDP-bound x-ray structure of Gt reveals that photoexcited rhodopsin promotes the formation of a continuous helix over residues 325-346 terminated by the C-terminal helical cap with a unique cluster of crucial hydrophobic side chains. A molecular mechanism by which activated receptors can control G proteins through reversible conformational changes at the receptor-G protein interface is demonstrated.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,7645,pos_MEDLINE,0.9979572,1
9622505,"Solution structure of the cytoplasmic domain of the human CD4 glycoprotein by CD and 1H NMR spectroscopy: implications for biological functions. The human T cell receptor CD4 is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein that is involved in T cell activation and also acts as the primary coreceptor for human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV). Here the structure of a synthetic 38 amino acid peptide corresponding to the complete cytoplasmic domain of CD4 (CD4CYTO) has been investigated under a variety of solution conditions using a combination of circular dichroism and homonuclear two-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the presence of the membrane mimetic 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), a conformational change of CD4CYTO from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure was observed. In keeping with this, CD4CYTO has the potential to associate with membranes as demonstrated by binding studies of in vitro phosphorylated CD4CYTO with microsomal membranes. Both chemical shift and nuclear Overhauser enhancement data in 50% 2,2, 2-trifluoroethanol solution provide direct experimental evidence for the predominance of a short amphiphatic alpha-helix that is approximately 4 turns in length and extends from positions Arg-402 to Lys-417. The present data provide, for the first time, compelling experimental evidence that only a fraction of CD4CYTO has a propensity for adopting secondary structure under conditions that are assumed to exist at or near to the membrane surface and that this alpha-helical structure is located in the membrane-proximal region of CD4CYTO. The N-terminal residues, that link the alpha-helix to the transmembrane anchor of CD4, and a substantial C-terminal portion (14-18 residues) of CD4CYTO are unstructured under the solution conditions investigated. Correlation of our structural data with recent studies on the biological activity of CD4CYTO indicates that the alpha-helix is of crucial importance for the interaction of CD4 with Nef and Vpu in the process of HIV-mediated CD4 down-regulation.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,7658,pos_MEDLINE,0.9979292,1

9684899,"The interaction of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 is an induced fit to a completely disordered protein. 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) inhibits translation by binding to the initiation factor eIF4E and is mostly or completely unstructured in both free and bound states. We wished to determine whether the free protein has local structure that could be involved in eIF4E binding. Assignments were obtained using double and triple resonance NMR methods. Residues 4-10, 43-46, and 56-65 could not be assigned, primarily because of a high degree of 1H and 15N chemical shift overlap. Steady-state ¿1H¿-15N NOEs were measured for 45 residues in the assigned regions. Except for the two C-terminal residues, the NOEs were between -0.77 and - 1.14, indicating a high level of flexibility. Furthermore, the ¿1H¿-15N NOE spectrum recorded with presaturation contained no strong positive signals, making it likely that no other residues have positive or smaller negative NOEs. This implies that 4E-BP1 has no regions of local order in the absence of eIF4E. The interaction therefore appears to be an induced fit to a completely disordered protein molecule.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,7678,pos_MEDLINE,0.9975321,1

Apoptosis requires recruitment of caspases by receptor-associated adaptors through homophilic interactions between the CARDs (caspase recruitment domains) of adaptor proteins and prodomains of caspases. We have solved the CARD structure of the RAIDD adaptor protein that recruits ICH-1/caspase-2. It consists of six tightly packed helices arranged in a topology homologous to the Fas death domain. The surface contains a basic and an acidic patch on opposite sides. This polarity is conserved in the ICH-1 CARD as indicated by homology modeling. Mutagenesis data suggest that these patches mediate CARD/CARD interaction between RAIDD and ICH-1. Subsequent modeling of the CARDs of Apaf-1 and caspase-9, as well as Ced-4 and Ced-3, showed that the basic/acidic surface polarity is highly conserved, suggesting a general mode for CARD/CARD interaction.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,7682,pos_MEDLINE,0.99779594,1

We report the crystal structure of a 50 kDa fragment of the 60 kDa yeast karyopherin alpha, in the absence and presence of a monopartite NLS peptide at 2.2 A and 2.8 A resolution, respectively. The structure shows a tandem array of ten armadillo repeats, organized in a right-handed superhelix of helices.

9737846,"Solution structure of methionine-oxidized amyloid beta-peptide (1-40). Does oxidation affect conformational switching?. The solution structure of Abeta(1-40)Met(O), the methionine-oxidized form of amyloid beta-peptide Abeta(1-40), has been investigated by CD and NMR spectroscopy. Oxidation of Met35 may have implications in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease. Circular dichroism experiments showed that whereas Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-40)Met(O) both adopt essentially random coil structures in water (pH 4) at micromolar concentrations, the former aggregates within several days while the latter is stable for at least 7 days under these conditions. This remarkable difference led us to determine the solution structure of Abeta(1-40)Met(O) using 1H NMR spectroscopy. In a water-SDS micelle medium needed to solubilize both peptides at the millimolar concentrations required to measure NMR spectra, chemical shift and NOE data for Abeta(1-40)Met(O) strongly suggest the presence of a helical region between residues 16 and 24. This is supported by slow H-D exchange of amide protons in this region and by structure calculations using simulated annealing with the program XPLOR. The remainder of the structure is relatively disordered. Our previously reported NMR data for Abeta(1-40) in the same solvent shows that helices are present over residues 15-24 (helix 1) and 28-36 (helix 2). Oxidation of Met35 thus causes a local and selective disruption of helix 2. In addition to this helix-coil rearrangement in aqueous micelles, the CD data show that oxidation inhibits a coil-to-beta-sheet transition in water. These significant structural rearrangements in the C-terminal region of Abeta may be important clues to the chemistry and biology of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42).",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,7693,pos_MEDLINE,0.9970421,1
9739089,"Crystal structure of JNK3: a kinase implicated in neuronal apoptosis. BACKGROUND The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, and regulate signal transduction in response to environmental stress. Activation and nuclear localization of JNK3, a neuronal-specific isoform of JNK, has been associated with hypoxic and ischemic damage of CA1 neurons in the hippocampus. Knockout mice lacking JNK3 showed reduced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and reduced seizure induced by kainic acid, a glutamate-receptor agonist. Thus, JNK3 may be important in the pathology of neurological disorders and is of significant medical interest. RESULTS We report here the structure of unphosphorylated JNK3 in complex with adenylyl imidodiphosphate, an ATP analog. JNK3 has a typical kinase fold, with the ATP-binding site situated within a cleft between the N- and C-terminal domains. In contrast to other known MAP kinase structures, the ATP-binding site of JNK3 is well ordered; the glycine-rich nucleotide-binding sequence forms a beta-strand-turn-beta-strand structure over the nucleotide. Unphosphorylated JNK3 assumes an open conformation, in which the N- and C-terminal domains are twisted apart relative to their positions in cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The rotation leads to the misalignment of some of the catalytic residues. The phosphorylation lip of JNK3 partially blocks the substrate-binding site. CONCLUSIONS This is the first JNK structure to be determined, providing a unique opportunity to compare structures from the three MAP kinase subfamilies. The structure reveals atomic-level details of the shape of JNK3 and the interactions between the kinase and the nucleotide. The misalignment of catalytic residues and occlusion of the active site by the phosphorylation lip may account for the low activity of unphosphorylated JNK3. The structure provides a framework for understanding the substrate specificity of different JNK isoforms, and should aid the design of selective JNK3 inhibitors.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,7694,pos_MEDLINE,0.99769044,1
9740629,"Relation between coronary artery disease, aortic stiffness, and left ventricular structure in a population sample. To elucidate the relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stiffness, and left ventricular structure, we recruited 55 subjects (33 men; average age, 63+/-1 years) with previously unknown CAD from a healthy general population sample, as well as 55 control subjects matched for gender, age, and serum cholesterol level. We measured arterial blood pressure and the systolic expansion of the transverse aorta and left ventricular structure by echocardiography. Aortic stiffness was higher in CAD patients than in controls, with a brachial pulse pressure of 59+/-3 versus 52+/-2 mm Hg and stiffness indices of Ep=212+/-26 versus 123+/-13 kN/m2 and beat=16+/-2 versus 9+/-1 (all P<0.01). Mean arterial pressure was similar in both groups during the measurements (95+/-2 versus 93+/-2 mm Hg, P=NS). Most CAD patients (61%) were in the highest stiffness quartile defined by the normal control values (P<0.05 versus control). Left ventricular mass index was also higher in CAD patients than in matched controls (139+/-5 versus 123+/-4 g/m2, P<0.05). We conclude that aortic stiffness and left ventricular mass are increased in subjects newly diagnosed as having CAD. This might explain previously reported associations of an increased mortality, particularly from CAD, found among subjects with elevated pulse pressures.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7696,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.003787458,0
9741622,"Solution structure of a TBP-TAF(II)230 complex: protein mimicry of the minor groove surface of the TATA box unwound by TBP. General transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAF(II)s), which together play a central role in both positive and negative regulation of transcription. The N-terminal region of the 230 kDa Drosophila TAF(II) (dTAF(II)230) binds directly to TBP and inhibits TBP binding to the TATA box. We report here the solution structure of the complex formed by dTAF(II)230 N-terminal region (residues 11-77) and TBP. dTAF(II)230(11-77) comprises three alpha helices and a beta hairpin, forming a core that occupies the concave DNA-binding surface of TBP. The TBP-binding surface of dTAF(II)230 markedly resembles the minor groove surface of the partially unwound TATA box in the TBP-TATA complex. This protein mimicry of the TATA element surface provides the structural basis of the mechanism by which dTAF(II)230 negatively controls the TATA box-binding activity within the TFIID complex.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,7698,pos_MEDLINE,0.99762183,1

A 130-residue fragment (D1-D4) taken from a fibronectin-binding protein of Staphylococcus aureus, which contains four fibronectin-binding repeats and is unfolded but biologically active at neutral pH, has been studied extensively by NMR spectroscopy. Using heteronuclear multidimensional techniques, the conformational properties of D1-D4 have been defined at both a global and a local level. Diffusion studies give an average effective radius of 26.2 +/- 0.1 A, approximately 75% larger than that expected for a globular protein of this size. Analysis of chemical shift, 3JHNalpha coupling constant, and NOE data show that the experimental parameters agree well overall with values measured in short model peptides and with predictions from a statistical model for a random coil. Sequences where specific features give deviations from these predictions for a random coil have however been identified. These arise from clustering of hydrophobic side chains and electrostatic interactions between charged groups. 15N relaxation studies demonstrate that local fluctuations of the chain are the dominant motional process that gives rise to relaxation of the 15N nuclei, with a persistence length of approximately 7-10 residues for the segmental motion. The consequences of the structural and dynamical properties of this unfolded protein for its biological role of binding to fibronectin have been considered. It is found that the regions of the sequence involved in binding have a high propensity for populating extended conformations, a feature that would allow a number of both charged and hydrophobic groups to be presented to fibronectin for highly specific binding.",MEDLINE,pos,1,pos,7723,pos_MEDLINE,0.9971048,1
9849842,"Osmotically-induced release of vasopressin and oxytocin in non-pregnant women--influence of estrogen and progesterone. BACKGROUND Circulating vasopressin and oxytocin are influenced by ovarian steroid blood levels, but the effect of estrogen and progestogen treatment on induced release of the posterior pituitary hormones is not clear. METHODS Eight postmenopausal women who had not been on hormonal replacement therapy for at least two months were included in the study. The women were treated for four weeks with transdermal administration of estradiol-17beta in a daily dose of 100 microg with the addition of 5 mg tablets of medoxyprogesterone twice daily for the last two weeks. A 25 minute intravenous infusion of hypertonic saline (0.06 mg/kg/min) was given before hormonal treatment, and after two and four weeks with serial plasma sampling for assay of vasopressin and oxytocin. RESULTS The mean basal concentration of vasopressin, which was 0.83+/-0.13 (SE) pmol/L before hormonal treatment, increased to a statistically significant degree after estradiol alone to 1.18+/-0.11 pmol/L and decreased after combined estrogen/progestogen treatment to 0.31+/-0.02 pmol/L. Sodium concentration and osmolality increased in a similar way during all three infusions, but the resultant increase in vasopressin concentration was significantly smaller and slower after treatment with estradiol alone than in the first experiment without pretreatment. The areas under the concentration curve for the second and third infusion were significantly smaller than when no hormone treatment was given. The induced hyperosmolality also caused a rise in oxytocin levels, but no influence of ovarian hormone treatment was observed. CONCLUSIONS Ovarian hormone administration influences vasopressin secretion, affecting both the basal levels in plasma and the responses to an increase in plasma osmolality. The influence of ovarian hormones on oxytocin secretion is minimal.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7728,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.004166256,0

Narrow 1H-NMR resonances at chemical shifts indicative of random coil conformations were observed in the difference spectrum. circular dichroism (CD) measurements further confirm that the mechanism of protection against proteolytic degradation is not based on structural transition or stabilization caused by the Gly/Ala-rich segment.

Na depletion inhibits electroneutral Na-Cl absorption in intact tissues and Na/H exchange in apical membrane vesicles (AMV) of rat distal colon. Two anion (Cl/HCO3 and Cl/OH) exchanges have been identified in AMV from surface cells of rat distal colon. To determine whether Cl/HCO3 and/or Cl/OH exchange is responsible for vectorial Cl movement, this study examined the spatial distribution and the effect of Na depletion on anion-dependent 36Cl uptake by AMV in rat distal colon. These studies demonstrate that HCO3 concentration gradient-driven 36Cl uptake (i.e., Cl/HCO3 exchange) is 1) primarily present in AMV from surface cells and 2) markedly reduced by Na depletion. In contrast, OH concentration gradient-driven 36Cl uptake (i.e., Cl/OH exchange) present in both surface and crypt cells is not affected by Na depletion. In Na-depleted animals HCO3 also stimulates 36Cl via Cl/OH exchange with low affinity. These results suggest that Cl/HCO3 exchange is responsible for vectorial Cl absorption, whereas Cl/OH exchange is involved in cell volume and/or cell pH homeostasis.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7738,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0030160663,0
9889419,"Apoptosis of endothelial cells. Contribution to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis?. Endothelial cell injury is a key event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Importantly, endothelial cells in lesion-prone regions, where atherosclerotic lesions preferentially develop, are characterised by increased endothelial cell turn-over rates suggesting a mechanistic link between endothelial cell turn-over with preceding cell death and the susceptibility to atherosclerotic plaque development. The activation of the cellular suicide pathway leading to apoptosis of the endothelial cell may be an initial step in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that proatherosclerotic factors such as angiotensin II, oxidized low density lipoprotein, reactive oxygen species, glucose and inflammatory cytokines have all been shown to induce apoptosis of endothelial cells. In contrast, the known atheroprotective factors, such as oestrogen, nitric oxide or anti-oxidants, prevented endothelial cell apoptosis. Furthermore, laminar flow, which seems to be one of the most potent endogenous anti-atherosclerotic factor as illustrated by the focal nature of atherosclerotic lesion development in areas with turbulent or low blood flow, protects endothelial cell from apoptotic cell death. The present article summarizes the effects of pro and anti-atherosclerotic factors on endothelial cell apoptosis and provides insights into the underlying signalling events.",MEDLINE,far_neg,0,far_neg,7739,far_neg_MEDLINE,0.0033244372,0
